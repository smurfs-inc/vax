                                                On 12/24 at around 10 PM, circulation to my 4th left digit significantly decreased after being outside of my car for around 15 minutes during a temperature of about 50 degrees. I realized when sharp pain was felt at the digit. After about 5 minutes the digit felt numb. I got in my car, turned on the heater, and massaged my finger. Sharp pain was felt again as circulation returned to the digit. The event last approximately 10 minutes from the moment I realized the finger was pale until color returned.   This occurred again on 12/27 at around 2 PM as I walked from my car into a store at a temperature of about 40 degrees. This time, discoloration occurred bilaterally on my left 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits and my right 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits.  The event lasted more than 15 minutes with constant massaging.   This has occurred two more times since then, both times occurring bilaterally with minimal exposure to cold.

                                                Approximately 15 min after vaccination began to experience tingling sensation under tongue. It was not bothersome so I proceeded to go home. At 2:04 pm, approximately 40 minutes after vaccination was driving home and began to experience an elevated HR, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing and throat tightness. Proceeded to pull over to a gas station and felt extremely weak when trying to walk and a tingling sensation all over.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl tablets and symptoms began to subside within about 10 minutes or so. Proceeded to continue driving home and had another episode at 2:49 pm, experienced significant shortness of breath and tingling sensation in mouth spread to back of tongue and it felt swollen. I bought liquid Benadryl instead and took ~20 mL. This episode resolved within 10-20 minutes as well and was okay for the rest of the evening.

Did not say anything and sat there for the 15 minutes with continued shortness of breath and high rate think it was anxiety. When the time was up I continued to stay at the hospital for an hour due to fear of bad reaction. Started to become extremely nauseous within 30 minutes and loss of appetite. Went to bed and woke up with a terrible headache, body aches, extreme fatigue and a 100.3 degree fever. Slept for 8 hours during the day waking up due to the pain in my body and chills but the symptoms went away by 5 pm the following day of the shot.

                                                I got my vaccine at 5:15pm on 1/14/2021. At 5:20pm on 1/14/2021 my heart started racing. My heart rate went up to 124 beats per minute. I was having flushing, tingling through my whole body. My blood pressure went up to 139/96. I was having itching and blotchiness on my chest, neck, left arm and thighs.This lasted for 3 hours with my heart rate going up and down. I was sent to the ER by the nurses who gave my vaccine. There they gave me Benadryl. 2 tablets of 25mg each. This helped and I was sent home.

This 26-year-old female patient (pregnant: no) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), intramuscular on 08Jan2021 at 07:45 AM at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety and depression. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (ZZZQUIL). No other-vaccine-in-four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), intramuscular on 22Dec2020 at 08:00 PM on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced tachycardia up to 150 resting, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, migraine, body aches, chills and fever up to 102. Symptom onset around 7PM on 08Jan2021 and stopped around 12PM 09Jan2021 except for headache which was still persisting as of 9PM 09Jan2021. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of headache was not recovered. The outcome of other events was recovered on 09Jan2021 at 12PM. The patient did not have COVID-prior-vaccination.

This persisted throughout the night and I did not sleep. Took 1000 mg of Acetaminophen at 5:30 and slept until 7 AM. By 8 AM, my temperature was back down to 98 F. Took 500 mg of Acetaminophen at 10 AM with food. Headache, muscle pain, and joint pain persisted. Moderate to severe chest pain began 15 mins after eating at 4 PM. Waited 30 mins to see if it resolved; it did not. Went to the urgent care. Chest x-ray and EKG was performed, no issues found. Was diagnosed with costochondritis and was given a steroid shot and ibuprofen,  which reduced the pain significantly within 30 mins later.

The night of 1/13/21, I fell asleep but awoke multiple times cold. I experienced the chills through about midnight. The next morning, 1/14/21, I woke up with a headache at about 5:30am. I took a dose of Aleve and the symptoms had subsided by about 6:30am

This reaction occurred within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine. Pt was pale, sweaty, diaphoretic, hypotensive and had bradycardia. Pt&#39;s systolic BP was in the 60s and her diastolic was in the 30s.  Pt was offered food but refused. Pt was immediately brought to the ER where her care was transferred to an ER nurse.

Headache and body aches have worsened in severity. Unable to work for the morning but was able to go in the afternoon for a short time period. Lower body aches are particularly severe. Fatigue is noticeable. Mental health conditions have worsened but that may be due to lack of sleep.  30 hours following the vaccine: chills, nausea, and dizziness have dissipated completely. They were slowly improving throughout the day. Body aches and headache still severe but lessened with marijuana use.  48 hours following the vaccine: all symptom seemed to have subsided during the night. Sleep was much better quality. Only remaining symptom is an ache on the right side of my chest towards my ribs.

Then came the shortness of breath and the feeling of pins and needles which also brought itching and some minor hives with it. The dizziness, nausea, and feeling of fainting went away after about 10 minutes and I had to go to the Emergency Department to take care of the shortness of breath and hive like reaction. I was given some medications and they diagnosed it as a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine. I was completely fine with the first one.

This was treated by reclining with feet up, sitting in a dark room, and drinking cold water while monitoring symptoms. Symptoms resolved within minutes.  About an hour after injection lethargy, feeling chilled, in particular hands were very cold, mental fog, and slurred speech. This resolved without intervention within a couple of hours.

For about 36 hours, it ran 100-130&#39;s; Dehydration; Feeling fatigued/Excessive fatigue; Had some general arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ 1686, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 08Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ 1685, unknown expiration) via intramuscular in right arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as needed and unspecified birth control. The patient has no known allergies. The patient started feeling fatigued about 1900 hours (07:00 PM) on 08Jan2021 and only had some general arm soreness. She woke up on 09Jan2021, with serious chills to the point of physical shaking; nausea started soon after and around 0300, began vomiting and dry heaving. The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the event &#34;having sweats&#34; was unknown, while the patient is recovering for the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported serious chill was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

                                                After receiving the second dose of the covid 19 vaccine, as I was walking to the elevator, my vision started to become blurred and I began to see stars. I walked over to a nearby chair and as I sat down it felt as if my throat was closing. I began sweating profusely and my whole body was flushed. My heart rate was tachycardic and my blood pressure was hypertensive when checked in the ED. When I got to the ED, my vitals were obtained like I described but my heart rate had slowed down by time I got there. A nurse passing by explained that my heart was tachycardia when he assessed me in the chair. The ED did an EKG of my heart that determined my heart rate was normal sinus rhythm in the 70s. They observed me for roughly an hour and let me go home. My discharge papers explain I had a vagal response.

A 26-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number= ELO140), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 14Jan2021 12:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: cephalosporins, coconut. Other medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Jan2021 at time of 05:00 AM, the patient experienced blisters around hips, thighs, and elbows; Intermittent chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath beginning one day after vaccine and continuing into day 4 DOST vaccine, swollen lymph nodes under bilateral arms that had not decreased, chills and sweating, headache. No treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures post vaccination which included COVID nasal swab test and COVID PCR test, both were negative on 14Jan2021. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported blisters around hips, thighs, and elbows; Intermittent chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath beginning one day after vaccine was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 2 minutes after injection, I had a sudden rush of warmth throughout my body starting in my abdomen then causing my pulse to feel like it was pounding out of my neck. Got light headed. EMS came and my blood pressure raised to 155/95 and my pulse was up in the 150s and I was shaking.  Started to go down but felt crappy for over 2 hours. Happened again 30seconds after the second injection. Pulse up to almost 160. 02 stats stayed normal. Post first injection had sore arm and lots of fatigue and brain fog. Following the second injection 12 hours post started having nausea, and diarrhea. Continued to have joint pain, muscle aches, headaches for days, and my lymph nodes swelled up and were extremely painful.

                                                I am a pharmacist for pharmacy and received my first dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine while at work by another pharmacist.  Vaccine given around 2:15 PM on 2/2/21  Less than 5 minutes after vaccine - arm tingling at site of injection, arm tingling spread from injection site to fingers, tingling and pins/needles traveled through underarm area and moved across left side of chest, slight chest pain on left side, whole body started tingling, dizziness, racing heart. While experiencing all of these symptoms, I sat on the ground, took two tablets of 25mg Benadryl, drank water, and tried to breath steady to make dizziness go away. Working in this healthcare setting, I was aware I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and was prepared with an epi-pen in case of any severe anaphylaxis shock - I did NOT have to use the epi-pen.    Less than 15 minutes after vaccine - the chest pain, arm pins/needles stopped, I felt lightheaded still, another co-worker checked my blood pressure which had risen to 178/120 and pulse of 120.   About 1 hour after vaccine - still felt light headed, blood pressure still elevated at 158/107, pulse of 107.   Around 5:45 PM - After consulting personal friend physicians, I was instructed to go to ER and have an EKG of my heart since my blood pressure and pulse had spiked so high and suddenly. I was able to find coverage at work so that I could leave my shift and get a ride to the emergency room.   After 6 PM (admitted into ER) - upon admission blood pressure of 176/117 and pulse of 113

                                                Went to ED on 1/14/21. emailed caregiver for information. As far as what happened, I received my 2nd dose of Pfizer on Jan. 13th @ 05:15 at hospital and started feeling symptoms roughly six hours later, symptoms being nausea, chills, splitting headaches, muscle fatigue, feeling tired and joint pain. I had understood that these side effects were common and not to worry, however, the next day on Jan. 14th around 11:00am, I blacked out at home. Luckily, my partner had caught me before I feel to the ground, but he stated that my eyes had glazed over, my breathing was shallow, and I hardly had a pulse. He was getting ready to do chest compressions, but I had come out of whatever fog that had knocked me down and became responsive. Around 12:00 pm I had arrived at the ED where they had given me a bag on NS, Zofran for the nausea and Toradol for some inflammation management. I believe I discharged from the ED around 15:20.

A 26-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration into the upper left arm on 05Jan2021 at single dose as a precaution because she works in nursing home (COVID-19 immunisation). Medical history included Covid positive back in Oct2020. Concomitant medication included biotin and one a day women&#39;s vitamin. Family members have medical issues. Dad has heart tumors, seizure, sleep apnea and osteoporosis. Mom has asthma, diabetes, has had cancer, neuropathy and macular degeneration. The patient received first dose of the covid vaccine on 05Jan2021 and had some symptoms after the vaccine. On unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient hard large lump that hurts at the injection site, chest pain and shortness of breath; similar to when she had Covid positive back in October. She still has a lump at the injection side which has gotten smaller in size but still hurts to touch. Left arm has a knot in it from injection site; does not reuired ER or visit to physician&#39;s office. It feels like a bump with something in her arm. She doubts that is the case. She wanted to see if that was normal and when it might go away, especially since she should be getting second dose on 26Jan2021. She is a speech therapist. There is no prescriber. They came and gave to everyone all at once. It was really big at first. It felt like someone punched her. It was a big giant lump, but it is getting better. The injection was given in the upper left arm and it felt like it went into the muscle. The outcome of the event vaccination site mass was recovering, and the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

The patient developed sharp pain soon after which persisted for two days. Soon after she started with neurological symptoms including increased sweating in the affected arm, pain in the branchial plexus region, including arm and forearm, paresthesias in arm, forearm, and fingers, sensation of scapula being dislocated, and tightening sensation in the lateral aspect of the chest. Symptoms are worsening every day. There is a high suspicion that she is developing Parsonage-Turner syndrome.

The staff gave me an injection of Benadryl into my right arm. The spot reduced in size over the duration of an hour and I was sent home with instructions to take OTC Benadryl until the swelling disappeared completely later that evening.  Event #2: Shortness of breath and chest tightness beginning exactly 74hrs after the vaccination (Sunday, 01/31/2021 at 2:15pm).

I had only been driving for a few minutes, maybe less than five when I felt like my arm I got the shot in started to go numb and soon followed a feeling of lightheadness. I thought about pulling off to the side but didn&#39;t make it in time because the next thing I knew I woke up pressed against the median on the other side of the freeway I was driving on. I completely blacked out while driving. I had to call an ambulance because I was freaked out and wanted to be looked at and my car needed to be towed.

A 26-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 11:30 at a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Other medical history and known allergies were reported as none. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the report and vaccination. Concomitant medications included zinc, ascorbic acid (VIT C), ergocalciferol (VIT D) and an unspecified birth control medication. The first dose of BNT162B2 (brand: Pfizer as reported) was received on 06Jan2021 12:00 PM in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient had no other vaccine in the four weeks prior to second dose vaccination. On 27Jan2021 23:00, the patient experienced nose bleed, fever of 102, severe injection site swelling (grapefruit size), lethargy, tachycardia, shortness of breath, severe joint pain, migraine and muscle pain. The patient did not receive treatments for the reported adverse events. Patient had COVID test post vaccination specified as nasal swab on 27Jan2021 with test result as negative. The events were reported as recovered with lasting effects.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the close drug-event temporal association and the location,  the reasonable possibility that the reported severe injection site swelling is related to BNT162B2 seems likely.

It is still hurting.; Tenderness; Feeling faint/Felt dizzy; Some trouble breathing; disoriented; Fatigue; Chills; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information Team. A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 28Jan2021 at 16:55 (reported as 4:55 PM) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. It was given at a vaccination clinic. The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks and had no adverse events following prior vaccinations and that was why she thought she would be fine. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included anxiety, peanut allergy, tree nut allergy, and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. Family history included her dad has heart disease and her half sister has heart disease. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization. The patient stated, &#34;You kind of feel yucky after the flu vaccine, but she has never had this with a flu shot.&#34; The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t had a flu shot in years. The patient asked if arm swelling was a normal occurrence after vaccination and if side effects can last for 4 days. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan and afterwards experienced, arm swelling, and tenderness that has last for 4 days. She also reported experiencing feeling faint, high blood pressure of 150/100 and some trouble breathing on an unspecified date and nausea. The patient further reported that she was calling because she got her first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine and she was curious if this was normal and if she needs to go see her doctor and she wants to report the symptoms. After she got the injection she felt super faint and got really high blood pressure on an unspecified date. She was not sure if it was because she had anxiety, but she had trouble breathing on an unspecified date. She got nauseated afterwards. Her arm swelled up really big and the swelling has stayed there for four days. Her arm was still swollen on an unspecified date. She has allergies and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. She was still nauseated and feels super tired. The patient asked how long do the symptoms last. The patient&#39;s weight was reported between 122 to 123 pounds. The patient clarified that the nausea started 15 minutes after she got the shot on 28Jan2021. The nausea has lasted through this. She got chills the next day (29Jan2021) after the shot. She has felt super fatigue. The swelling has gone down, but it was still swollen. It was still hurting. She has no idea if that was normal. She also felt dizzy and disoriented after getting the shot. She was not sure if it was because her blood pressure was so high. It was high for her because her blood pressure was normally low. She thinks her blood pressure 150/100 after she got the vaccine. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

I had high blood pressure 180/120, facial puffiness and mild bottom lip swelling. I developed an onset of increased mucus in my throat causing me to clear my throat frequently. RN on site reported no throat swelling, but increased thickness due to mucus. I received a Benadryl injection on site within 30 minutes and almost immediately symptoms began to lessen. The next day I had mild bottom lip swelling, body itchiness, chest rash, headache and fatigue. Today (24 hours after vaccine) I have a headache, fatigue and body itchiness.

About 5 minutes after leaving 11:30 I could taste the vaccine in my mouth. I immediately felt intense sharp tingling in my lower lip, it felt hot and swollen (upper lip never had a reaction). I instantly felt a lump in my throat and had a hard time swallowing. I started with chest pain that resolved itself in a minute or two. A few minutes later a family member noticed my face was red and flushed and said I looked like I had a sun burn. Swelling in throat resolved within an hour. Lip never visually looked swollen but I could feel the tightness, burning and tingling that resolved within the hour. Redness on face resolved within a couple hours. Had tiny blisters about 3 show up above upper lip I still have them the next day with a couple more but they aren&#39;t causing problems. My airway was never blocked I never had a hard time breathing. I did have a sore throat this morning March 25 day after vaccine. All other symptoms seem normal.

                                                As soon as the vaccine was injected my arm hurt through my neck to the back of my shoulder blade. I was immediately feeling woozy and dizzy. I sat for 20 minutes and took a Tylenol. I left the site and about 30 minutes later I was feeling extremely tired, and out of breath. Talking was difficult and taking too much energy, my shortness of breath was alarming. It went away within 4 hours.  2 days later I was feeling fine, and was sitting having a coffee. Out of nowhere I had a rapid heartbeat and started feeling woozy and light headed again. I didn&#39;t have as much shortness of breath but it felt like if I were to try and do anything it would exhaust me. I took Tylenol again and things calmed down in about 2-3 hours.

Reports the rest of the day felt tachycardiac for a few hours (HR 120-140) and dizzy. Started getting muscle aches/joint aches. Denies any recent COVID exposure. Tested positive for COVID In 8/2020. Reports hips/knees are throbbing today; Heart rate WNL.   ///    Presenting today due to intermittent presyncope and palpitations. Also notes generalized weakness. Patient evaluate 2 L of fluid given her Mirena IUD D-dimer was sent which was negative patient with no pleuritic symptoms or dyspnea to suggest pulmonary embolism. Otherwise hemodynamically stable on exam ambulates with no difficulty no focal neurologic deficits. Patient did describe on her initial presentation that she noted some weakness of her bilateral legs. Given her possible viral reaction and description of weakness it is possible the patient is developing an early autoimmune reaction however she has no evidence of GuillainBarré or transverse myelitis on my exam. We will plan to discharge with neurology follow-up as outpatient.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine, I began having chills and vomited. My fatigue became more severe as well. Later that evening my fatigue persisted and I noticed a rapid heart rate via my Watch. My resting heart rate which usually is about 80 BPM was at 100 while laying down and not engaged in any physical activity. When I stood I was dizzy and had poor balance. While my entire arm no longer hurt, the injection site showed a bump as well. When I awoke the next day my heart rate appeared normal again, and I wasn&#39;t especially fatigued compared to before I got the vaccine. I did experience another minor gastro-intestinal episode later that afternoon, but otherwise my symptoms appeared to have passed aside from the fatigue. By the end of my work day I was very tired again, although it is uncertain if this is due to the vaccine or from my continued recovery from Covid and adjusting to the physical demands of going back to my job in-person. Because I received my vaccine on the same day as my first day back to work, I have no experience working post-covid before having the vaccine to compare my current state of fatigue to. On the evening of 01/07 I noted that fatigue was slightly less pronounced. I do not currently have a primary care doctor but will be calling to try to gain an appointment so that my second dose can be monitored.

It wasa very scary experience for me. This lasted about 15 or 20 minutes I&#39;m guessing (hard to say for sure because I was too worked up to watch the clock) but I ended up making myself fall back asleep. The next day January 8th I had diarrhea multiple times in theafternoon and felt strange, somewhat lightheaded and some what felt like anxiety.

I felt really dizzy and nauseated, I felt like I could not walk. I felt like I hit by a bus. The next day I had heavy flu symptoms, high fever, continuous chest pain and high HR, at the ER they gave me a high dose of Benadryl, steroids and fluids. I took Benadryl for about 7 days and I still felt light headed palpitations and fever for almost 2 weeks. I also was tested for COVID and it was negative. I was advised to not take the second vaccine. I still have a really bad fatigue. It is the symptom that is still on and off.

                                                When I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID shot I had no issues. When I received the second dose I had the vaccine injected and then I got up and walked to the monitoring room where we sit for 15 minutes. Immediately upon sitting down in that room I felt very woozy, lightheaded, and my heart was beating out of my chest. I checked my pulse on my smart watch and it was in the 80s but my resting HR is normally in the 60s or 70s. I got nervous at that point so I took some deep breaths and tried to relax and my symptoms improved within a minute. I sat for the remainder of the monitoring period and right at my 15 minute mark all of my symptoms returned. HR in the 100s, lightheaded like I was going to pass out, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath. I alerted the nurse in the monitoring room and she took my BP and HR and they have me a bottle of water. My throat felt a little weird too and I was worried that it was starting to close up, but I was able to swallow  water normally. I remained in the monitoring room for about 15 more minutes and at that point my symptoms mostly resolved and I felt well enough to leave. For the next approx 48 hours I have had some mild- moderate chest heaviness. More worse in the initial 24-36 hours after the vaccination.

About 18 hours after the vaccination, the patient was getting up to take more paracetamol (TYLENOL) and did not feel well. The patient had a syncope episode in the bathroom (no issues as she sat on the floor before hand). The patient was unconscious for about 1-2 minutes. The patient&#39;s blood pressure several minutes later was low, about 90/50; however, the patient took the blood pressure measurement herself, so it may not have been exactly accurate. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: low, about 90/50 on 09Jan2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of all reported serious events cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.

Thursday I just felt red, itchy, swollen L arm due to vaccination site. Friday morning my bottom lip was severely swollen with numbness and tingling. It went down by the next day and after taking Benadryl. I have not had an allergic reaction to anything in my life before. Was instructed to not get second vaccine as I may have a more increased reaction to it.

I was laid down and vital signs were taken. My heart rate was in the 110s and 120s and stayed elevated for about four hours. The hives resolved and did not spread to the bilateral arm or anywhere else. The following two days I felt incredibly weak and had urinary frequency. I was told to go to the hospital by the health clinic staff but I declined.

I tried to bear down at home to decrease my heart rate but it continued to climb to 164 so after an hour of sustained Hr 126-164 I went to the emergency room where I had SVT. They did a valsalva maneuver 3 times and that made my heart rate go down to the 130s. It was then sinus tachycardia and stayed 120s-130s until about noon. Upon discharge at 3:30pm my resting heart rate was still 105 but it was determined to be a vaccine reaction as all other tests were normal.

                                                within minutes after my shot, I started to have difficulty swallowing. i was monitored for 30 minutes at the vaccine site before being escorted to the medical observation area. While in the medical observation area I tried to take a sip of water but could not swallow it. At that moment I began having a tight feeling in my chest. I began to hyperventilate followed by difficulty breathing or talking. This was accompanied by feelings of impending doom, and uncontrollable trembling and inability to concentrate on what the medical observation area Doctor was saying. The time from the drink of water until I was able to breathe, speak, and concentrate normally was about 20 minutes. Tightness in my chest has improved but not fully recovered. General malaise and headache have developed.

The chest pain made it unbearable to move and lasted about 2 minutes. As my husband and I were ready to go to the hospital, the pain subsided. It did not come back for the remainder of the night or the next two days, but I still have minor chest soreness lingering.

I felt bad for nine days after vaccination. I was still exhausted for another week at work. I got the second dose and had no problems.

                                                Less than 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I experienced tingling in my left fingers. Less than 15 minutes of receiving the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath.  I thought I was having an asthma attack, so I proceeded to use my inhaler. After using the inhaler, I started coughing while trying to breathe.  Next my tongue started swelling, followed by my throat and back of the tongue.  The nurses / EMT reported that my face turned red and my heart-rate was elevated.  The EMT proceeded to give me EpiPen, which almost instantly caused the swelling in my tongue to go down.  While being monitored for 3 more hours at the emergency room, the swelling went down even more and breathing became more normal.  The following day, I visited my allergist doctor, and I was still experiencing some swelling in my neck and chest tightness.  I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to clear the rest of the allergic reaction.

                                                27 year old female comes in 3/27/21 at 4:15pm to get Pfizer COVID vaccine. She has no family doctor. On her VAR form she states no seizure or history of seizure but does have reaction to HPV vaccine where her throat swelled up and her MD had to give her oxygen year ago. I asked about any other reactions to any other vaccinations and she said no and was willing to get this vaccine.  I told her to wait 30 minutes after vaccination to make sure no reaction. At 4:25pm her sister and mom tell us that patient is feeling week and dizzy and ask for water, I go out and check and she is pale and is ready to faint. Mother asks for orange juice which she takes a sip. I ask her if she has any health conditions like diabetes, seizures and they say no, then patient has what looks like a petit mal (absence) seizure. While sitting in the chair her eyes flutter, roll back she tenses up and her body freezes for about 20-30 seconds. I tell staff to call 911 and her sister says she&#39;s having &#34;another&#34; seizure. We don&#39;t move her but make sure she doesn&#39;t fall, once the seizure passes we move her to the ground to lie down. She regains consciousness and is coherent but confused. I do not give EpiPen because I witnessed a seizure. The fire and ambulance arrive to assist her and then her family mentions she did have seizures years ago. After 20 minutes or around 4:50pm she feels better and does not want to go to the hospital and walks out assisted by fire/ambulance staff. The next day I call her and she says she feels better and just has a sore arm and will find new doctor check her out.

After feeling very weak and sick all day, she passed out for approx 30&#43; minutes, she was alone but was found on the floor by her mother after she attempted to call her multiple times and she didn&#39;t respond. She experienced seizure like activity and was advised by her primary care doctor to go to the emergency room, and was seen there. Start date for the adverse events reported as 15Mar2021 at 16:00. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. There was no treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

This 27-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 10Mar2021 10:15 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;one number on there is EN and then she does not know if it is a G or 6 and then 204&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing anxiety from 2020, ongoing acid problems from 2020, high cholesterol levels from 2020 (she was not prescribed any medication and the advice given was just for diet and exercise), and ongoing gallbladder problem for years. There were no concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 10Mar2021, patient had eye puffiness in her left eye. Patient asked if it is safe to take the second dose. Her eyelid got puffy which began 30 minutes after having the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and it is not ongoing but resolved completely after a few minutes. She did not require treatment for the eye puffiness and the puffiness was mostly on her upper eyelid of her left eye. Patient stated that she does not know in terms of causality if the Pfizer COVID vaccine is related to the reported events and was worried because a week after she got the vaccine, she had other symptoms and was not sure if they are connected with the vaccine. She also reported that she does not think the eye puffiness itself is that serious but it is medically significant and the other symptoms she had were chest pain, chest heaviness, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are not ongoing anymore and began around Friday, 19Mar2021 and resolved after a couple of hours of when they began. For the chest pain, chest heaviness and abdominal pain, she just took an antacid Prilosec for treatment. She thought about going to the emergency room but also thought she was having an anxiety attack and was close to having to go to the emergency room that night. She did get pretty anxious easily and that probably exacerbated it. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events had eye puffiness in her left eye and eyelid got puffy/puffiness mostly on her upper eyelid of her left eye was recovered on 10Mar2021, of the event &#34;anxiety attack/she did get pretty anxious easily and that probably exacerbated it&#34; was unknown, and of the other events was recovered in Mar2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the contributory role of the suspect bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to reported events is possible.

Her initial EKG was negative for any acute changes but her troponin was elevated. Cardiology was consulted. Her echo was negative for cardiomyopathy or hypertrophy. But after her troponin continued to rise she was taken to the cath lab to look for ischemia. Her cardiac angiography was negative for obstructive disease, and coronary arteries were completely normal. Had low magnesium and potassium- so started on oral supplementation. Discharged on 03/22/2021 with nitroglycerin (which was not helpful and made her feel worse/nauseated) and to follow up with outpatient cardiac MRI and cardiology. This imaging revealed significant myocardial edema consistent with myocarditis.   04/01/2021 Per Cardiology: -Given that the patient had covid 19 back in November 2019 I believe she may have had a low yield subacute myocardial infection at that time that was somehow exacerbated by her 1st covid vaccine. Therefore, after some consideration and careful discussion I am advising against the 2nd vaccine at this time.  -No physical exercise for 6 months given her current myocarditis and family hx of sudden cardiac death -May trial PRN NSAIDS for pain relief -Recommend birth control and no pregnancy until at least after her follow up cMRI  -Follow up in 6 months with cMRI prior

                                                This is a 27 y.o. female with a PMH of hypothyroidism, obesity, and chronic migraines who presented to Lakeside ED on 4/13/21 for evaluation of chest pain. In the ED, her troponin was elevated at 1.73. EKG showed NSR with nonspecific t-wave abnormality. CTA chest and CXR were negative for acute findings. She was given 325 mg aspirin and cardiology was consulted. HMS was asked to admit for ongoing evaluation and management.    Her troponin was trended and peaked at 9.59, trended down to 8.18 on the day of discharge.  Echocardiogram showed normal LVEF at 62% and no wall motion abnormalities. Her CRP was elevated at 25.5. Cardiac MRI 4/14 showed evidence of epicardial delayed enhancement consistent with myocarditis, no evidence of myocardial infarction. She was diagnosed with myocarditis, possibly related to recent Pfizer COVID vaccination (vs other viral etiologies). ID was consulted and added on labs to rule out a mild case of MIS-A as well.  Labs pending at time of d/c (ferritin, d dimer, CRP/ESR, COVID total AB, and IL-6).  Depending on results, PCP may consider outpatient referral to rheumatology.

                                                About 27 hours after my vaccine (at about 9 pm on 01/12) I began having 8-10/10 chest pain. Mostly burning sharp pain, but some restricting tight pain as well, radiating to my back mostly. It would be relieved for maybe 10 minutes at a time but then flare back up for about 5 hours. I went to the emergency room, where they did a cardiac work up including blood work and EKG, vitals and a chest X-ray, all which were unremarkable. At about 0200 am on 01/13, the pain subsided. Previous to the chest pain, during the morning and afternoon of 01/12, I had a low grade fever (99.9 F), an intense headache, and fatigue. 01/14/21 sore swollen lymph node under L arm.

                                                I got the COVID Pfizer vaccine and experienced warmth in my chest with the first vaccine. It went away after one day and was tolerable. I also developed a lump under my right armpit with the first dose that slowly went away. It was painful, but the pain was tolerable. With the second vaccine, I also got the chest warmth and chest pressure for 2 days. I did not seek help as it was also tolerable. I also developed the lump under my armpit with the 2nd dose, this time I still have it and it is more painful and bigger. I have been taking naproxen for the pain.

                                                I was awoken from sleep with violent chills and an sensation of severe cold. My chills became violent and coarse rigors, severe enough to contract the spine into hyperextension if I kept my body in a neutral position. I could still activate each muscle group to keep in a fetal prostration pose. I was knowledgeable of the event, did not loose any bowel, bladder, or smooth muscle function, and the intensity of the rigors was focused on the most developed skeletal muscles (thighs, calves, upper arms, forearms, paraspinal muscles, hands, respectively).  Jaw and muscles of the head/face seemed unaffected. Fingers and toes not distinctly affected. I was not sweating at this time and there were NO other symptoms to report; I remained lucid and able to self-reflect the entire time. Home temperature is kept to consistent 66F, no malfunctions to thermostat. No recent changes to bedding (sheet and quit on top of mattress); it is even optimized for me as I tend to overheat as I sleep.   At 50 minutes, I felt &#34;less frozen&#34; and confident enough to stand/ambulate for 220mg naproxen &#43; 500mg APAP , cautiously and successfully swallowed. Robe was donned over existing pajamas and thick comforter was pulled from hallway closet. Rigors continued, but it appeared that intentional activation of the muscle groups could still overpower the rigors for safe (but shaky) ambulation. Greatest risk was coarsely shaking hands a bringing cup to mouth to swallow pills.   Above activity was completed in 5 minutes. I then sat upright in bed under layers above. I could feel the muscles calm and relax, with episode completely ending in 5 minutes. Total time of event: 60 minutes.   Post-event details: There was a mild sensation of muscle tension in the posterior cervical spine akin to whiplash, but no residual symptoms. I debriefed with my husband shortly thereafter (he has been in another room the whole time) and fell asleep by 23:30. Awoke to alarm at 05:00 and able to stretch, accomplish 30 min run, vacuum/mop the floors, and present to work by 08:00am without deficit.  Time of documentation: 11:22 am 1/15/2021

I took some deep breathes and started to feel better. Then as I walked out to my car and on my drive home, my whole face felt like some type of electricity was racing through it. I would touch my face and wherever I touched, the skin would feel tight and tingling. This lasted for 30-40 minutes and never came back.

She had proactively taken diphenhydramine following the reaction to her first dose.  Around 08:40 AM,  she began to feel tightening in her throat and some heaviness in her chest. She was evaluated by a nurse who took her blood pressure (normal), however, her heart rate was elevated (noted this could be that she was nervous following initial reaction and repeat tightness in throat).  Around 08:55AM, she began to feel like her tongue was swelling and that she had a &#34;bubble&#34; on the top of her throat. She was taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She was given hydroxyzine, famotidine, and dexamethasone in the ED and was discharged and felt stable.  She reported a continued odd sensation in her throat the evening of the second vaccination.  This feeling resolved the next day, and she reports no additional side effects from the vaccine.   Of note, patient had experienced a similar reaction following her first vaccination (E-number 261589)

I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

While laying in bed the room was spinning.

                                                After my 2nd dose administration, I sat in an observation tent with 4 resident doctors. This is protocol at my hospital to assess for any adverse reactios. About 10 minutes later, I started to feel both of my arms (from should all the way to tips of my fingers) start to get tingly with an intense vibrating sensation. I tried to calm myself down, however numbness began to occur to both BUE seconds after. Next thing that happened, bilateral fingers became visually contracted however numb and I could not move my fingers. I also got a tingly/prickly sensation to my cheeks all the way down to my chin after the hand numbess. The resident doctors quickly took me by wheelchair to a private room where they checked my vital signs. BP was elevated with systolic in 190&#39;s, HR around 120s, and my limbs were all cold. By this time it was around 6pm and they were trying to calm me down as I started to have a panic attack. My parents came to pick me up at 7pm when my vitals were stable. I rested at home, and the contraction to my fingers/numbess did not subside until 8:30pm.  The following day, my left arm (injection site) had a soreness level of 9/10. Tylenol was used to relieve pain.

A 28-years-old female patient received dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 28Jan2021 10:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

On 28Jan2021, the patient experienced fatigue throughout the day increased. The patient developed headache. Awoke around 28Jan2021 23:00 with aches, chills, severe headache, weakness, dizziness, and nausea. She did not feel she could move safely to retrieve OTC medications for these symptoms which were far worse than any illness she can recall having. She likely would have went to the ER for help but she couldn&#39;t have driven herself and her kids were home. She did not want to call 911. On 28Jan2021 23:00, she did experience an episode of nearly passing out sometime during the night when she attempted to sit up on the edge of the bed to take some Tylenol. She could not regulate her temperature as she fluctuated between being diaphoretic and cold to being overheated. In the morning she finally felt well enough to go to her medicine cabinet downstairs and decided to essentially sedate herself for the day with Benadryl, Xanax, zofran, Tylenol, and ibuprofen. She then slept from about 10am until about 5pm. She felt considerably better upon waking up, with just fatigue, nausea, and headache. The report was reported as non-serious. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not pregnant. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events fatigue, nausea and headache was not resolved and the outcome of the other events was resolving.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested

                                                3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt a sense of panic and a tingling on my lips, that then spread to my mouth, throat, and tongue. I asked the nurse if my lips were swollen, and she said no.  A few minutes later my heart rate increased and I felt really lightheaded. After 7-10 minutes I felt my tongue tingling and it had become swollen. I told the nurse that I think my tongue was swollen and she said it looked okay. I had a hard time talking because I wasn&#39;t used to be tongue being so large. The nurses stayed and talked to me for the rest of the 30 minute waiting period. I was able to talk and breath while making a conscious effort.  I wasn&#39;t sure whether the high heart rate and lightheadedness were associated with my condition, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. I kept checking my tongue to see how swollen it was.  After the 30 minutes, the nurses had me stand up to see if I could. Once I could, they said I was all set to go. They did not get an Epi-pen for the swollen tongue or give me instructions on how to treat it. They were insensitive and dismissive of my symptoms. they kept repeating &#34;I think your just nervous.&#34; Once I got home, I still had the swollen tongue and tingling, but was able to go up and down stairs and go about my day. It was a little difficult to swallow one of my pills when I got home, but I was able to. I checked my blood pressure around 4:30 p.m. and it was 121/84 and my pulse was 79 bpm sitting. I did not take anything to treat my swollen tongue. The swollen tongue and tingling feeling in my throat continued for another 2.5 hours, until 6:00 p.m. Once the swelling was down, my tongue felt like I burnt it on a hot beverage, almost a numb feeling. I also experienced more common side effects such as body aches, fatigue, and feeling feverish.   After this episode I had extremely high anxiety where it was difficult for me to sleep the following night. I called a 24/7 nurse line and she said to talk to my doctor. I had less than 4 hours sleep the night after I had my vaccine.  I called my doctor&#39;s office this morning and I spoke to a nurse who worked as a nurse on the COVID Vaccine hotline.  She relayed the message to the doctor who was covering for my doctor while she&#39;s on medical leave. I received a call around 9:30 a.m. saying that the doctor on leave recommend I should talk to my PCP but that she thought I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and that I should not get the second dose. She said they were not sure how I would react with the second dose, and they&#39;re afraid that my allergic response might be more severe and life threatening.  I hope this report helps other people who experience these symptoms.

                                                Symptoms: Fainting, Unconciouness (repeatedly), Profusive Sweating, Low Blood Pressure (60 over unknown number), Nausea, Dizziness, Unable to stabilize quickly, not able to get an IV, extreme thirst  Signs: Immediately felt unwell within 5 minutes of the vaccine.  Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

A 28-year-old non-pregnant female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Feb2021 15:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, migraines, asthma, hay fever, acid reflux, hives when exercising outdoors in the cold, and allergies: latex, cats, dustmites, gluten and dairy intolerance; all from unknown dates. Concomitant medications included sumatriptan, bupropion, pepsin, calcium carbonate and unspecified herbs. The patient did not received other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took fluconazole (DIFLUCAN) and experienced allergies. A few minutes after taking the vaccine, the patient experienced a tingling feeling in lips, which then spread to mouth, throat and tongue. The patient told a nurse and she said that she looked fine. The patient asked if lips were swollen but they weren&#39;t. Then a few minutes later she felt very lightheaded and had an elevated heart rate. Then around this time, she saw her tongue was swollen to about double the size. The nurse said she looked fine, and monitored her for 30 minutes then let her go. This swollen tongue lasted for about 2.5 - 3 hours. After the swelling subsided, tongue felt like it was numb/burnt by drinking a hot liquid. 12 hours later, she woke up in the middle of the night with an elevated heart rate and had trouble sleeping. The patient spoke to her doctor and it sounds like she had an allergic reaction, even though she have no history of allergies for any of the vaccine ingredients. Onset date of all events were reported as 25Feb2021 15:30. Outcome of all events reported as recovered on an unspecified date. No treatment was given for all events. The patient was not diagnosed of covid prior vaccination and has not tested for covid post vaccination.

That weekend I had heart palpitations, the Monday after my standing heart rate chest xray, ddimer - possible lung collapse, any exertion my heart rate would elevate, they performed an MRI with contrast, there could be a blood clot in the lung so I went to see a cardiologist, They put me on epinolol and did an echocardiogram, everything else checked out in my tests. I have not recovered my breathing still bothers me and my heart rate still elevates with exertion.

                                                3/18: Chest pain. It woke me up in the middle of the night with some dizziness. At first, I disregarded it, then I tried falling asleep again, but I was jolted awake again with worse symptoms - vertigo, palpitations. I measured my HR, it was all over the place and irregular. Went to the ER, they didnt find anything substantial on my EKG other than arrhythmia with short PR. No treatment was given, instructed to follow up with PCP. Left ER between 4AM-5AM. Was able to go back to sleep, but the chest pain woke me up around 7 AM. The chest pain remained fairly constant with severity changing throughout the day. Symptoms were worse at night and more: inability to sleep, sometimes restlessness - the need to move, increased chest pain/tightness/burning, palpitations. Saw PCP on 3/19, she didnt have any of the lab results, but prescribed metoprolol - this medication was misunderstood as to when I was supposed to take it, therefore didnt start it until another visit that I had with my PCP on 3/22. Over the weekend, I took some ibuprofen to try to lessen the chest pain, it helped a little bit but not for long. Began taking metoprolol 3/22. I didnt sleep more than 2-3 hrs from 3/18-3/22

The pain went away but came back 5 hours after second vaccine dose. In the next 10 hours, the pain became severe and constant; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 28-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ER8734), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 02Apr2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 12Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EP7534) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included corneal abrasion and pain in my calf, both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included tetryzoline hydrochloride (EYE DROPS [TETRYZOLINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced DVT in her right calf on an unspecified date and &#39;felt pain in my calf between 10-20 hours before second vaccine dose. the pain went away but came back 5 hours after second vaccine dose. in the next 10 hours, the pain became severe and constant&#39; on 02Apr2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient felt pain in her calf between 10-20 hours before second vaccine dose. The pain went away but came back 5 hours after second vaccine dose.

A 28-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 28-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 07Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included autism, being nervous, passed out, and anxiety. Concomitant medications included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), quetiapine fumarate (SEROQUEL), gabapentin, bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and lorazepam (ATIVAN) for being nervous. The patient received the Pfizer vaccine last Wednesday (07Apr2021) and immediately after that, at about 1:30 (unspecified), she just started having a seizure. They thought that it was more of a major response she was just having, fighting and was nervous about it, but it was kind of a different situation. The reporter has seen the patient passed out before. She did some blood test on 07Apr2021 and her sugars were fine. The reporter&#39;s concern was that they didn&#39;t know whether she should get the second one. The reporter didn&#39;t believe she got a seizure but was not sure about it. It&#39;s just that what immediately happened after she got the shot was that she passed out and they called the ambulance. After she passed out, she went to the emergency room and they did blood work on her. The reporter just did not know if they were going to let her go for the second dose because they couldn&#39;t relay if it was a seizure or a bizarre response where she just syncope and fainted. They were just thinking it was a bizarre response as it was just blood pressure drop but they were just not sure where to go from here. The patient was told to rest and intravenous fluid and something through the blood were given. The patient also experienced sore arm from 07Apr2021 for 2 days and had a low-grade fever the following day (08Apr2021). The outcome of the event sore arm was recovered on 09Apr2021 and recovered on Apr2021 for all other events.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                PE; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse. A 28-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: Ek9231), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm, at the age of 28 years, on 12Jan2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, angiolipoma, labral surgery to hip, drug hypersensitivity to penicillins; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ethinylestradiol, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE 1/20) and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]); both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced drug hypersensitivity, bactrium ds and experienced drug hypersensitivity, doxycycline and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient received first dose of COVID vaccine BNT162B2 (lot number= Ej1685) at the age of 28 years on 22Dec2020 on the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that 2 weeks after the second vaccine, she underwent hip labral surgery and suffered a PE on 22Feb2021. She was not sure if the vaccine could have contributed to the PE or just the surgery but wanted to report just incase. She was taking aspirin to prevent DVT&#39;s. The patient was hospitalized for pe (pulmonary embolism) for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 22Feb2021. Therapeutic measures (DOAC) were taken as a result of pe (pulmonary embolism). The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event pulmonary embolism is likely an intercurrent medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2. Patient&#39;s hip surgery two weeks after the vaccine might have contributed to the event onset.

                                                Within 7 hours of receiving the vaccine, I started what I thought was my second period of the month. I had just finished a period 12 days earlier. I am usually 35 - 42 days between periods so this was VERY unusual for me. I had my normal period pre-vaccine Jan 4 - 9 then 7 hours after the vaccine started bleeding again from the 21-25 of January. Then again on Feb 4 - 9. I got my second vaccine while bleeding. Then again started to bleed on Feb 21 - 25. I had a doctors appointment at the end of February. I got an annual gyno exam as well as a ton of bloodwork was taken to check everything out. I was told to continue to monitor the bleeding and if it didn&#39;t stop we would do a pelvic ultrasound. Well, it didn&#39;t stop so we did and it came back normal. I had a mostly normal March with light bleeding. I thought perhaps it was getting better but no. I have had two periods in April. In fact still bleeding on round two and this is my 6th day bleeding. Periods or irregular bleeding was April 12-17 and then again on April 24 - 29 (still happening and it&#39;s the 29th). This is very scary to me as no doctors can help.

Became slightly short of breath and felt my heart was racing. Took 25 mg of oral Benadryl and told to go to ED.  In ED heart rate was 126 bpm and BP WAS 136/99. Monitored in the ED for a few hours with no  further interventions. Heart rate improved to 102 bpm and blood pressure to 129/82.

No itching or hives. 1/9/21 at 3am my heart rate started to increase to about 110bpm while sleeping and continued till 4am. 1/9/21 at 4am my apple watch alerted me to my heart rate was above 120bpm while resting. This is when I realized I was sweating and felt like I had a fever.  I drank water and went back to sleep. 1/9/21 5am heart rate was at 135. then 6am 148bpm. 7am around 161bpm. Kept trying to go back to sleep. 1/9/21 8am got up and took an adult benadryl tablet and drank plenty of water. Tried to relax to lower my heart rate.  1/9/21 9am took another adult benadryl tablet and was able to get my heart rate just below 120 while sitting. Then ate breakfast and went back to bed. If heart rate was not going to lower, I was planning on going to the ER. 1/9/21 10am till next day. Heart rate was then under 100bpm. I was then so tired that I slept all day and did not eat anything else.  1/10 I experienced severe body aches, chills and headache. This was all day. 1/11 I woke up feeling mildly nauseous for about 3 hours and then dizzy for about an hour. after that I just had a sore arm. 1/12 Had a mildly sore arm.

I could not sleep that night after I received my vaccine. I decided not to go the ER and slept it off I woke up much better next morning. I saw a Doctor a couple of days later because I had shortness of breathing and a high heart rate while I was at work. He just told me to take it slowly at work. No meds.  I then started working part-time for some weeks and am being introduced again now to my regular scheduled.

Didn&#39;t realize it was a fever until 5am when  woke up more, temperature taken at that time was 100.6. Fever stayed all day until 2000, no less than 99.0 even with Tylenol and ibuprofen until that time. Also developed body/muscle aches around 1200 on 07Jan2021, and some nausea. Got sent home from work that day. On 08Jan21 patient synced my (brand withheld) and checked my heart rate for day before.

Also on 08Jan2021 no more fever, but whole right arm is in pain and have a swollen lymph node around right clavicle area. Pain with minor touch to clavicle and upper arm (at site of injection).

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm on unspecified date at a single dose (2nd dose) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Physician stated, &#34;she had no medical conditions, she was in very good you know very like standing with herself.&#34; Patient had her 1st dose of Covid vaccine on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Physician (reporter) stated, &#34;I am the parent of someone who got the COVID dose, the second dose yesterday. I am very concerned because my daughter yesterday (08Jan2021) started to have symptoms and fainted at 4:00 in the morning and hit her nose and has a scar now. She had her second dose yesterday (pending clarification), after the second dose last night she started to feel unwell, getting chills, nausea and when she got up to go to the bathroom, she fainted, she blacked out. She lives alone, she is an adult, she hit her nose, got the scar in the nose, and the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop, she was bleeding from that scar. She told me it took two hours for bleeding to stop from that scar.&#34; When asked when the events started, Physician stated, &#34;Last night (08Jan2021), at 4:00 am she took the shot during the day while she was at work. She said, she started to getting chills and then she was nauseated.&#34; When asked if patient was still experiencing the event, the parent reported no as patient was just resting. Also stated, &#34;She didn&#39;t take any treatment but she said she took Tylenol.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;I am concerned, we are going to be taking her to the urgent care now but I am concerned about what is going on with platelets and all of that because of what had happened, last night the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop for two hours and she was alone at the night and weekends. She said, she had to lay down and then her dad is there now because he is closer, he is going to be taking care of the urgent care but I want Pfizer to know what my daughter has gone through last night after she took this second dose.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;she is having a rash in her arm, she had little red in her bumps as well. I want her to go get checked up as soon as possible in urgent care.&#34; Patient was taking some Ibuprofen (later clarified that patient took Tylenol as treatment). She was not taking any other medication. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information Requested on Lot/ Batch number.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported faint was most likely due to an accident, and less likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                Sharp, non-radiating chest pain at xiphoid process 10/10 pain worse with inspiration, better with exhalation, unable to lay down, lasting 1.5hours, finally resolved with tylenol and motrin. Two separate instances of this pain, one on 1/18/21 at 1600-1730, and one on 1/18/21 2230-0000.  The second instance the pain was so severe, lead to nausea and one episode of emesis. Initially trialed treatment with antacids but that did nothing to improve the pain. Evaluation by MD on 1/19 at 1300 diagnosed with pleuritic pain secondary to inflammation. No prior history of this, no cardiac history, and no history of GERD.  Other post vaccination symptoms included fever approx 10 hours following the vaccine, nausea, one episode of diarrhea, fatigue, body achs, dizziness, and chills, all of which resolved by 1/18 at 1100am.

                                                I felt q lump in my throat and tingly in hands qnd feet for a few minutes after. I then was speaking with management and felt faint and short of breath, continued to be tingly.  Last night 1/19/21 I had a moment of not feeling well and my heart rate went from 60s to 120s with shortness of breath and nausea qnd tingling. This continued for about 30 minutes, I was debating going to the ED for the SOB. I then became really cold and had such bad shaking I couldn&#39;t hold anything for another 20 minutes.  Today I continue to have some tingling. All of this on top of the expected side effects.

                                                Upon receiving my first shot, I felt weak, and after a few days a tingly feeling in my head. Symptoms lasted for 2 weeks. After receiving the second dose, I had a fever that evening and weakness, it lasted through the next day. My right arm was sore for 2 days.  I took Advil, Tylenol, and ibuprofen (at different times). Symptoms of fever lasted two days and were gone, I was left feeling weak, it lasted for a day.  Now day 5 after I got my shot (got the last dose 1/22/2021), I have noticed some vaginal bleeding that has been going on for 2 days now (It&#39;s not the menstrual period since I had that going on a week before I got my last shot). I am wondering if there are any other women who have experienced the same reaction to their body. Kindly feel free to call me or email me with any answers. I am trying to reach my primary physician who is currently booked till February.

On Jan. 21st, 2021, I woke up feeling feverish.  I went to use the bathroom, and after washing my hands I walked towards the bathroom door and felt light-headed and dizzy.  Suddenly, I passed out and hit my head and upper neck on the tile floor.  My parents heard the sound of my fall and luckily rushed to the bathroom.  They found me lying  unconscious on the floor with my eyes rolled up for what felt like more than a minute.  I regained consciousness on my own, and I drank water with a bit of sugar and salt mixed in.    I felt too weak to get up and walk, and the back of my head and upper neck were in pain.  I told my parents to call 911 as I wanted to make sure that there was no serious damage to my brain or neck area.  I went to the local hospital in an ambulance.  I was taken to the emergency room: Vitals were done and my temperature ranged from then was 99.5-101F and my heart rate was high- it stayed around 112 bpm for some time I was given 2 L of IV Saline Fluids EKG result: no clinical abnormalities CT head/neck/spine: negative 2 different types of COVID-19 tests: results were both negative Bloodwork: CBC/BMP/D-dimer: no clinical abnormalities Chest Xray: negative 2D- doppler ultrasound: negative Holter monitor: negative for irregular heart rhythm I was discharged the same day around 4:30pm

                                                I got the 1st Pfizer vaccine on 1/6/21, I had mild itching and fleeting chills after the shot. I took some Benadryl when I got home, and I was ok. I got the 2nd vaccine on 1/27/20 at 8 am. At around 8:10 I started getting itchy. The itching escalated, and I notified one of the nurses at the vaccination clinic. At around 8:32 they administer Claritin and called the rapid response team because I started having tightness in my chest (similar to my asthma reaction). The Physician who responded to the rapid response recommended that I be transferred to the ER for observation. I was taken to the ER and was given IV fluids with Solu-Medrol, Pepcid, and Benadryl. I had some improvement, but still experienced some mild itching, which is still ongoing (as of today 1/31/21 @ 01:47). I?ve had a headache and fatigue the past 2 days, the headache has resolved, but still feeling fatigued. I was prescribed prednisone and I am to take Benadryl as needed. I have been compliant with all my prescribed meds. I had a follow up with my PCP on 1/28/21 @ 8:10, she recommended that I continue taking the medications prescribed in the ER, and to follow up with the office for further assistance or go back to the ER if I have tightness in my chest. She also recommended taking Tylenol for the headache. As of this morning (1/31/21 02:05), I have not had tightness in my chest. I&#39;ve been using my prescribed Inhalers (both the flovent and albuterol).

They began within an hour after I received my second dose but did not occur during the period; I was asked to stay at the Hospital for monitoring. I did not receive Heart palpitations after my first dose. These palpitations were extremely brief; lasting about 1-2 seconds and occurred spontaneously throughout the day. They occurred multiple times throughout the day (up to 20 times). I had an EKG done showing no concerning results. These palpitations stopped after a week and I have not had any since 1/15/21. I did not get lightheaded or nauseas from these palpitations. They were strong enough to notice but did not have a negative impact on my day-to-day activities.

                                                After the vaccine was administered, 5-10 minutes later I began to feel a rapid heart rate. One of the nurses came to check on me, I described to her my symptoms, and she let me know if they get worse to inform her. In the next 5 minutes, my head began to hurt, as well as, some chest pain. She checked on me again, and said to let her know if things got worse. Within the next 5-10 minutes after, I had difficulty swallowing and speaking. I raised my hand, and the nurse came over, then proceeded to get help. They then took my blood pressure and heart rate. My blood pressure was 185/103 and I believe my pulse was 156 bpm. I was still having a hard time swallowing and speaking. They proceeded to get an epi pen and the doctor on site, as well as suggested to send me over the ER/ call 911. The doctor checked my lungs, and they noticed my blood pressure and heart rate was not decreasing to a normal level. I was then put in a wheel chair and transferred to the ER. At the ER, my blood pressure and heart rate was still elevated, as well as difficulty swallowing. The doctor ordered Benadryl via IV, steroids, and the epi pen. After having a reaction to the Benadryl, the epi pen was put on hold. After about 15 minutes, I began to feel better. I was put on IV fluids and observation. I was able to leave the ER around 12 pm 2/05/21. At this time,  7:22 pm, I am feeling better with mild muscle aches, and fatigue.

She was then walked out to the waiting room to wait her 15-20 minutes that is strongly recommended after receiving the vaccine.  Approximately 5 minutes later, she alerted the reception staff that she was having some sort of reaction.  I was then notified immediately and patient was brought back to a private exam area.  Patient complained of chest tightness, numbness in fingers and a racing heartbeat.  She also felt that she was having difficulty breathing.  Vital signs at that time were 96.3 temperature, RR 36, blood pressure 170/100 and a heart rate of 174.  Patient received (1) epipen  and 911 was simultaneously notified.   2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula were applied.  Shortly after epipen was given and oxygen applied, patients heartrate decreased into the 130s.  Oxygen remained stable at 99-100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Ice pack applied to base of neck for comfort.  EMS arrived and report given as patient will be taken to the emergency department for further evaluation.

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after receiving my vaccine I felt warmth down injected arm. Approximately 20 minutes post injection, I experienced a drop in my blood pressure, heaviness in my legs (like walking through cement), and ringing in my ears. At approximately 12:30-12:45pm I experienced mental fog (I couldn&#39;t remember how to turn off my windshield wipers), increased heart rate, rapid onset of feelings of panic, minor shortness of breath, neck/clavicle tightness on side of injection, and sweating. Between approximately 1:30pm and 2:30pm I continued to have extreme sweating, as well as: increased pulse, fatigue, dry throat, muscle weakness/shakiness, brain fog, and headache. At approximately 3:30 I hit my knee on the bed frame and felt like the wind had been knocked out of me and immediately had a severe drop in blood pressure that felt similar to a vasovagal event. I called the vaccine clinic and my symptoms were noted and I was told to seek help if my symptoms worsened or I felt like I was going to pass out. My symptoms have not worsened but I am still experiencing extreme sweating along with shivering, shakiness, blood pressure changes with movement (orthostatic hypotension), and fatigue - time is currently 5:50pm

                                                minutes after administration, patient reports head feeling strange, so I asked her to remain seated so I can observe her prior to getting up to the observation room. Then she reports feeling nauseous and weak. I asked her what medical conditions she has and she told me she is diabetic and has kidney disease. I asked if she ate breakfast, she said she did not, only had something small before heading out in the morning. I gave her am ice pack to place on the back of her neck which helped relieve her symptoms of head feeling strange and the nausea. Once nurse arrived, we checked her pulse and blood pressure, at this time it was around 11:45 am and her pulse was low at 64 and blood pressure at 94/60, which patient states is her baseline normal blood pressure. We opened the windows so she could get some fresh air since the room was very hot and shortly after we took her pulse and blood pressure she seemed to be feeling better. By 11:50 am the ambulance arrived and paramedics asked if she would like to be taken to the hospital to get checked, she said even though she is feeling a lot better, she would prefer to go just in case.

The first dose of bnt162b2 was taken on 17Dec2020. The patient&#39;s medical history included bipolar disorder. Concomitant medications included quetiapine (QUETIAPINE). The patient experienced some kind of back pain, behind her heart, heart pain and pretty strong chest pain on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered. In addition experienced &#34;fatigue caused by the vaccine was so profound that was advised to not take her bipolar medication, quetiapine&#34; on an unspecified date with outcome of recovered. It was reported that &#34;It took 36 hours for the extreme fatigue to stop. This was very frightening because being without the medication could cause auditory hallucinations to return after 36 hours. There should be a warning for people who must take sedative medication regularly so that they can make an informed decision about whether or not to receive the vaccine&#34;.

Side effects began 2 days after her 2nd COVID vaccine. Pt was transferred to hospital from another institution due to O2 sat in the 60s (room air), leukocytosis, and AKI. Patient was treated empirically for sepsis/pneumonia as well as lupus flare. She was also initiated on high dose steroids. Possible reaction to vaccine. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and no signs of pulmonary embolism. Pt was transferred from hospital to another facility given progressive organ failure, most specifically liver failure.

                                                In the week following my vaccination, I presented no symptoms. After day 7, I developed soreness/tenderness in my left armpit and a series of neurological symptoms that are very concerning including depression, anxiety, insomnia (accompanied with heart racing, sweating, tingling in extremities, obsessive thoughts etc). Although, I have had sleep issues during the course of the pandemic, I do not deal with daily anxiety. I very rarely have to turn to any medication and especially have not had any  anxiety symptoms or sleep issues recently.   I do not believe the CDC has commented on the connection between vaccine safety and any relationship between vaccine immune response and neuropsychiatric disorders. Or how antibodies produced via vaccine react to other proteins.  My daily activities have been significantly impacted over the course of this week.  I would appreciate learning if there is possible cross-reactivity and if that has presented in other adults.

I drank water and remained at the site for another 30 minutes and my vitals were checked again before I left.

Did not work. EMT loaded me on the stretcher out of my car in the ambulance. Gave albuterol mix in nebulizer. Went into full anaphylaxis on the way to ER. 4 epi in the arm did not help 2 benedrylmshits to the arm did not help. I was on 5L oxygen until the epi was mixed with albuterol to pen airways. Anaphylactic episodes continued every 5 hours for 2 days, then became every 12 hours, then 24 hours, then 12 hours. Steroids, Claritin, antacid, albuterol epi mix have helped managed episodes. Still currently in the hospital.

                                                Everything started on January 24th at about 7pm exactly 20 days post first Pfizer vaccine. No other changes or vaccines given since October (flu vaccine) was scheduled for 1/25/21 for second Pfizer dose. It all started when I was working at ER when I started to feel cold like it was in an ice bath and numbness in both feet. I went to discharge my patients when I realized ascending numbness and coldness from the feet was traveling upward. Within 5 hours (around midnight) I went to hospital due to having severe weakness to where I couldn?t walk and loss of bladder control. I was rushed to MRI of brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. I also had blood work done and a lumbar puncture. I was admitted for a couple days to watching the ascending weakness and loss of feeling. My MRIs came back clear from any diseases such as transverse myelitis, MS, etc. My LP showed mild elevated protein at 54 (normal range 15-45), one tube elevated lymphocytes 100% (range 40-80%) and one tube elevated monocytes 50% (range 15-45%). Also CK-MB w/reflex was 352 (range 26-140). I was discharged on 2/26 at 5:30pm with a diagnosis of bilateral leg weakness and numbness. From this point on I was wheelchair bound at home and being cared for 24/7. After discharge some additional random symptoms started such as chills with no fever to where I slept in sweat pants and sweat shirts, leg spasms/ twitches, leg heaviness, severe lower back and hip pain, a loss of sensation while going pee or poo but not incontinent, and things like drop foot with the severe weakness and numbness . On 2/3/22 I started with double vision, blurry vision and pain behind my right eye. I went to ER and had repeat MRIs of brain, cervical, thoracic and lumbar with and without contrast and basic blood work and was sent home to follow up with Dr. on 2/9 and was discharged home. By 2/8 my strength started to get worse to where I couldn?t lift my kids. Finally saw Dr. neurology and MS specialist 2/9, he ran detailed neuro exams from head to toe, looked at both scans from both hospitals, all the blood work and LP results. He reported that I had severe hyper reflexes in both legs and Hoffman?s sign in both hands. My feet were completely numb and cold to where I couldn?t feel them or walk. Literally felt like everyday I was standing in a ice cold bath with no feeling of touch hot or cold sensation or pin pricks. He realized my loss of sensation was from my bra line down and included tingling in my hands and weakness in my arms. I was able to get up for the first time with a walker and take a few steps with assistance at this time. He then sent me to ER to be admitted and see their neuromuscular team to get further treatment. Upon arrival via wheelchair I was brought back to see the ER Doctor and re-did a neuro exam, some blood work and contacted the neurology team to come see me. I was then admitted to the hospital step down ICU under Dr with strict monitoring. On 2/10/21 The neuro team ordered another set of MRI of brain, cervical and thoracic with and without contrast due to a change in condition again since my last visit to hospital. They reviewed and compared studies with no changes. They scheduled me for MRI lumbar on 2/11/21 with and without contrast which came back no changes from previous MRI as well as another LP which everything that was off before was now normal. Everyday I would work with PT, OT and speech. I had no changes in speech and slowly got some strength back, and was able walk using a walker. I was then discharged home on 2/13 mid afternoon and was told I would do home health and follow up with their neurologist and Neuromusclar team once everything was resulted back. On 2/19/21 I saw my primary doctors office (nurse practitioner) where she checked up on the status of me, took me officially off work and on state disability, filled out paperwork for work and a handicapped pass. On 2/25/21 followed up with neurology, and discussed all my imaging and blood work. All CSF fluid came back normal, all labs were fine and wanted me to get an EMG to look for nerve damage. She also wanted a follow up with cardiology as my resting heart rate was 110-120 and would spike to 160s. On 3/1/21 Home health was started for physical therapy for strengthening and working on sensation for both legs. At this point I had almost full strength in my arms, still tingling in my hands and constant numbness and cold feeling in both feet and knees with severe sensitivity to cold, wind or touch on my legs. I had Home health twice a week every week for 2-3 weeks then started outpatient physical therapy which has been twice a week for 1.5 hours. On 3/5 I saw cardiology and was placed on a holt monitor for 48 hour monitoring. On 3/9 I had my EMG with Dr. and had a follow up with Dr. for 35 tubes of blood he had drawn for multiple diseases which both blood work and EMG came back negative. On 3/16 symptoms started to change from numbness to severe hypersensitivity to touch, severe shooting nerve pains, burning sensations, non stop tingling in hands, issues with temperatures either hot or cold, and swelling of both legs. On 3/17 I saw rheumatology that looked into everything said it was not lupus related as none of my inflammatory markers or lupus DNA strands were elevated and no lupus symptoms like rashes, ulcers in the mouth or tongue, hair loss or joint pain. He ordered more blood work and confirmed it was not a lupus flare up. He suggested doing a small nerve fiber biopsies. On 3/19/21 saw spinal orthopedics who reassured it has nothing to do with my spine, prescribed gabapentin for all the nerve pain and told me that neurology is who should be following me. On 3/26 I had an echocardiogram done due to the leg swelling and heart rates which came back negative for any heart problems and was told since the tachycardia is getting better to just continue watching it and was prescribed trazodone 25mg to help with sleep due to severe nerve pains, spasms and severe back and hip pains at night. On 4/1/21 was followed up again with neurology. Ordered small nerve fiber biopsy for may 18th, increased the gabapentin to 300 mg- 3 times a day and had me wean off cymbalta. I am still dealing with tingling, burning hot and cold sensitivities in both legs, still tingling in hands all day but strength is back to full. I am scheduled to hopefully return to work 5/30/2021 after being off since 1/24/2021.

A 29-years-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EP7534), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Mar2021 09:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient was 29 year old at the time of vaccination. Medical history included asthma, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, peanut and treenut allergy, all from an unknown date. Patient had estrogen allergy. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 Prior to or after the vaccination. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY), medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO PROGESTIN), beclometasone dipropionate (QVAR), OMEPRAZOLE, SERTRALINE HYDROCHLORIDE, all taken on an unspecified date and for unknown indication. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient had her first dose of bnt162b2 on 04Mar20210 at 9:45 am in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. On 28Mar2021 at 09:45 the patient was diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. She had a horrible headache after intercourse, went to the ER after vomiting, and had a CT scan that revealed the clot. The patient was hospitalized for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram: revealed the clot. Patient received Heparin and Eliquis as treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as no. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccine. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes omeprazole, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (MARLISSA), venlafaxine and gabapentin from unspecified dates, received within 2 weeks of vaccination, for unspecified indication. Patient historically took first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 (Lot number: EN6204) on 13Mar2021 at 11:00 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient previously took hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN) on an unspecified date and indication and had allergy. On 02Apr2021, around 10pm, patient began having chills and extreme muscle pain and spasms, and the lymph nodes in her left armpit swelled up so much that she couldn&#39;t put her arm down without extreme pain.  By midnight (03Apr2021 00:00), patient had a fever and was unable to stand unassisted. She was writhing in pain and arching uncontrollably off the bed.  She believed in hindsight that this was a seizure as she went in and out of consciousness and her tongue swelled up, making it hard to breathe and impossible to speak. She was sweating profusely, and had to drink water constantly.  Her husband had to help her get to the bathroom because she couldn&#39;t support her own body without tipping over.  The chills and fever alternated all night, and she finally passed out from exhaustion at 03Apr2021 at 7am. The next 2 days, she was in a cycle of fever and chills again, and the fever got so bad that she seized twice more on Saturday (03Apr2021).  She had to take the day off work on Monday (05Apr2021) as she was still in so much pain that she could barely leave bed except to use the bathroom. Events were reported as life-threatening, immediate risk of death from the events. Patient was not hospitalized. Treatment for the adverse events were cool baths, naproxen (ALEVE) for fever and pain, and PEDIALYTE. COVID-19 was not tested post vaccination. Vaccination facility type was at a hospital. The outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

This healthcare professional reported information for both mother and fetus/baby. This is a mother (patient) report.  A 29-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), first dose (batch: EL9262) on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 29-years-old) then second dose (lot: EN6201) on 18Feb2021 (at the age of 29-years-old); both via an unspecified route of administration as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included blood clot (during her previous pregnancy); pulmonary embolism (during her previous pregnancy) and pregnancies (previous pregnancies were kind of close together). Concomitant medication included enoxaparin sodium (LOVENOX) for blood clot prophylaxis/pulmonary embolism prophylaxis (patient had a blood clot, a pulmonary embolism, during her previous pregnancy and so they make her prophylactically take it, always has been on it. The patient had a blood clot and was breastfeeding so she did enoxaparin sodium and she got pregnant again and was still on enoxaparin sodium). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 on 22Jan2021, and the second dose on 18Feb2021. She was pregnant at the time, subsequently developed pre-eclampsia on 22Mar2021, and delivered on 25Mar2021, 7 weeks before her due date. The patient&#39;s seriousness for preeclampsia was hospitalization from 22Mar2021 to 28Mar2021 and life threatening. The patient stated that they delivered the baby and the overall preeclampsia has resolved. The patient&#39;s blood pressure remains somewhat elevated and heart rate was severe, intermittently in Mar2021 with seriousness of medically significant and hospitalization from 22Mar2021 to 28Mar2021. The patient had a doctor appointment at a maternal fetal medicine on 22Mar2021 then from there she was delivered because her blood pressure and heart rates continued to worsen. The patient still has increased blood pressure, but she never had any blood pressure issues, just mild. The patient&#39;s blood pressure remained somewhat elevated and heart rate remained very elevated, but she couldn&#39;t say there was still protein in the urine (in 2021). The patient stated that her heart rate and blood pressure improved, and were medically significant. The patient remained on the dose and then her heart rate went up, not her blood pressure, just her heart rate went up really high starting in February, beginning of March and they increased her dose to, maybe in March, beginning of March, her heart rate went up, had her on enoxaparin sodium at 100mg once daily as her prophylactic dose and changed and went up from that to 100mg twice daily by injection. The patient stated that she may have weighed a little more (in 2021). The last weight was with pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. The patient weighed 205 (unspecified date). The patient was pregnant so she was seeing more of her maternal/fetal medicine and OB, but had seen her primary care throughout, maybe once. The patient stated that they didn&#39;t have enough data on pregnancy and neonatal and she wanted to contribute and advance knowledge in her area by providing information. The patient got the vaccination just on her own, just wanted to protect herself and her baby, the benefits outweighed the risks so she proceeded to get the vaccine. The outcome of the events blood pressure increased and heart rate abnormal was recovered in 2021; for pre-eclampsia was recovered with sequel on 25Mar2021 while for the remaining events was unknown. The patient did not believe the pre eclampsia had anything to do with the vaccine. The patient was not indicating that the vaccination led to the pre-eclampsia, that&#39;s for Pfizer to determine.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the events Pre-eclampsia, Blood pressure increased, and Heart rate increased are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.

A 29-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: PAA165969, expiry date not reported), intramuscular, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 10:30 as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if patient had known allergies or other medical history. It was unknown if patient had Covid prior vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the vaccination and report. It was unknown if patient received other vaccine in four weeks and other medications in two weeks. The patient received the vaccine at the doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient fainted five minutes after the vaccination on 07Apr2021 10:30. She was pale and diaphoretic. She became responsive within one minute. She was given water and a cold compress, and reported she felt better, but then vomited a small amount of emesis 15 minutes later (07Apr2021). She was evaluated by the physician who determined it was an emotional response to the vaccine. The patient had reported she was extremely anxious about receiving the vaccine (07Apr2021), and had fainted when she tried to give blood, and hadn&#39;t eaten anything that day. After sitting for 45 minutes, the doctor felt comfortable letting her leave. A call was placed to the patient at 4:00 pm to check on her. She reported she felt fine. The patient received no treatment for the event vomited, while therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the other reported events. It was unknown if patient was tested for Covid post vaccination. The patient recovered on an unspecified date in 2021 from the events reported.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available and a close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events of syncope.

Feber has subsided.  Cough, shortness of breath and intermittent wheezing remain as well as some chest pressure, sore throat, headache and chills. Coughing fits are bad enough to cause urinary incontinence but I did give birth 4 months ago so this may not be significant. No signs of allergic reactive such as redness, urticaria or swelling.

This A 30-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EH9899), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 22Dec2020 09:00 for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included reaction to pork, porsine and/or if she ever was exposed to exposed to heparin. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced syncope (medically significant), dizziness (medically significant), feeling faint; like going to pass out now and then (medically significant), overall achiness, severe headaches, fever. The outcome of the events syncope, dizziness, feeling faint; like going to pass out now was recovering and outcome of overall achiness, severe headaches, fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The patient ask: are there any animal products, pork gelatin or a lipid form of that contain in the vaccine?   The events were described as follows: She experienced a significant amount of syncope and dizziness, for greater than 4 or 5 days post-receiving the vaccination. Also feeling faint like she is going to pass out every now and then. Has a more important question, wondering along with the doctors if one of the ingredients may have an animal product, like pork gelatin or a lipid form of that. It looks like one of the ingredients may have an animal cell lipid and was wondering if she was having a reaction to that. Declines to provide primary care provider details. States she received this first dose at occupational health in her workplace. Received the vaccine on the 22Dec2020 at 9am. 24 hours post vaccination, 1 day after, the syncope, dizziness, feeling faint started. Also the other symptoms, overall achiness, severe headaches, and fever were also experienced, but they stopped after that 24 hours. Those were expected since it was listed as side effects that popped up, so she expected those and they stopped after 24 hours. The syncope, dizziness, and faint feeling are not any worse and are very slowly improving, but she still has it and had to call out of work today because of it. That&#39;s consistent. Mentions it takes her a while to get down the stairs when getting product details for the COVID-19 vaccine. Unable to provide the vaccine NDC or expiry, or dose. Did not have any other vaccines at time of this one and none 4 weeks prior. Had to call a (company withheld) doctor and has to go to occupational health tomorrow to be seen. Declines having COVID virus. No further details provided.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events syncope and dizziness are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

After receiving the vaccine we had her stay in the room directly in front of us for 30 minutes so we could monitor her. It was noted she seemed to be having difficulty breathing &amp; at that point we administered the first epinephrine 0.3mg dose. She reported feeling better &amp; her color got better. We continued to closely monitor her &amp; in approximately 7 to 8 minutes her breathing became labored again. A second epinephrine 0.3mg dose was administered &amp; we called to have her transported to the hospital.

                                                Within seconds of vaccine administration, I felt flushing of my upper and lower extremities as well as muffling in my right ear. My hands and feet became clammy. A small fan helped subside symptoms momentarily. Within minutes my lower extremities became shaky. I developed chills and felt faint. VS were measured. I was hypertensive (BP 134/100, baseline BP usually runs 110/80s). I developed intermittent tachycardic and heart palpitations, with a max HR of 124. Symptoms lasted approximately 1hour post vaccine administration.  I work at a COVID testing site, chances of me being exposed to COVID-19 are high. I was not tested prior to receiving either dose of the vaccine; however, I have remained asymptomatic for the duration of the series.

A currently 31-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, at the age of 30-years, on an unspecified date at a single dose as COVID-19 vaccine. Medical history/concurrent conditions included positive ANA; ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder); known allergies to sulfa drugs and mangoes. Concomitant medications included methylprednisolone (MEDROL), ibuprofen, and baclofen (received other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination). She was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was vaccinated in a hospital (facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered). She did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced sleep paralysis 2 days after vaccine associated with tachycardia on unspecified dates. The events were non-serious which did not result in death, not life threatening, did not caused/prolonged hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating, did not cause congenital anomaly/birth defect. She was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and did not have Covid tested post vaccination (had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination). Treatment was not received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                At 4:10 I awoke with pruritus and when i looked at my arms and I developed hives on my bilateral  forearms and bilateral hip area.  I felt itchy all over.  When I stood up, I felt palpitations and started to feel as if I was going to pass out.  I sat down and I started to tremor and felt like it was hard to catch my breath.  I took an antihistamine and took a puff of albuterol.  I felt a lot better. At 10 AM in the morning, the hives have improved but i still feel some pruritus.

Patient walked out of the vaccination room after her 15 minutes observation period and did not complain of any symptoms. She walked to the main entrance and notified a clinic manager at the check-in desk that she was experiencing &#34;chest pain.&#34; Clinic RNs came to observe and assess the patient. The patient communicated with no displays of distress. When asked what type of chest pain, she stated &#34;heaviness pressing on her chest, localized on the left side and on the upper chest area.&#34; Patient denied pain radiating down arm and denied jaw pain. Patient denied SOB and had no signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. She was escorted to the ED via wheelchair at 18:33. The ED note states that symptoms were most likely related to anxiety (patient mentioned she was anxious about receiving her second dose) and as patient reported symptoms completely resolved, she was discharged home from the ED at 19:01.

Around 2:30am felt pressure and warmth (coming in waves) up towards my chest, lasting 1-2 seconds and occurring about every 5 minutes . Was able to withstand feeling until it became difficult to breath. Lips and face turned white and blue, fainted. Felt extremely nausea when awake.  Called 911. Vitals were normal apart from BP was very high 130/100&#39;s. EKG was NSR. Blood sugar taken was normal around 113. After 1 hour of event, I took a shower and drank water. I felt the wave one more time before trying to fall asleep. Then stopped. Woke up fine.

Each episode lasts 30-40 mins then subsides and symptoms go away completely. I had 3 episodes of these symptoms the first day and so far 3 the second day. My doctor recommended I go to the emergency room.  Based off my EKG, vitals, and family history there was no reason to believe that the episodes were causing any heart abnormalities.

A 30-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number Ej1685) at a single dose at 09:45 AM 07Jan2021 at left arm for Covid-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient had her first dose of Pifzer Covid-19 vaccine on 21Dec2020 at 12:00 PM at left arm, and experienced very mild reactions which included mild pain at injection site and runny nose/sneezing day after vaccine. The paitent had a medical hisotry of rash to penicillin as a child. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to her first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. In the evening of second vaccine (around 17:00), pain and stiffness radiated from injection site all the way down arm, into breast, and middle of back. She started having chills. Around 10 hours after dose chills became somewhat violent despite being under 4 blankets. Severe headache also started. In the middle of the night to go to bathroom, she collapsed on the way back and was unable to get up for about 20 minutes. She also suffered from tachycardia overnight. her baseline heart rate runs in 60s- 70s, but was in 110s-120s (based on Apple Watch monitoring). Day after vaccine, she was extremely fatigue entire day and spent all but a few hours in bed. Arm pain mostly gone. Headache was very strong and persistent through the day. On second night chills not as bad but still occurred overnight. HR still elevated in 80s overnight. Morning of day 2 still had headache and fatigue. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The outcome of collapse and unable to get up for 20minutes, pain and stiffness radiating from injection site all the way down arm,into breast, and middle of back was resolved, chills and tachycardia was resolving, headache, fatigue was not resolved. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The reporter considered that the events was non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a chronological temporal association and known BNT162B2 vaccine safety profile, causality between events fainting, violent chills and severe headache and BNT162B2 ((Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) cannot be completely excluded. The case will be reevaluated should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I tried to wait it out for a  couple of hours and nothing improved so I went to the ER 12/31/20 and they did EKG and other tests. They medicated me with Ibuprofen and sent me home. The next day I had to go again because the pains were worse. At the ER at 01/01/2021 they redid the same tests and all came back normal. I still feel the chest pains not as strong they come and go. I had them yesterday but not today. My PCP does not know what to do and prescribed me XANAX to keep me from getting stressed and making it to come back. My employer suggested doing a COVID test but I had not had a chance to go and have it done yet.

                                                My first reaction after the second dose of Pfizer vaccine was numb right arm immediately after the injection. This was followed by a feeling of shakiness and cold sweating. After about 20 minutes my heart started racing and hives/rash on neck and chest. After about 30 minutes of observation I was told to go straight to urgent care. I went to Accelerated Urgent Care.  I received a shot of I believe Dexamethasone and was prescribed prednisone. Throughout the weekend following the injection on Friday I have felt tired and have had moderate diarrhea and feelings of being flushed.

After three hours they discharged me . I felt  Tachycardia for about two days after. After the 2-3 day I felt better.  I had another Tachycardia episode  on January 25,2021- I was scheduled to get my second dose but didn&#39;t get it done.  It just hit me and my heart rate went up, it has not gone away and have been dealing with it for about two weeks. I have a heart monitor on me.  I saw a Gastrologist and they want to do an EGD to rule out ulcers.  I&#39;m not able to eat without feeling a hot rush and my heart rate going up.  I have lost 12lbs since the 20th.

                                                Approximately 12 days after vaccination co began to have fatigue, weakness, Pancytopenia      Recent hospitalization which involved initial presentation at hospital on AK 12/29, and then again on 12/30, after eval on 12/30 was then transferred to another hospital, and later transferred where she later recovered and was discharged.      She was initially very ill and was thought to have sepsis due to fever/initial presentation/clinical picture, also had lab abnormalities including thrombocytopenia.  These things necessitated transfer.  While at hospital, hematology was consulted.  Decision was made to transfer due to concern for DIC/possibility of leukemia. Also there was concern for C Diff, treatment was given for this.  While in hospital, she underwent further testing on blood samples which revealed no evidence for malignancy, also bone marrow biopsy was performed.  While there, DIC labs were trended/began to improve.  Discharged on 1/5/21.  Had f/u with hematology @ hospital on 1/12/21.  No reason has been found as of yet as to why she became ill.  Per discharge note it&#39;s thought it could have been viral in nature, or possibly related to supplement use.  Will f/u with heme in early Feb.   Of note, she does report getting her first dose of pfizer covid vaccine on 12/17/20, she reports concern that this could have played a part in her illness.  She states this was the only new/out of the ordinary thing that she can remember recently, regarding her medical hx, prior to recent acute illness/hospitalization. Requests I reach out to inquire how she can file a report with Pfizer or CDC

The whole body ache was almost gone but her back was still in pain and her blood pressure dropped with random dizziness when she was walking or standing up. The next morning (13Feb2021), the back pain was gone and she felt it back to normal except for a little random dizziness in movement. She did not take any medication to alleviate the adverse effects during the timeline. The patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The patient recovered from back pain in 13Feb2021, the patient recovered from the remaining events in Feb2021.

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient had a syncopal event preceded by nausea and lightheadedness. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive (67/37).  EKG (3/12): Sinus brady, rate 46 bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG (3/12): 89mg/dl. EMS administered 500mL IV saline. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient feels back at baseline and was normotensive (119/72). Patient stated they have a history of vasovagal response and vasovagal vomiting, but had never experienced a vasovagal syncope episode. Physician administered 0.5mg Lorazepam. The ED physician admitted the patient to the telemetry unit for vasovagal syncope due to patient&#39;s prodrome and prior history of similar near syncopal episodes. Inpatient attending agreed that the patient&#39;s vasovagal response may be secondary to poor PO intake with extreme stress. Patient&#39;s admission was less than 1-day and stated they were anxious to return home. Discharged with diagnoses of Mild leukocytosis, Vasovagal response, and Orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration.

                                                1022 - Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccine by RN.  She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient. Ambulance in route, about 5 - 10 minutes out per radio communication.  Checking BP every 2  minutes.  Now is 68/44. C/O nausea and vomited. Pulse ox won?t pick up.  Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

                                                Vaginal bleeding/irregular bleeding; bloody noses; spotting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient).  This  30-years-old female patient received at hospital bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1  administered in Arm Left on 17Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9809) as SINGLE DOSE, and dose 2 on 07Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) administered in Arm Left  as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination 30 years. Medical history included ongoing spotting (she has had her tubes tied in the past /She continued to have spotting even after the period was over). The patient got 1st dose on 17Feb2021 and developed Vaginal bleeding, bloody noses.  She said she was having a period every 2 weeks, and &#34;spotting&#34; every other day. The she got 2nd dose on 07Mar2021, and experienced nose is bleeding and vaginal bleeding again.Then it was added she completed both; and keeps having irregular bleeding. she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination 17Feb2021 at an unknown time in the left arm. On that day she noticed irregular bleeding, spotting. Mentioned she has had her tubes tied in the past and so she called her gynecologist who made an appointment for her. Then she got her regular period two weeks later to she cancelled that appointment. She continued to have spotting even after the period was over. She mentioned this to her gynecologist twice and he said to wait and see. She received the second dose 07Mar2021 at 16:50 PM in the left arm. She noticed today on 10Mar2021 she was having vaginal bleeding and spotting with bright red blood and also a nose bleed. Mentioned she also noticed blood with sex. She was concerned and plans to contact her HCP next because her brother had osteosarcoma at 16 years old  and she has a cousin who had thrombocytopenia. Seriousness criteria provided -Other medically important conditions. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it is unlikely  that the reported &#34;vaginal bleeding, spotting with bright red blood and nose bleed&#34; were due to bnt162b2.  These are probably intercurrent medical conditions.  Case will be reassessed of additional information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had my first dose of Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine on the 5th of April, 2021 at 1pm. I had sore arm and was fatigued which was expected. However, the day I had my vaccine was also the day my menstrual cycle started and just to assure myself I informed the pharmacist and asked if that was okay and they said it shouldn?t be a concern.   I was doing fine until toward the end of day 3. I was expecting my period to stop as it always does on 3rd day  but I started bleeding heavier that day there after. It didn?t worry me much until I started discharging huge blood clots  as big as an apple 2 times every after 30 mins from that moment.   I rushed to the ER later that night(still bleeding heavily with blood clots every now and then) but I was not admitted since my vitals and the blood counts were normal at that moment.   I went back home  and hoped the bleeding would stop but again with on pain or fever what so ever I kept bleeding all day. This is my 5th day of bleeding. Then on Sunday morning, I still kept bleeding heavy and I was too weak that I went back to the ER again.   This time , (day 6) I got admitted because I have had lost a lot of blood and I needed blood transfusion. My HB dropped from 11.3 to 6.7 and it went further down to 5 something. I got 3 units of blood transfusion in the ER. They did ultrasound, CT scans(with and without contrast) and still couldn?t figure out the cause of the bleeding. My uterus showed no problems but my body was not even responding to Tranexamic acid to stop the bleeding. So the doctor proceeded with an angiogram and did an emergency uterine artery Embolization to stop the blood supply to the uterus. The bleeding stopped there after and I started regaining my vitals.  However, the cause of the bleeding still remains unknown.

A 30-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 06Apr2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0150) as 1st dose, single, at the age of 30-years-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical/family history and concomitant medications. The patient went to go get her second shot of Pfizer covid vaccine but they wouldn&#39;t give it to her based on her reactions to the first dose. They said there was a chance of anaphylaxis reaction to the second shot. The patient reported blacking out, diarrhea, sweating and unable to talk. She consulted with her healthcare professional regarding whether to get the second shot and they didn&#39;t know. She asked if her reactions were normal. She doesn&#39;t know what to do whether to get a second shot given her reaction. It was mentioned that the patient was hard to hear at times. She got the vaccine on 06Apr2021 around noon and she was fine until around 3:30 am. She woke up in horrible pain from head to toe, she thought maybe she just needed to pee, she didn&#39;t know what was going on. She stood up and she blacked out like she was about to faint. She couldn&#39;t see anything, like it was completely black. She got to bathroom and she couldn&#39;t breathe at all, she couldn&#39;t talk. She thought she needs to go to the hospital, but she couldn&#39;t talk. Her face turned green, she had diarrhea, she was like dripping wet. At this point, she could sort of breathe. She felt like she was being held under water, still dripping sweat. She has recovered completely from these symptoms. The severity of symptoms was so severe she doesn&#39;t know if she had a fever at the same time, it was hard to tell. With the breathing part, she was so freaked out by that, so it&#39;s hard to know for sure, maybe yes. She may have had a low fever. She had a fever that night to the point where she was dripping on the floor. She has aching in her legs. She went to the doctor thinking she had Lyme disease, which she doesn&#39;t. Since that vaccine, she&#39;s had very, somewhat severe leg aches and extreme exhaustion like all the time. she can hardly go to work sometimes. Everybody has days they are tired, but this was different. She had to come home at 2pm and lay down for like five hours. She stated it was persisting. She had a blood test recently and everything came back perfect on 26Apr2021. She thought she had Lyme disease because of all the symptoms she was having, and it all came back negative. She didn&#39;t exactly get turned away. They said they didn&#39;t feel comfortable giving her the second dose of vaccine. The patient stated if a nurse tells her they don&#39;t feel comfortable, she wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable until she speaks to Pfizer. The nurse told her she had to go to an allergist and rheumatologist. The nurse said the same thing, the nurse told her that she should have gone to the hospital, but she wasn&#39;t thinking at that moment. She was just at a loss of what to do. That day at the hospital, they were scared with the second vaccine that she could go into anaphylaxis and she&#39;s not sure what to do. The patient had no other vaccines administered on the same date of Pfizer suspect and no other vaccinations within 4 weeks. The event hard to hear at times started on an unknown date while other events started on 07Apr2021 and ended the same day. The outcome of the events aching in her legs and exhaustion was not recovered, hard to hear at times was unknown while for other events was recovered. The events &#34;she blacked out, like she was about to faint&#34; was assessed as serious medically significant.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information expected.

It would come about a min. or two apart. Lasted for 30-45 min. Resolved on it&#39;s own. They transported me to ER. They listened to lungs; did not hear wheezing. My blood pressure was elevated a little initially - 130/90 which is elevated for me. And then it went back down within that 45 time frame. I was monitored there in ER. They wanted to monitor me in the ER so logistical reasons. Did not have rash or light headness. Released after an hour of observation and symptoms had resolved. Then went back to work. The place of vaccination and ER were the same hospital.

I was given 25mg benedryl, which calmed the flushed feeling and I was monitored for about 30 minutes and finally my BP and went back down to around 130/70 and my body normalized out besides the tingling which lasted the remainder of the day.  I had a little nausea.  I went back to work and finished out the day.  I took more benedryl when I got home to help with the tingling feeling which finally deminished after about 24 hrs.

                                                Developed a &#34;scratchy throat approximately 20 minutes post vaccination. Symptoms worsened and she developed shortness of breath. Required evaluation and treatment in the Emergency Department. Received Benadryl, dexamethaxone, famotidine and solumedrol. Second COVID vaccine, no reaction with the first vaccine. ED provider notes below: This patient presented due to concern for allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine and was seen by myself immediately upon arrival.  When in triage the triage nurse noted her oxygen saturation was 81% so she was placed on 2 L nasal cannula and brought directly back to her room.  When placed in the room she was hooked up to the monitor and her oxygen saturation was 100% and I took her off of the nasal cannula and her oxygen saturation remained in the upper 90s.  She had no stridor and respirations were nonlabored.  She was speaking without difficulty and had no vocal changes.  She did not appear to be in any acute distress.  Her posterior oropharynx was widely patent and she had no uvula or tongue swelling or lip swelling.  She did have some blotchiness to the upper chest area but no hives.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.  Pulse was regular.  Blood pressure was stable.  She was nontoxic in appearance.  An IV was established and the patient was given Decadron and Benadryl for initial treatment.

                                                Noticed burning in left forearm immediately after vaccine, within 1 min. Symptoms progressed to feeling hot, flushed, and tachycardia briefly around 5 min. 10 min developed a pressure in my chest, and dizziness. Within 20 min, developed itching, flushing and hives specifically on left arm, hand, and across chest. Within 45 min, both ears and forehead covered with hives. Hospital staff made me go to ED. Within ED hives continued to progress across the chest and bilateral arms and wrists. Received 50mg of Benadryl, and 40mg of prednisone. Symptoms improved but did not resolved. 3 hrs following vaccine, bilateral lip swelling. Took 40mg of percribed pred and 25mg of Benadryl again around 4pm.  Within 12 hrs, significant diarrhea. Hives resurfaced on face, bilateral wrists, arms, and ears around 645 on the 12/29. Fever 100.3 noted on 12/29-12/30. Intermitted hives, and lip swelling remained until 1/1. Nausea diarrhea and body aches until 1/2.

                                                Right after the second dose less than 2 minutes my heart rate began to spike. I could feel my heart pumping fast. I couldn?t sit due to this so I began pacing the room. I didn?t know this was a side affect so I thought I was over thinking the second dose. I attributed this to all the worry and doubt the media and people around me try pumping in your head. I thought I was having a panic attack. I didn?t alert any of the medical team there because again, I thought I was over thinking it. A few hours later my heart rate had gone down. My Apple Watch helped me monitor this. The next day I felt pain at the injection site, not my normal self, groggy. Slightly feverish and chilled. I work in a cold environment so I couldn?t quite tell if the chilled feeling was a side effect, or the room. Later that evening around 9pm things took a turn. I began running a low grade fever and was shaking from being so cold. About another hour late my fever was up to 101 and I was still shaking from being so cold. I took about 600mg of ibuprofen. I couldn?t sleep, tossed and turned. Probably another hour later my temperature was 102, still shaking uncontrollably. Covered in about 5 blankets I kept waiting it out. And I?d say around 2-3am I could feel my fever breaking. By late morning my temp was back to normal but I felt achy still. Tired, sore. Definitely sore at my injection site. And I don?t know if this is worth mentioning or not but just haven?t been able to shake that panic attack feeling. Like a worry or a dread over me. I just don?t feel as clear-headed as I did before. This is my biggest concern. Just don?t feel myself yet.

Onset of severe chills/shaking, fluctuating temperature (no fever), horrible aches and pains, significant fatigue, and persistent headache from about 3am the morning after (on 1/8) and lasting until bedtime that day. The next morning (1/9),  most symptoms had resolved except for fatigue. I also experienced a new sx: severe pain and tightness in my chest/torso; was hard to breath normally and could not take a deep breath without experiencing significant pain. This lasted until about 3pm. Fatigue persisted the rest of the day. All symptoms had resolved by the next morning (1/10).

                                                The patient experienced dyspnea and chest tightness several minutes after receiving the shot.  She did not notify anyone, and after her 15 minute wait, she went home.  Her respiratory symptoms worsened despite taking a dose of diphenhydramine.  At the urging of her family, she went to the ER four hours later, where she was evaluated.  No treatment was done, and she was told that she was having a mild reaction.  Her symptoms resolved after several hours.

                                                Pt developed post COVID vaccine side effects at 1000.   Pt received COVID vaccine at 0932 by LVN.   Pt complained of a numb throat, and said, &#34;I cant seem to swallow my saliva well.&#34;   This writer did an immediate assessment of patient&#39;s throat with  flashlight, and no swelling, abnormal discharge, or discoloration noted.   Pulse-ox that was available on hand was used on pt, and sats were 96% and HR 78.    MA on site was asked to grab a complete VS machine for somewhere stat, for there was none on site.   This writer reassured pt was going to be okay and to breathe normally, for assessed pt was breathing fast.    This writer called every doctor listed on the &#34;Contact List for COVID Vaccine Clinic,&#34; but there was no response.   This writer then called Urgent Care and Minor Injury Clinic, but the doctors were busy with patients. Asked MAs from those areas to have a doctor call immediately for a patient here was symptomatic.   Once VS got here, VS were taken, and pt was assessed again.    Pt said there was no more numbness in her throat, but tongue was feeling itchy, and her body temp went from hot to cold.    Intitial VS: Temp: 98.3 BP: 122/80 HR: 77 O2: 99% RR: 18   Dr from Urgent Care finally called. Background story given, and she ordered Diphenhydramine Cap 25mg (Benadryl) which this writer had on hand in the emergency kit.   Order was on computer, but could not acknowledge or scan, so order detail was printed, and pt and I signed form together.   Benadryl given at 1025.   Dr also suggested that ID doctor be called.    At 1030, I got a hold of Dr., gave her a background story, and she advised that the pt stay for another 30 mins to be observed and she would come see the pt.    Dr. arrived at 1100, assessed the patient, and ordered Cetrizine Tab 10mg (Zyrtec) to give to pt, which Dr. had to get from another department. There was no Zyrtec available in emergency kit.   Again, order was on computer, but could not acknowledge or scan, so order detail was printed, and pt and I signed form together.   Zyrtec given at 1128. An additional Zrytec Tab 10mg was given at same time at 1128 &#34;for home use&#34; per Dr and per her order.    VS set #2 taken at 1133 Temp: 98.1 BP: 133/94 HR: 63 O2: 100% RR: 16   Dr suggested that she schedule an appt to see an allergist and to get an allergy test done prior to the next dose of the COVID vaccine.    Patient was feeling a lot better and more at ease.   Pt left comfortably with no symptoms at 1200.

Went back to sleep and woke up around 4 am with fever up to 100.6F, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, and extreme fatigue. My left axilla was swollen with arm pain to mid left chest and back, and my axillary lymph node was painful and swollen to about the size of a large grape. I took 440 mg of Aleve around 8:30 when the fever did not subside. The fever broke and did not return. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. My left axillary lymph node is still palpable as of today, 1/15.

                                                High fever 101.9 began the evening when I got my shot and as of an hour ago just came under the 100 mark. I?ve been taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours to combat high fever but it wasn?t going down. I had chills with the fever, so bad that my body was shaking. Fever stayed in the 101 range from Monday evening until Wednesday morning. Extreme shoulder pain radiating from left to right on Monday evening - lasted into the early morning on Tuesday. Chest tightness with R shoulder pain Tuesday afternoon from roughly 130p-315p. It subsided and so I did not seek medical attention. I?ve also had a severe migraine the entire time since getting my shot, but haven?t taken my Ubrelvy as I wasn?t sure how my body would react.

Rash on my arm where I received it went down to my elbow and up to my shoulder and on to my upper back, about 3 hours for it show up. It red, raised and bumpy and it felt hot. This lasted for 4 days. I was very pale and my eyes were sunken in. I literally felt like I was ran over by a vehicle.   I was sleeping for about 15 hours a day. I kept getting chills then I profusely sweats then it switch to freezing cold and back and forth between the two.  I took Tylenol and Benadryl to control symptoms but still felt miserable.  The symptoms all stayed with me to the end. I still do not feel 100%, I am still having ringing of the ears, moderate body aches and headaches.

                                                8 days after my  first vaccine shot, on Jan 19th night, I suddenly started having  pain in the chest. The pain was located in the left side of the lower end of the sternum, in the epigastric region. Pain lasted for 3-4 hours. Initially it was severe, pulsating, acute pain as if nerve pressing against chest. Unbearable pain. I was unable to lie down, turn on sides. Pain would aggravate on movements and if I would touch the specific spot in my chest. . Deep breaths reduced the pain to some extent. Pain severity decreased after 4 hours after which I started getting pain in my left arm, radiating to my pinky finger.  The pain also  radiates to left upper back on movements and exerting left arm for long time, especially typing computer keyboard, doing daily chores cooking, washing dirty dishes, sleeping on the side. ,I am unable to sleep on the left side, if I sleep on left side, I start getting tingling and numbness in my left arm. I did not take any pain medications until Jan 26th as the pain did not disappear. Once at night the pain also radiated to my left leg , I felt  numbness when I tried to sleep on my left side. Occasionally, I feel pain in my right arm and right back. The pain near the sternum area reduced significantly when I took two doses of Ibuprofen 600 on Jan 26th in the afternoon and night. The pain in left arm radiating towards left pinky still persists, with numbness and tingling  if I do daily task for longer duration. Ibuprofen helps to relieve pain temporarily.  Mild pain in right arm, neck and upper arm. I will continue to closely monitor my symptoms.

At 20 mins my throat felt tighter and it was making me cough trying to get air so they gave me 50 ml of benedryl into my right arm. I started to pass out and my breathing was labored so I was given my epipen and taken to the ER. While I was there I was monitored for 4 hours and given 2 more medications. One was a steroid, I?m unsure on the second.

                                                Approximately 2am of 01/29/2021 I became very over heated for about one hour. Around 3am I then became incredibly cold and shaking. Around 4am I got out of bed and stood for a few moments, then walked slowly around my room making my way to our bathroom. I noticed my vision was not right, almost like a fisheye affect and I felt dizzy. I made it to our master bathroom and sat down on a chair for a few moments before I completely passed out. I fell forward, face first on to the bathroom floor hitting the left side of my head. When I regained my conscious I was weak and shaking and was unable to call out to my husband. I slowly pulled myself up to the toilet trying to make some noise and my husband then came to my aide.  As he talked I noticed his voice sounded much farther away than it really was. I also had a difficult time cognitively answering his questions about how I felt. I was pale, clammy, still shaking. This episode from the time I left my bed from the time my husband walked me back to the bed was about 45 minutes. My husband took my temp and I did not have a fever. The next five hours I alternated between feeling very cold and very hot.  I spent the next 24 hours feeling completely depleted. I rested as much as I could and had a greater than normal appetite.

A 31-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via Intramuscular on 23Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was seen in the ED for petechiae and ecchymoses on 15Jan2021. She had not taken any recent medication or had any illness previous to this event. The only feature that was new to her was the vaccination provided 23Dec2020 and 09Jan2021 to complete her COVID series. Lab assessment showed platelet count decreased to 22,000 cells per cubic microliter (normal over 140,000). She had no other findings to describe cause of her decreased platelet count by lab or clinical exam. Provided a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia purpura, in the ED setting, she started pulse dexamethasone 40 mg/day for four consecutive days with a follow blood count showing resolution on day 4 of her treatment with a platelet count of 230,000 cells per cubic microliter. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received Steroids as treatment. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of event immune thrombocytopenia purpura was recovered in Jan2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of immune thrombocytopenia purpura due to temporal relationship. There is limited information provided in this report.

                                                Received the 2nd dose of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine on 1/12/21. Then, 2 days later (1/14/21) I had a CBC with diff drawn, as I am currently being worked up for possible ITP and have been getting a CBC with diff every 2 months to monitor my blood counts. My platelets and other blood counts had been trending up and were back in normal ranges when they were last checked back in November. However, when they were checked again in January after the COVID vaccine series, there was evidence of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. I did not have any symptoms related to decreased blood counts.

                                                At 10:35 I started feeling weird in my body like when I get either an asthma attack or flu type. It was an hour later when I first began to feel lightheaded, dizzy, chills, and then really cold. I started then coughing hard like my throat was closing up and hard to breathe. My chest got tight and had sharp pains right under my chest by my stomach side. My heart rate was fast to the point my watch alerted me at over 135. I took my rescue ProAir inhaler to help but it didn?t. I tried to settle down and not panic to make things worse on my asthma attack. I then had to lay down feel weak. Within the next 15-20 min I used my nebulizer at home to help me breathe. After one treatment it helped me tremendously but still felt tired, nauseous, fatigue, pounding headache, but no fever since I barely checked at 98.5.

                                                My menstrual period had terminated on the previous Saturday. On the day of the vaccine (Tuesday) 3/4 hours after the vaccine I started spotting. This then transformed into moderate vaginal bleeding which lasted for about 4 days. I had no other symptoms and this was very unusual and scary. I had a vaginal ultrasound 2 days after the bleeding started and no abnornalities were found. My pap smear is also clear.

I started taking ibuprophen thinking I may have pulled something but the soreness never subsided. It hurts to move, when I cough, sneeze, etc. I went to the Urgent Care/ ER last night because I wanted to see if something major was wrong, They did blood work and ran a couple of tests but everything came back fine. I didn&#39;t mention to them that I received the first dose of vaccine because I didn&#39;t think I could get a side effect a week later until I looked on the  website today. I&#39;m still in pain and I have no idea what could have caused this other then the vaccine.

After ER visit I was advised to take Zyrtec and Benadryl. I&#39;ve paired it with Mucinex to get rid of phlegm build-up and the doctor prescribed Prednisone which I&#39;m going to start today (03/15/2021). So far I have less tightness/less tingling in heart area (still occurs randomly but not as opten) but still get fatigued and breathless real quick. I&#39;ve also had sporadic headaches brain fog, body chills/aches/weakness/difficulty concentrating. Also had face numbness for 4 days.

I was dizzy during  that day.  I went to visit my doctor afterward and my Nurse Practitioner mentioned that she had seen other people with the same event. I received my second vaccine dose and had no symptoms.

Side note- on Tuesday (day after injection), I donated blood. Not sure if this is relevant. After waking up nauseous, I experience extreme shortness of breath and full body chills for roughly 30 seconds to 1 minute. I walked about 10 steps to wake up my partner and fainted instead. I woke up to him calling my name, and almost immediately threw up. Afterwards, I felt okay, only tired and a little weak. I was able to go back to sleep and woke the next day with no lingering side effects. I would say the entire episode lasted roughly 5 minutes.

                                                Miscarriage; spotting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 31-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), intramuscular at right deltoid on 04Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. She has no known allergies and has no COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included folic acid, iron (PRENATAL) and fluoxetine. The patient has no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Ek9231) at the age of 31-years-old, intramuscular at right arm on 14Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered in a hospital. The patient was pregnant, her last menstrual period was on 19Dec2020. Her expected due date is on 25Sep2021 and gestational period was 7 weeks (also reported as 3). The patient experienced miscarriage and spotting on 09Feb2021 which resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. She was not tested for COVID post vaccination.

This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 31-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6201) at age of 31 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included spinal cord injury due to MVA in 2012, neurogenic (incontinent) bladder and bowel, bladder augmentation and mitrofanoff, chronic neuropathic pain, dependent of wheelchair. Patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included lavender oil (lavender, helichrysum, jasmine). Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 administered in Arm Left on 28Jan2021 01:45 PM (Lot Number: EL8982) at age of 31 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and no reaction on previous exposure to drug. With first menstrual period after receiving vaccine patient had vomiting, chills, sweating, muscle pain, and her head and heart were pounding. It felt bad enough to go to emergency room but she waited it out at home and it lasted a few hours. Patient had a spinal cord injury so the symptoms were similar to what she got with autonomic dysreflexia, but this was the worst case of it she had ever had. She hadn&#39;t vomited in 10 years (or before her spinal cord injury). Patient still had muscle pain in her shoulders and neck. Adverse event start date was on 25Apr2021 12:00. No treatment received. No covid prior vaccination. No covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Autonomic dysreflexia is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.  Medical history of spinal cord injury due to MVA in 2012 may provide a plausible explanation for the event. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I felt shaky  and like I was going to pass out. Very nauseous.  My blood pressure was 169/93 @ 0830. The staff had me lay down.  About  5 min later I started to feel better.  Another 5 min later it happened again in a wave. The symptoms just came over me. My blood pressure @ 0840 was169/104. The staff had me drink water and rest. @0900 the wave came over me again. My BP was 178/111. I drank more water and rested. BP recheck @ 0925 162/112.  @940 BP was slowly coming down at 145/109. At that time they transferred me to the Emergency room.  My BP came back into normal ranges, and the waves stopped happening around 12pm. I was then released home with plans to follow up with Primary care on  1/11/2021

                                                Patient received her covid vaccine on 12/28/2020 in her left arm. Three days after vaccination she had pain and swelling in her right arm. She was seen by a health care provider on 12/31/2020 and an ultrasound showed extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left arm. She was started on a blood thinner (eliquis).  She had blood tests done on 1/1/20 and this showed leukocytosis. She was found to have acute myeloid leukemia and admitted to our service for treatment. We do not have blood tests prior to 1/1/20 so it is unclear when her leukemia started. Her deep venous thrombosis could be related to her acute leukemia but I decided to report it due to the proximity to the time of her vaccine. Her arm pain and swelling improved after administration of the blood thinner. She is currently being treated for her leukemia.

                                                Patient reports that she did not have any issues after the first Covid19 Pfizer vaccine but 5 minute after her second dose she felt like it was hard to swallow. She attributed this to excitement from completing vaccine series and finished her 15 minute wait time. She went home but it became harder to swallow and she felt like her chest was &#34;heavy&#34; and she became short of breathe walking up stairs. She took fexofenadine 180mg and cetirizine 10mg and  filed a report with the CDC. Her symptoms resolved and she slept. The morning after her vaccine she felt fine and went for a 6 mile run. She called vaccine clinic to see what kind of follow up she needed to completed and was asked to contact PCP and employee health.  She presented to PCP that day (day after second vaccine) who reported ongoing symptoms of moderate chest tightness and some throat discomfort. Given prescription for Medrol dose pack, albuterol inhaler, and EpiPen and instructions on when to present for care.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient herself).  A 32-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# El1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 11:45 in right arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID from 15May2020 to an unknown end date. Known allergies was no. Other medications in two weeks included pantoprazole, cholecalciferol (VIT D3), ascorbic acid (VIT C), zinc, fish oil, curcuma longa (TURMERIC). The patient experienced mild cold like symptoms (runny nose and sore chest) 3 days after vaccine on 02Jan2021, blood spots on right abdomen, chest 3-4 days after vaccine in Jan2021. Constant headache for a week starting 5 days after vaccine on 04Jan2021 and elevated blood pressure, racing heart, and chest pain 5 days after vaccine on 04Jan2021. All events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID positive on 15May2020. The patient had COVID test of nasal swab post vaccination and result with negative. Outcome of events were unknown. No treatment was received for events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported bleeding cannot be excluded.

I also experienced hypersensitivity in my breasts, especially my nipples. So much so that I could not allow running water from the shower to touch them or sleep on my stomach. This also started within 24 hours of receiving the first shot and lasted for 5 days.

                                                My left hand turned blue and the veins in that hand looked very dark (almost purple) seconds after I received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19 in my left arm.  My left hand turned blue like it was cold, but I was not cold anywhere on my body.  My left hand&#39;s veins were also mostly purple in the fingertips.  This side effect was not painful and lasted about 30 minutes.  Other symptoms I&#39;ve experienced because of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for COVID-19 in my left arm: - soreness across entire arm, especially at injection site - occurred upon injection and is slowly getting better. I took two 200mg of ibuprofen two days after the injection because the pain randomly got worse without any outward cause - swollen injection site - occurred upon injection and is the same at this time - tingling across entire arm - occurred upon injection and stopped seven hours later at 11pm

                                                Saturday, January 23rd I received my second COVID vaccination around noon. Later that day I developed the typical extremely sore arm.  Sunday January 24th: I started to feel just a general malaise and had some headaches, like I was coming down with something, but other than that felt fine.  Monday January 25th: I was at work and started developing a sore throat, chest tightness with some shortness of breath, myalgias, fatigue, nausea, and minor chills, although I never had a fever.   Tuesday: symptoms were slightly worse  Wednesday January 27th: I went to work thinking all these symptoms were still just from the vaccine as I hadn&#39;t felt any sickness symptoms before getting the vaccine and hadn&#39;t had an exposure I was aware of. While at work, I asked other coworkers if they had any similar symptoms to the vaccine and was told I should call employee health since I was still having such bad symptoms and really didn&#39;t feel too great. I called the employee health line and told them all my current symptoms which were all the same still. They told me that the sore throat and chest tightness with shortness of breath were definitely not from the vaccine and to leave work and get tested. I did this and my test came back negative. Because I was still having bothersome chest tightness, the employee health line also told me to go to the ER, thinking it could be something else significant.   I went to the ER the night of January 27th to get my symptoms all checked out as told to. Everything came back ok and the ER doctor wanted me tested for COVID again Friday around the 48 hour mark to verify it wasn&#39;t the virus. She also told me that if it came back negative, she was sure it must be my reaction to the vaccine.  Thursday January 28th: I stayed home per guidelines from employee health and still had all the symptoms listed on Monday. After a two hour afternoon nap, I finally felt like I was turning the corner. My sore throat felt better besides a huge lump still in my throat and my chest tightness with shortness of breath subsided. I still had bad myalgias, fatigue, headaches and a general sense of not feeling so great.  Friday, January 29th: Feeling slightly better again, main symptom is bad myalgias, especially my neck and small lump in throat. I got retested around 12:30 pm and it came back negative for COVID as well as negative for strep.   Saturday: Feeling almost 100% better besides sore neck still.

A 32-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unknown route, on 12Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Relevant medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD), hypothyroidism and anxiety. Past drug history included allergy to cefprozil (CEFZIL). Relevant concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN XL), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). On 12Jan2021, the patient had tachycardia, facial flushing, fatigue, arm pain and swelling. The events required a physician office visit. Therapeutic measures taken as result of the events included levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). On 14Jan2021, the patient underwent a COVID-19 virus test (nasal swab) which resulted positive. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 12Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 14Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

A 32-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Jan2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included idiopathic hypersomnia and allergies to eggplant. The patient has no covid prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), methenamine, levonorgestrel (MIRENA), propranolol hydrochloride (PROPRANOL) and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took cefazolin and levaquin and experienced allergies to both. The patient has a Mirena IUD and never get her period at all. Within 6 hours of her first Pfizer injection (02Feb2021 16:00), the patient experienced crippling lower abdominal pain followed by very very heavy bleeding and clotting. Resolved within 48 hours as quickly as it came and didn&#39;t occur with second dose 1 week out. The patient was not tested for Covid post vaccination. The events were not treated. The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it  is unlikely that the reported events were causally  related to   BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent  conditions.   A contributory role of the patient&#39;s Mirena IUD  should be  evaluated.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On Thursday March 11, 2021 I received my first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. Within about 5 second after administration I began to feel severe arm pain spreading from the injection site down to my fingers that were tingling and numb. Then within about 20 seconds of the vaccine I  fainted.   The fainting spell was brief, a few seconds, but the symptoms that continued after were long lasting.  My blood pressure after was about 80/50, I was diaphoretic, pale, had moderate arm pain (tingling, numb, painful to move) and severe nausea. I was also light headed. These symptoms lasted through the night but I felt overall improved the next day other than fatigue and lingering arm pain. Then on March 16, 2021, 5 days later, I woke up with extreme fatigue. Over the course of the day I then began to get a headache. I got back in bed and then in the afternoon started to feel moderate arm pain again at the injection site and down the entire arm. Then severe nausea set in again along with more diaphoresis, chills and light headedness. The symptoms this time again lasted through the night and I felt better again the next morning.

The day after the dose of the vaccine I had a headache and body aches with severe back pain in my lower and mid back. My arm became swollen to the size of a baseball around the site of injection. It was a lump on the side of my arm and my arm was numb every once in a while. My arm was very painful and swollen and itchy. I had the issues with my arm for 10 to 14 days after each dose of the vaccine. I have been having severe backache and like something is sitting on my chest. I still very fatigued after 10 weeks and I have severe back ache. I have been using Lidocaine for the pain and Naproxen and a muscle relaxer at times.

                                                The day after the dose of the vaccine I had a headache and body aches with severe back pain in my lower and mid back. My arm became swollen to the size of a baseball around the site of injection. It was a lump on the side of my arm and my arm was numb like maybe a nerve was damaged. My arm was very painful and swollen and itchy. I had the issues with my arm for 10 to 14 days after each dose of the vaccine. I have been having severe backache and like something is sitting on my chest. I still very fatigued after 10 weeks and I have severe back ache. I have been using Lidocaine for the pain and Naproxen and a muscle relaxer at times.

                                                A few weeks after the vaccine I noticed my legs were covered in Peticia which began spreading up the legs.  I was sent to the ER for a CBC but was sent home.  My Dermatatologist performed 2 Punch Biosypies.  I began having joint pains in my legs and stomach pains.  The peticia begin going and coming.  And the test results for the Punch Biopsies revealed I had HSP &#34;Henoch Schonline&#34;.  I began having GI issues with bloody stool, blood in my urine which prompted I be started on a high dose Steroid of Prednisone. On 3/24 I saw a Nephrologist who advised there was still blood in my urine and a  kidney biopsy may have to be perfomed if the steroids does not improve or resolve the issue.  Ive been having nose bleeding also but is unsure if its associated as well and I am scheduled to see and ENT for on 4/2 for that.

                                                Patient was wheeled in on a rolling chair(no wheelchair available at time) from nurse that administered vaccine because of anxiety and a needle phobia that put the patient into a kind of shocked state. Patient was sweating profusely, white to the face, and not speaking very much but would answer questions correctly. EMT was speaking with the PT before walking away to continue other monitor duties when he turned back to see patient limp in chair, head back, eyes rolled back, and some twitching movements of the body. EMT called for rapid response  because first thought of seizure and seizure like activity with the twitching movements. EMT got to patient, supported head up straight, and opened jaw to ensure airway was clear. Patient had no response to EMT trying to communicate. Sternum rub was performed where patient came back conscious nearly instantly. PT was unresponsive for roughly 10-15 seconds. Patient was told of what happened and vitals were taken on her, response team was cancelled with most them already on scene. PT was feeling better, sweating stopped, color to the face returned, and PT was speaking and understanding more clearly than before. PT was given a snack and water and was monitored by EMT for an additional 15mins before patient and staff were confident with her leaving.

A 33-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EH9899, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included patient had sort of allergic reaction not to a vaccine but &#39;a bad reaction&#39;. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received COVID Vaccine on 18Dec2020 and ended up on Christmas she went to take a bath that was on 24Dec2020 or 25Dec2020 and noticed that her legs were all swollen and she was not used to that at all having swollen legs. She did work on her feet but she wasn&#39;t working on her feet for that week, so she just didn&#39;t know what was causing the swelling and within the last couple of days in Dec2020 she had a quick heart rate like her pulse, it&#39;s not that high but for she it was high it was like 112, 115 as her resting heart rate, so it&#39;s just been having like heart palpitations kind of, she just wanted to report that and kind of see if other people were getting that as a symptom possibly from vaccine. She had in her past had sort of allergic reaction not to a vaccine but &#39;a bad reaction&#39;. She had swollen legs like edema, so she was just hoping. And then the patient stated that she wasn&#39;t tired at the starting, so she wasn&#39;t tired the same day&#39; (could not be clarified further). No treatment was received for all events. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I stayed at the Clinic until 30 minutes had been up. When I arrived home I needed to use my Albuterol Nebulizer Solution, and started to get slightly itchy. My chest didn&#39;t start to feel better until after 2am, and the next day I noticed my arm at the injection site was swollen and slightly red.  It is still red to this day and it feels achy all the way to my wrist.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the vaccine Pt said she developed a &#34;fruity&#34; taste in her mouth. She said she got dizzy, extremely hot and felt like she was &#34;swaying&#34; She said she also got what she described as &#34;menstrual like cramps&#34; that radiated all around her abdomen and back. She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

Per everyone around I was bright red and I looked weird. The ER nurse said my heart rate was 125 and my systolic BP was elevated at 130s (normally in the 110s). After sitting for 45 mins heart rate was back to 60s. Still felt like I was in a fog but felt ok. Once I walked to my car I felt alot of nausea again and was on and off the rest of the day.  In the middle of the night I woke up short of breath laying on my back had to lay on my side.  12/21. I was moving pavers and got short of breath. Checked my heart rate and it was 100. O2 sat was 99%. If I sat and didn&#39;t move I was fine as soon as I started moving it started again. Also felt nauseating all day. I was having a hard time concentrating and my husband was getting frustrated that I wasn&#39;t understanding what he was saying. My left arm hurt really bad all day  12/22 By the afternoon felt more normal except my arm still hurting really bad.  12/26 was shoveling dirty and suddenly my arm where I got the injection started hurts and I got very nauseated again.  On 12/29 the cdc called me because I did the vsafe program. They were wondering if I was actually going to get the second vaccination because they said my reaction is a severe reaction.  12/30 my arm started itching had chills and temp right after  1/1 rapid test was negative for covid  1/2 pcr was negative

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine I felt a rush of numbness/tingling/cold starting from my feet that worked it&#39;s way up to my head. Once the feeling got to my chest my HR increased.  Some SOA, suspected due to feeling of panic.  Feeling passed after about 3 minutes but kept coming back in waves about every 10-15 minutes.  Took Benadryl 25 mg at about 2:30 to see if it would help, symptoms calmed down at about 4:00.  The following morning on 1/30, the immediate symptoms had gone away.   By 1/30 evening, starting developing  constant numbness to BLE below knee. As of today, 2/4.  The numbness is still present.

Very abnormal because I have the Nexplanon implanted in my arm and may have 2-3 periods per year. Normally the periods I do have are heavier and last 3-5days.  One week later I had about 3 days of left ovarian pain. Dose # 2- One day (which is today) after receiving my second vaccine I started with scant/ light vaginal bleeding and lower back pain. No ovarian pain yet.

After it broke I would be fine and then have hot flashes and then become cold.  I had a horrible pain between my shoulder blades that radiated into my left chest. I had a headache that lasted for 4 days. No matter the pain reliever used nothing touched the pain. My head hurt so bad it made me nauseous and dizzy. I had excruciating left sided jaw pain. It hurt to open my mouth. It shot up through my jaw into my teeth. I was unable to chew anything on that side due to pain, but I ate very little.

A 33-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot #: EK9231) intramuscularly on 09Jan2021 at 14:00 (at the age of 33-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (OCELLA) taken as an oral contraceptive (OCP) from 04Jan2021 to an unspecified date and cetirizine hydrocholoride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY) taken as a premedication for 3 days prior to 2nd dose.

It was reported that &#34;I was re-dosed with the vaccine dose on 19Jan2021 (as reported) at 2pm. I took Zyrtec (Cetirizine) for 3 days prior. About 5 minutes after the vaccine was administered, I had tongue tingling that lasted approximately 5 minutes, I took 25mg of Benadryl and the tingling did not reoccur.&#34; It was also reported that &#34;nausea occurred immediately after vaccine administration&#34;. The patient stated that her &#34;heart was racing approximately 6-7 minutes after and lasted about 1 minute&#34;. It was reported that none of the events were considered serious due to being life-threatening or due to persistent or significant disability/incapacity. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office and did not require medical intervention. The patient was not hospitalized due to the events. The patient was not admitted to an intensive care unit. It was reported that the patient did not have any bilateral wheeze/bronchospasm, stridor, upper airway swelling, respiratory distress, tachypnea, increased use of accessory respiratory muscles, recession, cyanosis, grunting, dry cough, hoarse voice, difficulty breathing, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, rhinorrhea, measured hypotension, shock, capillary refill time greater than 3 seconds, reduced central pulse volume, decreased level of consciousness, loss of consciousness, generalized urticaria, generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized pruritus with skin or without skin rash, localized injection site urticaria, red and itchy eyes, diarrhea, abdominal pain or vomiting. Relevant tests were reported as not applicable. It was also reported that a culture was not performed.

I went to urgent care and was prescribed Provera to stop the bleeding to no avail. I then proceeded to go to urgent care again because the bleeding had not stopped. At my second Doctors visit, I had an abdominal and a transvaginal ultrasound done, and both of them came back completely normal. I have now scheduled an upcoming obgyn appointment, but cannot be seen until 03/09/2021.

A 33-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK4176 intramuscular in left deltoid on 07Jan2021 as single dose (at the age of 33 years) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Patient had history of ongoing Autoimmune Thrombocytopenia from May2020, ongoing migraines, depression/anxiety and ADHD, and COVID-19 21Apr2020 to &#34;05May2021&#34;.  Concomitant medication included Sertraline Hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), Lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE), Lorazepam  (Ativan), Ondasetron (ZOFRAN) and Sumatriptan succinate (IMITREX).  Historical information regarding dose 1 of BNT162B2 on 17Dec2020 included a moderate injection site reaction lasting 6 days worst on day three. Reaction was characterized by redness, swelling elevated rash surrounding injection site, aching pain radiating from neck to fingers and tenderness to palpitation.  1st dose Vaccine Lot Number: EJ1685, Vaccine Lot Expire Date: Mar2021, Time the Vaccination Was given: 08:00.  After the 2nd dose the patient experienced a moderate headache on 08Jan2021 12:00 for 1 day which responded well to APAP- caffeine and resolved on 09Jan2021 12:00 Patient had a flare up of my autoimmune thrombocytopenia as evidenced by legs covered in petechiae and bruising on 09Jan2021. Emergency room and physician office were not visited however, patient does have standing CBC orders from hematologist, so she had platelet count checked. It had dropped to 109K/uL, which is low for me but not dangerous. Patient originally developed autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) May2021 after COVID Apr2021. Both instances of these side effects were manageable, but patient wanted to report them as there was no data yet available on ITP with the vaccine when she met with hematologist to discuss it. Patient received Acetaminophen 650mg PO (per oral) as treatment.  Lab data included Platelets 13Oct2020 124 kiU/L (normal 140-400) and on 12Jan2021 109 KiU/L.  Event flare up of my autoimmune thrombocytopenia resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00, Platelets dropped to 109k resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00, legs covered in petechiae and bruising resolved on 31JAN2021 00:00 and headache resolved 09Jan2021.

I felt like I had taken adrenaline or steroids and couldn?t sleep that might. The next morning I did not want to get out of bed. My body, particular along my spine, was in so much pain that I began crying. On Monday I called in sick to work. I had almost total numbness in my left arm arm, hand, and upper body. Periodically my heart would race and feel as if was about to beat out of my chest. I started to black out in the grocery store and continue feel dizzy and weak. This is my second day off of work and I have only gotten out of bed to perform essential tasks. I am nauseated and am having trouble eating. I feel like I?ve been run over by several cars and can?t feel my left pinkie. I don?t remember ever feeling this bad for any past illness.

                                                Immediately after vaccination (2/27)  I felt a lot of pain in my left arm. The soreness lasted for about 48 hours then went away. I had other symptoms (headache, body aches, dizzyness, nausea, exhaustion). After about 4 days, I had no more symtpoms. I was regularly exercising during this time, so symptoms were not debilitating.  On Sunday 3/7 I woke up to a lot of pain in my armpit and side chest. It hurt a lot. I  still went for a run (7 miles).  On Monday 3/8 I went for a 4 mile walk. After walk, the site of vaccination (upper left arm) was swollen and red, felt sunburned. It appeared very suddenly midday. I noticed there was a large lump under the skin. I felt aches in my hand, left shoulder, and left side of chest. No respitory problems, only muscular.  On tuesday 3/9 the pain did not go away. I went to urgent care and was told it was a delayed allergic reaction. Vitals were said to be okay. Doctor advised usling a sling to relieve weight/pressure. Told to take Benadryl.

After about 25-30 minutes after I felt like my blood pressure dropped and I actually passed out and once I passed out I don&#39;t know how long I was out for. Maybe less than a minute, I couldn&#39;t breathe and I was hyperventilating and they put a oxygen mask on me. They took me to ER (Hospital) and I recognized I was in there when I &#34;woke up&#34; - they were trying to get an IV in me but I was shaking so much it took several attempts. They gave me several medications because I was nauseated as I wanted to vomit and they gave me anaphylactic medications. I was having chest pains. I fell asleep. They were going to admit me but I kind of refused to be admitted and they let me go with Zofran, prednisone and one other medication. One of coworker took me home. I slept the rest of the day and night. The next day, Really fatigued and chest pain was semi getting better. Breathing - was pretty okay after that. By day 3, I was fine.

Patients history includes contracting COVID back in June of 2020 for which she spent 2 days in the hospital.  In November of 2020, she reports she ended up in the hospital for another 2 days and was diagnosed with post-COVID POTS.  She then went to medical facility and underwent 6 treatments of hyperbaric oxygen in February of 2021. Patient states that after these treatments, she felt great.  She has reportedly been out of work since November, I believe, and was given the OK to return on 3/10/21.  She was also advised by her neurologist that she should take the COVID vaccine which she did on 3/15/21.  Two days later, on 3/17/21, she states that her POTS was &#34;triggered&#34; and she begain to experience dizziness, fainting, fatigue, headaches, nausea and vomiting and various GI issues. Currently, she states these symptoms are getting worse, instead of better, and she has been unable to work, missing last Thursday and Friday, and will be going home early today.  She asks if she should get her second COVID vaccine.  I advised that is something she needs to discuss with her primary care provider.

                                                Per vaccinator&#39;s account, patient became unresponsive immediately following IM injection at 1440 into left deltoid and slumped down in chair. Vaccine Floor Manager (reporter of this Adverse Event) was called over who then radioed for the on-site paramedics to respond. Vaccinator verified patient was still breathing. She was bradycardic with a pulse in the 40&#39;s per vaccinator. Within 15-20 seconds of becoming unresponsive, patient became responsive as paramedics came into vaccine room. Paramedics took vitals and measured a systolic blood pressure of 80 and pulse 44-50 BPM, 98% oxygen. Patient was alert and oriented at this time, transferred to a transport chair and sent to on-site Emergency Room for further evaluation.  As staff were leaving the clinic site at approximately 1630 (including this reporter), we encountered patient self-ambulating in no apparent distress back to her car having been discharged from the emergency room.

                                                Received shot ~12:15pm on March 21st. Only symptom throughout the day was sore arm, but tolerable. Around 10:30 PM, I was in bed and noticed that I feel &#34;agitated&#34; and restless. Looked at my FitBit and noticed that my heartrate was unusually high and climbing. My normal resting heartrate is 60-70 bpm. Last night from 10 PM and onward, it rose from 75 pm up to 130  bpm while I was laying down in bed. Soreness in my arm became much worse and more uncomfortable. I focused on breathing slowly and deeply to try to relax myself but did not have any effect. Throughout the night I could feel my heart racing, fluttering and palpitating. Sometimes I could feel &#34;pinching&#34; like sensations too. Every time I was able to fall asleep, I was quickly jolted awake by those fluttering and racing sensations in my chest. I got up ~2 hours later to get a drink of water and had a low-grade panic attack (lost sense of hearing), felt very weak and light-headed, started sweating profusely. Those symptoms let up a bit around 4AM and I was able to sleep lightly. I continued to feel &#34;agitated&#34; and restless all morning until about noon today, a full 24 hours after the shot, 12 hours after symptoms started. My resting heart rate finally started to return to normal at about that time as well. Felt fine and pretty normal by about 1:30ish PM today.

My cheeks and lips were swelled up. My tongue was starting to swell but I could still breathe. I was wheezing so I took a Benadryl and then took another four hours later. I felt very light headed for the rest of the day. The light headedness and dizziness stayed for a few days with a headache. I did not have second dose on the recommendation of my doctor. I ended up contracted Covid-19 three weeks after the vaccine.

After second dose of Pfizer, the swelling and pain in the neck escallated and three nodules were discovered in my neck at ER visit due to pain from neck and radiating in ears and head. Extremely fatigued and headache was unbearable. ER MD discovered nodules, high white blood count, etc. Sent to follow up with Endo. Endo could not explain. Thyroid labs are all normal but the symptoms and nodules makes this suspicious. ANother ER visit with 3 days hospitalization due to pain and now elevated pulse (even while sitting in ER bed at 135-140 pulse). Low grade fever, nausea, vomiting, lethargic, elevated labs, etc.  Now on propranolol for heart regulation and prednisone to monitor. Multiple CT scans and Ultrasound confirmed the nodules.

                                                About 7 hours after my vaccine, I started experiencing chills and body aches. 9 hours after the vaccine, I felt as if I?d taken cold medicine. I was slow to react, felt ?foggy?, I had trouble recalling words and the names of household objects I was staring at, my movements weren?t coordinated and I dropped a few things. During the night, I was tired but had trouble sleeping. The body aches worsened and really concentrated in my joints, especially my spine. I stayed either in bed or on the couch the whole day following my vaccine but my heart rate (as read by my smart watch) would go from the 70?s to as high as 129 just from sitting up higher in bed. My normal resting heart rate is in the upper 50?s/lower 60?s and I don?t see 120&#43; unless I?m working out for at least 20 minutes. I didn?t take Tylenol or Motrin until 7 PM on April 19th (I took 800mg of Motrin) about 34 hours after my vaccine. I had a low grade fever and my head ached so bad all my teeth were throbbing before I took the  Motrin. I started to feel better within a hour of taking Motrin and was fine from then on. I only took Motrin the one time.

                                                It was almost the end of my 15 minutes when my limbs became tingly and that feeling made its way towards my torso. I started to feel flush and my heart rate rapidly increased. I felt it was nothing so i tried to calm myself and watch my heart rate on my watch and it continued to increase. It started at 100 and within a minute was at 130. I finally honked my horn for assistance and my symptoms continued. I became very faint and nauseous and felt as though i was going to throw up. open my door and took my mask off to help with getting air and it didn&#39;t do much to help. I felt very light headed and uncomfortably closet o passing out than i ever have. This lasted for a good 10 minutes until it slowly passed. Faint, nauseous, hot and rapid heart rate of 130 were my main symptoms and were very uncomfortable.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction 6 days post vaccine 24Dec2020; I had severe chest tightness; SOB; throat soreness; hoarse voice; mouth swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, the patient.  A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

                                                -0715 vaccine administered. -0735 started to feel dizzy/off and right side of tongue felt like it was mildly swelling and itchy. -0735 asked to have blood pressure taken as know when I am having anaphylaxis my blood pressure escalates. -0740 took blood pressure and it was 141/86 in right arm. Normal is 110s/60s-70s. No anxiety feelings.  -0740 throat started to have increased mucous production. Had the tickle and tightness in throat. Asked and received 25mg Benadryl with cup of water. -0742 started clearing throat frequently and slight cough. Knew it was anaphylaxis and told the team I need to go to the ER. Asked for additional 25mg Benadryl. Also took 20mg Famotidine and 2 puffs Albuterol inhaler--this is my prescribed anaphylaxis routine. Had Epipens on standby. -0743 put on O2 saturation monitor and watched O2 drop into 90-92 range. Asked for epipen on standby as I know when I need to start it. Didn&#39;t want to take that when I knew I was about to get it in the ER and knowing self hadn&#39;t progressed that far. Felt chest tightness and shortness of breath. Voice started becoming hoarse. -0800 EMS arrived (delay as team didn&#39;t know if they were supposed to call 911 or a Code--they chose EMS even though in hospital). Then staff at COVID vaccine clinic kept emphasizing need to go in ambulance while EMS and self fought to go through hospital (much quicker route). Finally cleared to go through hospital to ER. To get some air via breathing in had to sit up leaning forward. Voice completely hoarse by this time. -About 0817 arrived to ER bay. At this time, frequently coughing and cough started to sound stridorous. Difficulty getting breaths in. Had chest pain near heart. Greeted by MD, 2 RNS, and technician. -0819 received IM epinephrine. Attached to 5 lead EKG monitoring and O2 monitoring. Blood pressure done again. Higher than previous. -About 0821 had working IV (previous two attempts failed as veins were constricting). Given IV Solumderol. Started bolus of 1L Normal Saline. -Not sure how long after by cough subsided, increased mucous production subsided, as well as hoarseness decreased. -Held for observation for 2hours (would be longer if not resolved). - Discharged around 1015. At this time, hoarseness almost all gone. Minimal throat clearing. Cough resolved.  -Prescribed epipen inhalers (mine expired) and Prednisone. Prednisone is PRN for mild breathing difficulties if it starts again tomorrow 1/13/21.  -At 1400 took 50mg Benadryl and 20mg Famotidine as previously prescribed for anaphylaxis maintenance. Will continue this as previously prescribed every 6hours until symptoms stay resolved. -Made follow up appointment with Primary Care Physician per protocol

Blood pressure was elevated &gt;180/90, HR 110-120.  Gradually decreased and at approximately 30minutes post injection, blood pressure was &lt;145/90 and HR 84.  Took 25mg of benadryl approximately 1 1/2 hour after injection time. Symptoms persisted mildly for another 30-45 minutes after benadryl and seem to be gone 5 hours later. Blood pressure 5 hours after was 134/85 which is still a slight elevation from my norm.

Later that morning 6:30am, I developed severe fatigue, dizziness upon standing and walking,  a L sided headache, L sided arm pain extending from elbow to sternocleidomastoid muscles on the L side, and axillary lymphadenopathy in the same arm as the vaccine (left). I took 650mg of Tylenol and went to work. Walking at a normal pace, my heart rate was 145. At rest inside the hospital it was in the 110s (measured by watch). the headache lasted all day on 1/9 and 1/10 and my neck felt slightly stiff (it was difficult to turn my head to look at traffic behind while driving). I took additional doses of Tylenol on 1/9 and 1/10 and by the AM of 1/11, all of my symptoms had resolved except for the L axillary lymphadenopathy.

                                                After the vaccine was administered the patient sat in the waiting room for less than 5 minutes and then felt a fast HR, she felt hot and was worried that she was going to faint. She also felt shaking in her hands and her arms felt heavy.   She came back to the nurse that had administered her vaccine at 1:10pm where her oxygen level was monitored and she was given a cold cloth and water to drink. This lasted for about 20 minutes. Her oxygen level was monitored (~97%), her BP was checked at 1:45pm and it was 125/90. Her hotness, elevated HR, and shakes went away. At 2:00pm her BP was checked again and it was 139/96 and then again at 2:05pm where it was 132/90.   The patient stated that she felt fine and normal by now and also said that she had a BP cuff at work and at home and said that she would monitor it. All 3 of 3 follow up options discussed with patient: virtual care, the CDC, and/or 911 depending on her condition. The patient left at 2:15pm and patient was called 1 hour later for follow up.  On the follow-up call the patient stated that she was feeling fine and that her BP was 126/90. She said she would continue to monitor her BP and follow-up with virtual health if it wasn&#39;t back to normal by tomorrow.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (COIVD-19 Vaccine) , via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Crohn&#39;s disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 in 2020 to an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for Crohn&#39;s disease.  The reporter is a physician who is reporting and AE for a patient who received the vaccine and subsequently developed symptoms including short of breath, fever, headache, nausea, difficulty swallowing with seriousness criteria of Medically significant on 03Jan2021. The patient self-medicated with benadryl and symptoms resolved briefly but then went to urgent care with re-occurring symptoms and was prescribed prednisone. Caller states the patient&#39;s symptoms have resolved. She is calling to get more information to determine if the patient should receive the second dose. The reporter further stated that she has a patient who received her first shot, clarified as the COVID-19 Vaccine. About an hour and 45 minutes later, the patient had shortness of breath and then later had a fever, headache and nausea. It was later that night when the patient had a fever. The patient had difficulty swallowing which worsen; she was feeling as if her throat was closing. The patient is a nurse, so she self medicated with Benadryl. After taking the Benadryl, the patient was better in the early morning. When the doctor&#39;s office opened, the patient called and was having similar symptoms, clarified as all the symptoms mentioned above. The patient went to the urgent care where she received more Benadryl and was started on prednisone. Caller did not know the dose of prednisone the patient had received. After that, the patient started feeling better. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID19 Vaccine is due around 24 to 26Jan2021. The patient has not called the doctor/caller back. The caller assumes that the patient has recovered but could not be certain. Caller added that the patient also experienced chest tightness when she was having shortness of breath. The patient&#39;s fever was 101 on 03Jan2021. The patient was not drooling with her difficulty swallowing. Caller stated that the patient had a positive COVID test earlier, she thinks it was maybe 3 to 4 months ago (in 2020). The patient has not received another COVID test since she received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to the caller&#39;s knowledge. Reporting physician is an internal medicine physician.

At ~ 0500 on 1/14/21 (~18 hrs after vaccine), I woke up as I was in SVT. I was not able to convert myself and had to go to ED for treatment. HR was 232 upon arrival to ED. Prior to administering adenosine, SVT resolved on own. SVT episode lasted ~2hrs.  I have not had a prolonged SVT episode since ablation in 2016. ER doc mentioned that perhaps fever/ illness from vaccine lowered my threshold for going into SVT.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular on 05Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Mild ADHD/ADD. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving vaccination, she was standing in the observation room (where they had all of them stay for at least 15 minutes to ensure no severe reactions) and experienced a sudden onset of vertigo, tunnel vision and pre-syncope. Her hands became cold and numb and she was trying to talk to another staff member who was arranging/scheduling her second vaccination dose at the same time when this event occurred, but it subsided quickly and she started to feel normal again. All these events occurred at 12:45 on 05Jan2021. She reported this event right away and they had her stay in the room longer. She was stable at that point but experienced these symptoms again but very mildly twice more while she walked back to her car to go home. Other side effects on 05Jan2021 that started in the evening and for the following 2-3 days included fatigue, sore arm, leg/thigh aching, sniffles/sore throat, brief dry cough and slight headache/neck ache. Very mild and tolerable symptoms. All events were reported as non-serious by reporter. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and the patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of all events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for reported events.

We pulled into the waiting area and around five minutes after the injection the right side of my face went numb., the pain had left my arm and chest by the time.  The nurse reacted by calling the emergency room and sending me there.

Felt as if I was intoxicated, lasted the whole day. Woke up the next morning and still felt &#34;out of it&#34; and weak but thought it would get better, went to work (im a nurse). Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

                                                The evening of the day I got the shot, I began to get tired and started to have a sore arm.  Throughout the night, the arm soreness got worse and I got joint pain.  The whole next day, I experienced severe malaise, headache, chills, fever, and joint pain with the site soreness.    The arm pain got worse.  That night, I struggled to sleep.  The whole day after that, I had less malaise and the fever had gone down but the injection site reddened and grew even warmer and more tender.  That evening it was difficult to sleep as the soreness in my arm migrated to the shoulder, armpit and the right side of my chest, along where a bra band would go on the distal right side of the chest.  The next morning (today) the entire armpit area and upper distal right side of the chest were hot and tender.  This afternoon, I palpated the area and noticed at least one swollen lymph node.  My arm still hurts.

The following morning, I continued to have numbness in my hands but also in my face. By the evening , the day after I had received the vaccine, I felt like my swallowing was slightly impaired and I went to urgent care. I was able to complete all neurological tests and given a prescription for hydroxyzine, thinking that I may have had a slight histamine response.  I slept approximately 10 hours that night and then fell asleep again from 8:30-11:30 this morning due to high levels of fatigue. Today (~54 hours later), the numbness in my hands and face seems to be getting slightly worse.  I also feel some generalized weakness. I&#39;m still able to do normal day to day activities but it feels abnormal.

                                                Symptoms of nausea began day of, were moderate for several days.  Did not eat much the day of the vaccine due to these symptoms. Numb feeling, tingling in extremities for 2-3 days post vaccination.  Still some occasional numbness and tingling in nose, facial area, and back of head/neck.  Diarrhea for a couple of days.  Continue to experience mild nausea 1.5 weeks later.  Did not have problems with nausea previously.   Moderate fatigue for about a week following vaccination.  Still noticing mild fatigue, getting tired easily and earlier than usual.   Arm was sore from the day after vaccination until about 4-5 days had passed.  Still otice an occasional pain  when moving arm around a certain way.   For 4-5 days following vaccination noticed various body pains.  Pain in lower back- not muscle pain but something else.   Chest wall pain when breathing in from 1-2 days to about a week post vaccination. Headache for a day.  Brain fog feeling, forgetfulness beginning the day after vaccination and was noticeable for about a week.  Still noticing this mildly and feeling more lightheaded than usual.   Over the last few days, I&#39;ve noticed chest tightness and some mild coughing.  It&#39;s also below zero here, so this could be related to weather and dry air, or possibly related to the vaccine.   Generally, I recognize that the above symptoms are possible after this vaccination.  However, the existing literature seems to suggest these symptoms should last 1-3 days and be mild.  My experience has been that they were worse than mild, most lasted at least a week, and some seem to be continuing.   I am also breastfeeding a 19 month old.  He had a brief bout of redness on about half of his body (underarms, forearms, thighs, knees) for about 30 minutes a week after I received the vaccine.  He has never had that before for no apparent reason, and it did not continue, although he has reacted to lotions and certain brands of diaper wipes in this way previously.  We have also noticed that he&#39;s been more irritable lately- throwing tantrums easily, sleeping more often, and getting inconsolable.  We haven&#39;t tied this to any illness, although we do recognize that toddlers can through periods where they have more challenging behaviors.  This is unusual for him though, he&#39;s generally happy and agreeable.  I thought I&#39;d mention it just in case there&#39;s been some sort of pattern that other breastfeeding moms have noticed.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the initial Covid shot, I experienced elevated heart rate, nauseated, and uncontrollable shaking. EMS was notified and they monitored me for 30 &#43;mins with VS. My heart rate was 116 and BP was 164/109. I felt 100% calm inside, but my body was shaking all they way down to my feet, and I could not stop it. This was NOT an anxiety attack. I was breathing normal, just could feel my heart racing. My normal BP is never higher than 130/80.  I was given the  option to go to hospital or have someone drive me home. I declined , as symptoms stopped a little over 30 after vaccination. Lastly, for the future I was informed of the option for more monitoring for next dose, in 30 min reaction line.

                                                I was shadowing another interpreter on Jan. 11, 2021  and started to feel warm, nausea. I sat down and the PA asked if I was ok and then I don&#39;t remember anything. I then fainted and my Heart rate was 30 and they called a code blue. They took me to the ER and ran test and gave me IV and everything came back normal.  After that incident, there was at least two other times I had to sit down because I was getting all the same symptoms again and thought it would happen again.  I did donate blood on January 8. I was feeling fine when prior and the following two days.

The cold heart sensation lasted for roughly 20-30 minutes. Following the start of the cold heart sensation, I became dizzy, sweaty, lost peripheral vision, had numbness in my fourth and fifth fingers (ring and pinky fingers) in both hands, and vaccination site attendant mentioned my hands looked red. Dizziness and other symptoms lasted about 15-20 minutes. Now that over 24 hours have passed, my chest feels a bit tight when I breathe. Injection site is also sore.

At 8:00pm, I took 25 mg Benadryl. On Saturday, I still had the rash, so I took 3 doses of Benadryl over the course of the day to relieve the rash and itching.  The rash resolved Sunday.  On Saturday afternoon, I began to develop mild respiratory symptoms as well.  My chest became very tight. I took 30mg of prednisone at 4:00pm. This provided relief. The tight chest fully resolved Monday morning.

                                                First vaccine I could feel the vaccine go into my body and down into my legs. It was a very strange sensation. I felt very fatigued 30 min after the vaccine but ignored it because it was not normal to have symptoms after the first vaccine. That night i did feel a litlle bit of swelling in my lips that continued into the next day but it was not severe. The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don&#39;t really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn&#39;t feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work. It is now 4 weeks since i had the vaccine and i am still experiencing  some symptoms that seem to be in relation to after i eat. That includes lip swelling, tightness in the muscles around my throat (feel as if they are strained), stomach burning, indigestion, heartburn.  Called PCP again who recommended I see an allergist/immunologist.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on Thursday, morning (11Feb2021), at the time her arm hurt. She had body aches the entire Friday (12Feb2021) and headache; she stayed in bed all day and the next day, she took Tylenol. On Saturday (13Feb2021), she had shortness of breath and the urge to vomit (nausea), she was about to faint. She was also dizzy and checked her blood pressure, it was &#34;high&#34;, around 129/88, but she can&#39;t recall the values exactly. She doesn&#39;t know if she should get the second dose because she&#39;s scared. The patient wanted to know if these are symptoms from the vaccine or could it have been a reaction or allergy. She is scheduled for the second dose on 04Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received my first dose Pfizer vaccine on 03-09-2021. I have a history of blood clot, 10 years ago. I am currently 9 weeks pregnant. I called my doctor&#39;s office who encouraged me o go to the ER since I was having symptoms of a blood clot. I went to the emergency room at Hospital where they did some blood testing.  I then went to Hospital where they did more lab work and blood testing, they did an D-dimer test ad my level was at 3.23 and explained to me it could be due to my pregnancy. They ran some more tests showing I have a  clot in the superficial femoral/ popliteal vein. They placed me on Lovanox medication for two days. I will be seeing a maternal fetal doctor tomorrow for further evaluation. They also monitored my baby and baby is doing fine.

I had fast heart palpitations that it woke me up,  when I woke up I had difficulty breathing and felt Severe chess pain. I felt pressure and started coughing a lot. My husband helped me with some breathing exercises and helped me call online 24 hour Kaiser nurse. My chest hurt a lot and  they recommended I went to emergency. I did and they said x-ray and cardiogram was ok. They injected a pain killer and left me there until morning. Then I was released. Pain killer helped. On Friday evening I had no more chest pain, but I felt nauseous, had chills, body aches, headache and no appetite. These symptoms lasted until Monday. I started to eat again bread and butter by Tuesday, I deleted better on Tuesday, I was still  very fatigue, low energy and sensitive stomach, mild nausea. Nausea  stopped Wednesday, stomach was still mild sensitive still.

                                                No pain or adverse event for the first 4 hours after vaccination. Starting at 2pm, which was 4 hours after my vaccine, , my chest began to tighten. It was not severe; I took a normal walk and was just mildly uncomfortable. It escalated hourly for about 10- 12 hours. At 8pm, the pain, pressure, and tightness around the chest went from mild to moderate, from a pain level of 2 to about 3 or 4. The sensation was one of a stack of books on my chest. There was pressure and mild pain (again, not severe), about 8-10 inches horizontally across my chest, from about the bottom of my sternum to the collarbone. I also felt some pressure in my lower throat, perhaps the bottom third of my neck. I did not have any shortness or breath, swelling, or difficulty swallowing. At about 9 pm, I became itchy on my neck, ankles, and flank. I developed some red spots, which were not large enough to be hives, They mostly became red from my itching, though they were more moderately itchy than seriously itchy. I have had hives before, and they did not appear to be hives, more just isolated red spots. Once I became itchy, I went to the ER. They worked me up for cardiac issues and a blot clot, but all tests were negative. I did not take any medication other than my standard Oxcarbazepine 8pm dose of 300 mg. The itchiness went away at about 11pm (two hours after onset), and the chest pain did not worsen. The following morning, it was significantly better, and about 36 hours after I first received the vaccine, it was gone entirely.

Discomfort and feeling of swelling continued through Sunday evening. Monday (3/15/21) patient began using compression stocking and elevating leg, which eased some discomfort. Slight swelling, discomfort, and heat in the leg continued throughout entire week. DVT presumed. Contacted physician. Treatment for DVT and treatment dosage (Fondaparinux 7.5mg) commenced Wednesday (3/17/21) through to date. Discomfort has dissipated but slight swelling still remains. Appears to be getting better each day, although a very slow progression. Patient history of antiphospholipid syndrome has been managed for over fifteen years with blood thinners. Onset of a clotting event always followed a justifiable cause. No spontaneous/unexplainable clotting events to date. Patient otherwise healthy without any other current event which could explain a blood clot following vaccination. Reporting this information as it may be helpful in determining whether persons with APS or similar condition should receive Covid-19 vaccination. Note: this information being provided by patient.

                                                Within 10 minutes of injection, patient started to say her eyes were moving by themselves behind her eye sockets and she was feeling alot of &#34;snapping&#34; in her body.  Her blood pressure and pulse were higher than normal and she could not keep her eyes open well. She was observed by nurses for approx 30 minutes and those symptoms seemed to subside although she was not steady walking. Midway into our 30 minute drive home it all started again, this time she said she felt heaviness in her chest but was pointing to her throat.  I immediately drove her directly to the ER. Was monitored for 4 hours and was release to go home, be observed and follow up with Neurologist when possible.  Throughout the night, she continued to say she was shaking alot on the inside and her eyes were still moving involuntarily.   3/20/19 at 8:30 am I called her Neurologist to inform her patients symptoms were continuing.  I waited 8 hours and called back only to have her tell her service I was to call patients Primary Physician.  Which I did.  Dr. was on call and quickly  prescribed medication to help calm patients symptoms.  She prescribed Valium 2mg q 6 hours. 3/21/19:  Patient is still experiencing shakiness, involuntary eye movement and fatigue.  She does not have arm pain at injection site.

I could not think clearly. I went home and felt that my ear drum felt numb as well. Went to my PCP and she said it seems I was having an allergic reaction and she recommended Pepcid and Benadryl for 3 days. The next morning I noticed I slept for 16 hours. and I was very confused, I could not keep my legs underneath me, I went to ER and my BP was 153/33, my pulse was 120. They kept me there I am not sure for how long, they did some labs and gave me some IVs and told me to go home and rest. Next day I woke up and I was throwing up, shaking, I thought I was going to die and I returned to the ER. They gave me some nausea meds. I returned to my PCP and she put me under BP meds she believes all was caused due to anxiety. I am still taking BP meds.

A 34-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 34 years of age), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma wherein she doesn&#39;t take medication, it was usually when she was cold; she had this diagnosis since her childhood. She was diabetic and was diagnosed when she was 16 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included insulin human injection, isophane (HUMULIN N) and insulin human (HUMULIN R), both for diabetes mellitus. Historical vaccine include PFIZER BIONTECH COVID 19 VACCINE first dose on 06Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. She got the second dose and her arm on the side she got her shot was hurting from her hand to her chest for about 10 days. Then she got diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. The left side of her face has been twitching and droopy and not right. She got the second dose on 26Jan2021. Three days later was when she started experiencing the pain on left arm (29Jan2021). The shot was given in the left arm. It took 10 days to heal. Then after that was when she started to feel her face. She tried to call the doctor and they couldn&#39;t see her until 08Mar2021 to get diagnosed. She had been on medication for two days. She started one medication on Monday. There had been no improvement yet. One of the medication was Acyclovir 800mg tablet. She was taking it five times per day. She started it on 09Mar2021. The other medication she takes three at the time for the first six days. Then two at a time. It was a steroid. She started it on the 08Mar2021. She added that she was a diabetic and being on the steroid had her blood sugars high now. They said it was stress and not eating right. Investigations included blood work and checked her thyroid, both with unknown result. Then when she got in to the doctor she was diagnosed because it had been going on for five weeks. The arm pain started a couple of days after the vaccination (29Jan2021). It was after 10 days when she developed Bell&#39;s Palsy (Feb2021). The day that she got it she had nausea and threw up that night (Feb2021). She had gone to the emergency room for the arm pain as she was in bad pain and didn&#39;t go to work for 2 days. The ER told her it could take 10 days. She doesn&#39;t remember the exact date. It was sometime the first week of Feb2021. The outcome of vaccination site pain was recovered on 08Feb2021, chest pain was recovered on an unknown date; while unknown for other events. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of Bell&#39;s palsy and vaccination site pain.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included endometriosis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on Tuesday (unspecified date). She thought she felt muscle spasms in the vaccinated arm, it felt like it was matching her heart rate. Her heart rate in the vaccinated arm had a mark for arrhythmia. She spoke to a family member who is a medical student, he thought it was caused by pressure on the vessel or pressure on the area. She reported having a rare form of microscopic endometriosis. She also read in a magazine that there were 36 cases of severe reactions after receiving the COVID vaccine. Not sure if it was the Pfizer COVID vaccine, but in one case, a female had heavy vaginal bleeding and her obstetrician found that she had 0 platelets although the week before her platelet count was normal. On 19Mar2021, when probed for the side effects experienced, consumer stated, &#34;Yesterday there was some aching in the arm but I thought perhaps the stiffness is going to be, the onset of stiffness is going to start but it didn&#39;t start as stiffness it just started progression to muscle out what I thought, muscle spasm. If I put my arm bended towards my chest that&#39;s when I would feel sort of a pop or some type of spasm and I drop my arm just like shake it off that would stop the static. When I work at my desk I keep my arm folded and today this morning is when I started to feel that the spasm in my fore arm sort of matched my heart rate a little bit and I thought do I feel my heart rate in my arm I thought that was impossible but apparently you can. I have a blood pressure check machine just to make sure I don&#39;t have high blood pressure which I have never had but I just in case you just want to check your &#39;vital signs&#39;. I put that on, it also checks &#39;report&#39; and your heart rate. I put it on my right arm which was the non-vaccinated arm because I didn&#39;t want to irritate inflammation in the vaccinated arm. When I put it my right arm my &#39;signs&#39; they were perfectly fine and it was 118 over 66 and pulse rate 85 but I thought, you know I really need to check the arm that I felt the, that was vaccinated but I actually felt the heart beating through the arm &#39;is due to&#39; muscle spasm so I put the device on that arm that was vaccinated, my left arm and when the results stopped it was completed, it was 107 over 68, 81 Pulse but then it had the notation that I had arrhythmia, I thought that here must be the heart , I don&#39;t know if it was skipping and so I thought it is a perhaps a blood clot matter but I keeping think what Pfizer had blood clot side effects so that&#39;s where I started to check and when I started to check on maybe compression or maybe inflammation I didn&#39;t want to assume blood clot so I checked for inflammation and compression. My sister&#39;s husband is a doctor, he said it sounds like Thoracic outlet syndrome and that compression but then there is like the &#39;veins&#39; one which is the blood clot, then I thought man that does sound like what I have but the fact that it was involved with blood clot but let me check to see if Pfizer did have a blood issue or a blood clot matter, that&#39;s when I thought those rare side effects. I have Endometriosis (History) but I have rare type of Endometriosis that&#39;s called microscopic (not spelled) and so it travels throughout head to toe of my body and always triggers some sort of inflammatory problem that mimic other type of condition, either trigger finger arthritis and then I don&#39;t get also sensation and then it&#39;s ruled out and then I don&#39;t have it back but it mimics something that&#39;s different and that&#39;s what I am little concerned because if the vaccine attacks right there.&#34; For treatment, consumer stated, &#34;I did immediately because I have heavy blood flow with Endometriosis, it&#39;s little bit frightening that the vaccine could be taking out my platelets and if I start bleeding I may just end up hemorrhaging and I went to online because the fastest thing to do on weekend, it&#39;s doing online when I did quick diagnostic to do the complete blood count to check my platelet numbers are okay so I just ran to the store that has a blood diagnostic and they were closing so I explained to them my concern about maybe having ITP and they could be attacking my platelets and if they could just you know stumbles it  later and draw the blood they did so I am waiting that may take a day to receive the results.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 118 over 66 and 107 over 68, full blood count: result unknown, heart rate: 85 and 81, SARS-COV-2 test: unknown result and weight: i think i am now 190 on unspecified dates. The outcome of the events was unknown.

All these with outcome of unknown. The patient was not in anaphylactic shock, but she was initially given diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) to treat the symptoms, but it had no effect. She was admitted to emergency room and was given epinephrine and prednisone and things started to get better. The next day symptoms returned, and patient went to urgent care the next morning. There the patient received another prescription for prednisone for 5 days. After that finished her symptoms returned and was given another round of prednisone for 6 days. The patient was still having slight symptoms that she was treating with fexofenadine (ALLEGRA) twice per day per advice of allergist. The patient was met with an allergist and was slightly concerned and thought it was unusual that this would continue past symptoms of 2 weeks. It was reported that the patient was experiencing slight symptoms, nothing crazy, but was wondering what communication from Pfizer was if someone did have an allergic reaction that most people were treated in emergency room. On an unknown date, the patient had allergy tests and no information found on allergy tests. It was reported that the patient antibody testing was not currently recommended to assess for immunity. The patient was discharged with instructions to get an epi pen in case anything got crazy, and her husband drove her home. It was stated as soon as it was her turn the system disconnected. The patient stated the only reason she waited after 4 hours was because she was 5th in line, and it took 2 hours 50 minutes to get to be her turn. The patient was on hold for four hours and she got hung up on, but she was not sure if the system was down, but she got an email and, in the case, it had her interactions. Among the Vaccine recipients, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site within 7 days after an injection was the most reported local reaction, with less than 1% of participants. In general, local side effects; the ones you get on the arm where you got the shot (such as injection site redness and injection site swelling) were mostly mild-to-moderate in severity and resolved within 1 to 2 days. Side effects that you may experience throughout the rest of your body; (systemic side effects) including fever and chills were observed with the first 1 to 2 days after vaccination and resolved shortly thereafter. Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), which generally resolved within 10 days, is likely to have resulted from a robust vaccine-elicited immune response. A cross all age groups reporting severe pain. Since the vaccination the patient was not tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient was suggested  not to get the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination of any type.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.  Follow-up (27Apr2021): This is a follow-up spontaneous report from a contactable Pharmacist. New information included: patient medical history, concomitant medications, new non serious adverse event (sore throat, shortness of breath and chest tightness, mild facial erythema flushing and fever up to 99.5°F.); Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be excluded based on the temporal relationship The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I got transferred to the er where I received the epipen along with oxygen and antiseizure meds for my seizure. I was then transferred to Medical Center for further care where I was later discharged.

                                                I am an APRN, and received the vaccine not quite one week ago. I waited 15 minutes within the facility and then left. Sat in my car working for about 8-10 minutes when a sudden rush of heat ran through my body.  I felt lightheaded, my tongue was prickly, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I was able to get back into the facility to let them know of the sudden symptoms.  At that time I felt like my heart was racing and was diaphoretic. They continued to watch me for another 15-20 minutes, they did have an epi pen but it was not given. I was feeling slightly better and then left again.  I waited in my car approximately 20 minutes before deciding it would be safe to drive away.  After driving for about 10 minutes I had another rush of heat, lightheadedness, and then I started having shortness of breath.  At this time it would have been about 1 hour, maybe longer, since receiving the vaccine.  I was not close to an emergency medical facility at that time, and did not feel like my throat was swelling so thought it would be best to try to drive to the nearest ER.  I knew I had an epi pen from my work that I could use if needed.  I contacted another nurse practitioner who I work with who stayed on the phone with me until I was able to get to a safe place.  At that time the symptoms had improved, not resolved.  It had been able 20 minutes during this episode.  In all, I continued to feel jittery for about 3-4 more hours.  Since my symptoms did improve I did not go to the ER.  I contacted my health department, Louisville health dept, the following day and reported symptoms to the medical director.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site.

After waiting in the monitoring area for 45 minutes I drank some water and felt like my bilateral upper thighs were difficult to lift when I tried to walk to my car. I went home and was tachycardic 120-130bpm that continued throughout the night to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep my heart was pounding so hard and fast. I was extremely thirsty and dehydrated all night.  I continued to have tachycardia for several days despite hydrating. My thighs also continued to feel week for several weeks. I developed a 100.7 F temperature and had flu like symptoms the following days.

A 35-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EH9899), intramuscular at arm left on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at other (as reported). Medical history included asthma (Allergy induced asthma). Concomitant medication within 2 weeks of vaccination included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) from Dec2020 at 10mg daily.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 31Dec2020, the patient experienced Left Bell&#39;s palsy, numbness and paresthesia of tongue, left side of face, inability to raise left eyebrow, pain in left upper arm between elbow and shoulder, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure.  The adverse events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the adverse events which included Prednisone 20mg daily, Valacyclovir 1000mg twice a day. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the Bell&#39;s palsy and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  However, the Bell&#39;s palsy may possibly represent a concurrent medical condition.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including viral serologies, and concomitant medications.

She took her albuterol inhaler, but did not feel better, and proceeded to go to the ER. She has a history of asthma, but regards it as mild and only takes albuterol as needed.  She denies having any cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular symptoms.  At the ER, she was administered diphenhydramine and corticosteroids--she began to subjectively feel better.  She denied a history of allergic reactions to medications or vaccines, and denied a history of anaphylaxis.  She was not taking any medications on the day of her reaction, and was at her baseline health.  She had no vaccines within the past 14 days.

There were no complications with the miscarriage.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

A 35-year-old female patient received second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021) intramuscularly on 12Jan2021 (between 8:30 to 9 am) at left deltoid for Covid-19 prevention. The first dose was received on Wednesday (unspecified date). Patient had no medical history and had no concomitant medications. At night of 12Jan2021, the patient had a fever of 102, but she went to bed with it and she woke up in the morning around 4:30 or 5 am (13Jan2021) in a pool of sweat, so she took her temperature and she was fever with 103.6. Patient took Motrin (Store Brand, lot number as either: 0GE2417A or OGE2417A, expiry: Apr2022) three 200 mg tablets, for a totally of 600 mg for the fever and had a cold shower, and the temperature came down to 103. Then after like 10-15 minutes of her laying on the couch with ice packs on her arms and stuff, it went down to 102.6. Patient was not going to go to the ER for just the fever, but then she started having heart palpitations, and she took her blood pressure and it was 170/113 and her heart rate was 176. Patient went to the hospital, and when they took her heart rate, it was 156. She had her blood taken at the hospital and everything was normal, except that her Potassium was a little low, it was 3. The ER did an EKG that showed Sinus Tachycardia and she was given IV Fluids (two boluses of 0.9% Normal Saline, 2000 mL total via IV, a bag of Potassium IV, two oral tablets of Potassium, unspecified total dose), and everything went back down. She had to call out from work that day and planed to follow up with her Primary Care Physician (PCP) in a couple of days. Patient was no longer had the fever, high blood pressure or high heart rate, as when she left the ER this morning, her temperature was 98, blood pressure was 111/82, and her heart rate was 96. She felt good now, but she did not know if it could happen again. Patient thought that it was maybe just her immune response to the vaccine, so she would say that she has recovered probably close to completely. Patient also had a headache and ringing in her ears, and those had resolved by now as well. The events Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure resolved on 13Jan2021 and other event resolved in Jan2021. The patient stated that the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) could have been serious with her blood pressure being so high, but it was not so serious because she did the right thing and went to the ER for treatment and got fluids. She believes the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) are medically significant. The patient believes that the events she experienced were directly caused by her receiving the vaccine, as she has never had these symptoms before other than she of course has had fevers in her life in the past.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On Saturday, January 23, 2021 I woke up around 5:30 in the morning with itchy hands and feet, after my second dose/ Just as I did with my first dose- Which subsided with Benadryl. However the second dose was given Thursday, January 21. The progressing of the itchy hands and feet lead to my bottom lip swelling excessively large , my tongue begin to swell, my upper lip begin to swell, my lungs begin to burn in my airway begin to tighten. I took two Benadryl and called my family to call 911 and take me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was very low pulse was very high. I had genital pain and swelling, dizziness , nausea vomiting, and extreme body pain. I was given epinephrine, breathing treatments, steroids, Benadryl, and IV fluids. Labs were drawn and my creatinine was high. After about four hours the swelling has gone down and I was able to go home. I have to take steroids for three days, Benadryl for seven , and famotidine.  I have no history of severe allergies, in fact I was tested for food and environmental allergies about a year ago and everything came back negative. I have no history of reacting to any vaccine at any time.

CDC Vsafe called and asked me to report as an adverse event though I wouldn&#39;t consider more serious than most. Had low grade fever (99-100) on tylenol, chills, rigors, myalgias and joint pains starting about 12 hours after vaccination.  Went to work the following day (I am an physician) and by about 10 am had a presyncopal event and was unable to stand/continue working. Was unable to stand without feeling faint for about the next 6 hours.  Was febrile until about 8pm 1/9, never over 100 while taking tylenol. Symptoms completely resolved by 1/10 AM except fatigue for the next 4 days or so, though I developed axillary lymphadenophathy on the side of vaccination starting 1/12 for about 5 days.  No effect whatsoever on the fetus.

She went to the ER; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. This nurse reported for a 35-year-old female patient (Daughter) received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 Vaccine lot number: EK9231, Expiry date: Apr2021) on 16Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported was She was positive, our whole family had COVID and we all came down which was about the same time which was 29Dec. Concomitant drug were not reported. Retired Nurse stated, &#34;I am calling for my daughter. She received her 2nd vaccination yesterday morning and she had some side effects. Like about 6 o&#39;clock this morning she came in, she came in 6:35, she came and woke me up and said that she felt some of the reaction she is having. She has nausea, she has slight temperature 99.7, fatigue. Just a general feeling of aches and pains. It does not seem like it&#39;s an emergency. She was treated in the ER with steroids and since that point we have all recovered until she went for the 2nd. She works in a hospital, she got her 2nd dose of vaccine like I said yesterday morning. &#34;Retired Nurse stated, &#34;I am not sure causality. I mean it is not an emergency. She was feeling fine yesterday. We all are feeling better now. She had the vaccine and last night she said she had a sore throat when I looked at her throat. Her throat seemed red but there was no angioedema or anything like that, she went to sleep and she came in &#39;feeling really&#39; (voice distortion) sick. So, I do not know. Did they have relapses from the COVID? I do not know.&#34; Treatment was &#34;Tylenol.&#34; Like I had said that she was feeling heavy with her chest. She went to the ER. She was at her work. She went to the ER.&#34; &#34;Probably close to 10 days ago, they did lab work I think they might have been looking for a clot. They did do some lab work at the hospital with unknown results.&#34; Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

                                                About 28 hours after receiving the injection, my smartwatch alerted me that I had an abnormal heart rate. Through the next hour, my heart rate increased to 105 bpm. My resting baseline is 60 bpm (I&#39;m a self-proclaimed health nut and monitor my heart rate, nutrients, etc daily.). My heart rate was elevated for several hours while I was resting and it kept me from falling asleep. My face felt like it was burning but there was no rash. At times my face felt like it was not attached to my body. My nose swelled shut but I did not have difficulty breathing through my mouth. My entire body felt hot inside but I was having chills and sweating. Even covering myself in a thin bedsheet was uncomfortably hot. I have had an intense headache since my heart rate elevated until now, and my face continues to feel tingly as well as my arms and hands at times. The best I can describe it is like the time I took amoxicillin and found out I was allergic. The only difference was I got a rash all over my body with the amoxicillin.

I also had a metal taste in my mouth. Before the rapid heart rate started, j bad chills, diarrhea and slight body aches. For about four to five hours my heart rate resting would be 60&#39;s and when a spell came on it would rise up to high 90&#39;s. It did this off and on every couple of minutes for about four to five hours. It was a very scary situation to be in: I can handle the chills, bod aches and diarrhea but when it comes to my heart rate bouncing around and taking my breath away, that was scary.

                                                Received Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wed night 1/31/21 at 5:50pm. I had no prior recent illnesses prior to getting the shot. About 24 hours later, developed fevers/chills, body aches, headaches, and fatigue, and a notable pain in the front of neck -- felt like tender thyroid. Temp was 100.3F on Thursday night 1/14. Took ibuprofen and went to bed. Next day felt fine, went to work, but symptoms returned on Friday night without fever. Symptoms persisted through the weekend without fever until Sunday AM 1/17/21 at 3:40am, I woke up with a temp of 101.7F. Went to get tested for COVID on Sunday 1/17/21 and Tuesday 1/19/21. Both times were negative (both rapid and PCR). Remained febrile on Monday and Tuesday AM. Went to urgent care on Monday 1/18/21 and was negative for flu, but provider observed the thyroid was tender. TSH was checked on 1/18/21 and was abnormal, 0.027 and FT4 was 3.20. Had virtual appt with PCP on 1/19/21, and she ordered more blood tests to evaluate the hyperthyroidism. On 1/21, repeat TSH was 0.014, and FT4 and T3 were both high. Inflammatory markers were elevated, liver function tests were mildly elevated, but thyroid antibodies were all negative. Over the course of the week after getting the shot, I experienced tachycardia, palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion with simple tasks like walking up a flight of stairs or getting up from the couch to walk to the kitchen. PCP ordered an echocardiogram to evaluate the dyspnea on exertion, but it was normal. I had radioactive iodine uptake thyroid scan performed on 2/3 and 2/4, and it was notable for markedly low 24-hour uptake, consistent with Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, or other types of thyroiditis. As of 2/5/21, I am feeling significantly better from the past 3 weeks, and the hyperthyroid symptoms have improved and flu-like symptoms have resolved. Due to possible relation to the vaccine, I have delayed the 21-day booster shot to 23 days, and plan to get it this afternoon 2/5/21.

By the evening of 1/21 I could not stop shivering as I was sweating through 3 outfits a day (this lasted 4 days).  By 1/22 my temperature was up to a 103 and I couldn?t stand more than 10 minutes without fainting/passing out.  Fever was gone by 1/25 but still have extreme fatigue/dreams where I?m almost hallucinating to this day 2/7. Did a virtual doctors visit on 1/29 where I was put on 3 days of bed rest, but still struggle to make it through a normal work day.

                                                35 yo woman with new onset pericarditis.  Possibly related to the covid vaccine - had second dose 1/13/21. There are case reports of pericarditis with the covid virus, but none so far with covid vaccine. No known covid exposure recently. Covid test on 1/24/21 (date of admission) = not detected. Or more likely presentation could be related to Humira (started December 2020 for psoriatic arthritis and had 3 doses total). There have been case reports of pericarditis with Humira. Also, pt was on a medrol dose pack for radicular symptoms after injuring her neck, she finished the dose pack on 1/17/21. Since stopping solumedrol she has had increasing hip pain and also has costochondral pain. Per H&amp;P, It is possible that weaning off of solumedrol dose pack caused a flare up in her psoriatic arthritis leading to increase hip pain, costochondritis and pleuritis and/or pericarditis.  Pt was admitted for further treatment and monitoring.

A 35-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3248), intramuscular on the left arm on 26Jan2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to seafood. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0140), intramuscular on the left arm on 04Jan2021 08:00 for COVID-19 immunization. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at the hospital. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient complained of nasal congestion, chest tightness, and diaphoresis approximately 20 mins after the second COVID vaccine on 26Jan2021 10:30. She had an allergy to seafood and stated this was what it felt like when she had an allergic reaction. The patient received one dose of Benadryl 50 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV, Solumedrol 125 mg IV, Zofran 4 mg IV and normal saline 500ml bolus. Patient became nauseated after receiving Benadryl and improved after receiving medications. The events were reported non-serious and required emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported allergic reaction with symptoms of nasal congestion, chest tightness, and diaphoresis occurred approximately 20 mins after the second COVID vaccine is considered related to the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and the known safety profile of the suspect.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

Around 9:45 started preparing for the next day (getting coffee pot ready, etc.) up until this moment I had no side effects except pain in my arm.  Then at 9:45PM I began feeling light headed, ringing in my ears and fell unconscious. I woke up on my kitchen floor in a small pool of blood and disoriented. I do believe this reaction is related to the vaccine. I DO NOT have a history of fainting. I ate food and drank plenty of water throughout the day and after my vaccine injection. Everything about my day was typical except for the vaccination and losing consciousness.

She said after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine, she has had multiple symptoms. Patient is now due for her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose today 02Feb2021. Patient did not know if she should get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and if her side effects were from the first COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient works in a doctor&#39;s office where there is a medical doctor, nurse practitioner, and several other registered medical assistants. Approximately 12 hours later after vaccine, at 2:30AM (13Jan2021), her left arm was extremely sore. She said she went to work on Wednesday, 13Jan2021, and her left arm was still really sore, but she was fine, otherwise. She said approximately 22 hours after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine, her left arm started swelling slightly down from the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection site. She said her COVID-19 Vaccine was given a lot higher than she thinks the vaccine should have been given. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site became red, warm, and itchy. Her heart rate and blood pressure shot up, and she had pretty bad shortness of breath. Patient said that the medical doctor and nurse practitioner (where she works) told her she gave herself a panic attack. She said that the medical doctor, who she works for, told her to go home, and to contact her primary care doctor if she doesn&#39;t feel better. Patient left work and went home. Patient clarified her heart rate was in the 120s, and she usually has a heart rate in the 80s. She said she was pale and clammy, too. Patient stated that she went to bed when she got home from work on 13Jan2021, and woke up the next morning (Thursday, 14Jan2021), and got ready for work. She said as she was getting dressed for work, she felt her pulse rate go up, and she became sweaty, and clammy. She said she called her work, and her boss (medical doctor) told her to take some Tylenol and rest, and to call her primary care doctor if she was not feeling better. Patient said that her primary care doctor said she was having anxiety, and started her on medicine. She said the medicine helped, but her heart rate was still 112-115. She said she noticed on Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Friday morning (15Jan2021) the lymph nodes in her left axillary (or armpit area) were swollen, and super tender. She said all the muscles in her left arm were tender, as well. She said her left arm muscles were still aching. She said she had bruising on her left arm, and noticed she had bruising (more than usual) throughout the rest of her body. She said she has no idea if the bruising is a coincidence, or if the bruising is related to receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient mentioned that her left axillary lymph nodes were swollen for a good week and a half, but the swelling improved and was gone now. She said her heart rate was still elevated at 106-110 when she last checked her heart rate an hour and half ago. She said her heart rate was elevated, even though she was sitting down doing tele-work, and she has been taking anxiety medicine. She said she was still having breathing discomfort, clarifying she could not take a big enough breath. Patient will take a big breath, and will be good for a while, but then she needs to take another big breath. She said her doctor has checked her lungs, and her lungs were clear. She said she has to take multiple, deep breaths throughout the day. Patient&#39;s last blood work was in Oct2020. She said everything was good with her blood work. She said her hormones were good, but she had a Vitamin D deficiency. For treatment, patient stated that her primary care doctor prescribed Buspar 7.5mg, twice a day. She said the Buspar 7.5mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle and did not have the NCD, Lot, and Expiration Date. She said it will be 3 weeks from tomorrow (03Feb2021) she has been taking the Buspar 7.5mg and reported everyone seems to think she has anxiety, or she was crazy. Events did not require emergency room visit but patient visited physician office. There were no relevant tests. Outcome of muscles in her left arm were tender/aching, was not recovered, for axillary lymph nodes swelling and tender was recovered in 2021, for heart rate was elevated, Shortness of breath/breathing discomfort was recovering while for other events was unknown.

My left ear has a constant feeling of fullness. I have experienced tinnitus and a persistent need to &#34;pop&#34; my ears in my left ear since, as well as bouts of vertigo. I am very sensitive to sound in my left ear, and background noise is amplified and sounds &#34;spotlighted.&#34; I have intermittently been experiencing pain in both of my calves since the injection, as well as joint pain in my hands. I have been experiencing a flushed feeling in the evening, though it is not accompanied by a fever. My muscles in my hands, feet, and legs have been cramping often, which is not a usual occurrence. I have experienced intense chest pain in what feels to be my heart. I have also experienced very vivid dreams.

                                                I started having extremely high blood pressure after never having had it before. I ended up in the hospital. I was pregnant and due July 7th and had the baby on April 7th at 27 weeks, she weighed 1 pound and 12 ounces. She is alive and in NICU at this time. I am not sure the two are related, but it happened very suddenly after the vaccine so I just wanted to be sure someone knew in case it was something that someone needed to be aware of. I went to the hospital a total of 24 days over three trips, the final hospital admittance was 14 days from April 1-14th with delivery being on the 7th. At this time the permanent damage and birth defects are unknown and we are working through everything, I am not sure what all is my own health or the vaccine, I just want to report it to help any kind of potential progress with the vaccine and ending the pandemic.

Medical history included mixed connective tissue disease diagnosed in 2019, autoimmune disorder and anxiety from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included diazepam (VALIUM) taken for anxiety, start and stop date were not reported; paracetamol (TYLENOL A) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; ibuprofen (ADVIL [IBUPROFEN]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps (arrhythmia) on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered  sob and dates for getting really winded (dyspnoea)  on Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, her heart was racing on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really winded on 22Mar2021 with outcome of recovering, for the 4-5 days after receiving her covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30am since it started on 20mar2021 with outcome of unknown, extremely thirsty on 20Mar2021 with outcome of unknown,  low grade fevers  on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, severe allergic reaction on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s on 20Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered.  Additional details were provided as: &#34;I started having a reaction within 12 hours of the shot that persisted. Four (4) days after I was at urgent care and was sent to see a cardiologist due to SOB and heart rate jumps that were happening.&#34; In the past two weeks the patient has seen the cardiologist, had ekgs and echos completed and and now is being sent to see an electrophysiologist. The cardiologist wants her to postpone the second dose until she sees the electrophysiologist since he doesn&#39;t know if this is exacerbation of something or was caused by the vaccine. She had her first dose on 19Mar2021 around 12:45PM-1:00PM in the afternoon. After her vaccine she was ok. She had actually taken a Valium before she went to get the Covid 19 vaccine because she was nervous. She doesn&#39;t know if taking the Valium before getting the Covid 19 vaccine had anything to do with her delayed reaction. She does not take the Valium every day. She woke up around 1:30AM Saturday morning, 20Mar2021 and her heart was racing. Her mother is a nurse and her mother came over the next day to monitor her. Her heart was doing lots of rapid jumps. Even going to the bathroom or getting up from the couch her heartrate would go up to the 120-130s. (beats per minute) She and her mother monitored her heart for a while and she called the clinic where she received the Covid 19 vaccine and the nurse told her to go to an Urgent Care. She does report she has an autoimmune disease and she was wondering if she was having a flare up that the Covid 19 vaccine had caused. She could not find a doctor to talk to her about it. Even her primary care doctor wouldn&#39;t help her. Everyone told her to go to an Urgent Care or the emergency room. On Monday, 22Mar2021, she tried to get up and move around but she was getting really winded. She was trying to do things she normally does like walking in her backyard or walking down the hallway. On Tuesday, 23Mar2021 she went to the urgent care. The urgent care did an EKG and told her she needed to see a cardiologist. She was able to see a cardiologist the next day on Tuesday, 24Mar2021. The cardiologist had her wear a Holter monitor to monitor her heart rate for 24 hours. The results showed that she was having arrhythmias, heart rate jumps. The cardiologist did more EKG&#39;s and an echocardiogram. The cardiologist wants her to see an electrophysiologist because of what he saw on the Holter monitor. She is asking if it&#39;s possible that she had a heart issue before and the Covid 19 vaccine brought it to the surface. She&#39;s read things online where people have had similar symptoms. Is it a side effect? She would also like to report that for the 4-5 days after receiving her Covid 19 vaccine she would wake up at that same time around 1:30AM since it started on 20Mar2021. She&#39;s unsure if she should get the second Covid 19 vaccine. Her second appointment is scheduled for this Friday, 09Apr2021. When she woke up that morning of 20Mar2021 she was extremely thirsty. She reports she does not drink alcohol because of her autoimmune disease, but the thirst she experienced felt like she had been drinking alcohol and was experiencing the extreme thirst that comes with a hangover. The first 5 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine were the worst and that&#39;s why she decided to go to the urgent care. Her heartrate hasn&#39;t improved. Her windedness had improved by the tenth or eleventh day. She can go on a walk and jump up and down with her daughter now. The windedness is lingering a little but is definitely improved. Her autoimmune disease is called Mixed Connective Tissue. She takes no medications for it. She manages it with her diet. Her mother had called her rheumatologist on call on Monday night, 22Mar2021 and asked him is there anything the caller can do or anything she can take. The rheumatologist on call told her to take Aleve.  She didn&#39;t take Aleve but she did take Tylenol and then hours later she took Advil. She does normally run low grade fevers with her autoimmune disease. The fevers are never high, usually around 99.8F never going over 100F. The low grade fevers have been occurring prior to the Covid 19 vaccine for years. She reports that after she took the Tylenol (Tylenol Extra Strength 500mg, she took 2 tablets) and then the Advil (Advil 200mg, she took 1 tablet), she felt drugged, like totally out of it. So tired she couldn&#39;t move. And she&#39;s taken those medications before and never felt like that. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: arrhythmias, heart rate jumps   on 23Mar2021. No follow-up attempts are possible; no further information expected.

The patient did not received other vaccines in four weeks. On 07Apr2021 at 03:00, the patient went to the bathroom and felt fine. She sat on the toilet and all of a sudden felt dizzy and nauseous. Next thing she knew, she woke up on the floor and had a huge bump on her head near her left eye. She passed out and hit her head on the tile in the bathroom. Her left eye was half swollen shut, her eyelid and under eye were black, was very swollen all over her head and eye and was in lots of pain. She went to the emergency room around 04:30. All tests, CT scan and blood work came back normal. She was told that it was most likely caused by the vaccine. Treatment for the events included &#34;CT scan, bloodwork, IV fluids&#34; (as reported). She was hoping that Pfizer will pay for her ER visit since the events were vaccine reactions. She reported that she was still in lots of pain and was not taking pain meds because she was breastfeeding. The events resulted to emergency room and physician office visits. The outcome of pain was not recovered. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021442302 Baby case

It was the worst the first 2-3 days after the vaccine. It has improved somewhat, but is still not fully resolved and my improvement seems to have pleatued in the past few days. It is not debilitating nor a deterrent for me getting my 2nd dose, but I felt compelled to report my symptoms as I don&#39;t see dizziness and palpitations listed as a possible side effect.

Woke Monday morning at 4am to get ready for the work and the room was spinning. Off and on for the next 4 or so hours my blood pressure dropped and I had to lay back down. Even laying down had the room spinning. It has not been consistent and has improved as the day has gone but has yet to go away.

                                                Shortly after the patient was administered a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine at around 3:05 pm on 1/07/21, the patient experienced troubled breathing, chest tightness and wheezing for several minutes.  The patient described her condition as, &#34;my throat feels like it is closing up.&#34;  An epipen was given at 3:12 pm and the patient reported improvements at 3:16 pm (four minutes after the epipen was given).  Emergency services was called and reported to the scene at 3:12 pm where they noted the patients improved condition, after the epipen was administered.

                                                - Almost immediate onset of nausea, sore throat, headache, and sensation of fast heart rate; along with feelings of mild illness (like a cold) and arm pain which is consistent with other vaccination response.   - Waited at clinic for 30 minutes as directed due to previous history of anaphylaxis to injected meds (among others). Reported feeling poorly to nurse monitoring people waiting at 30 minute mark, who encouraged waiting longer but did no further assessment. Waited another 15 minutes with no resolution or improvement. Decided to leave and monitoring staff said they could not keep patients if they wanted to leave.   - Approximately 15 minutes later (1hr after injection), took one 25mg Benadryl liquid gel as nausea/headache/fast heart rate were consistent with prior allergic reaction and not with prior vaccine response. Those symptoms resolved after 1-2 hours; the feeling of mild illness lingered for approx. 3 days more.

A 36-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK5730) dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 11:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included von willebrand&#39;s disease, narcolepsy with cataplexy, IIH (Idiopathic intracranial hypertension), HTN (hypertension), GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), migraines. Patient also had known allergies: PCN (penicillin), shellfish, IV contrast, cefdinir and bees. On 23Dec2020, patient got nerve blocks for her migraines. Throughout the day patient was cough and her face started flushing so she tooled diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). Around 22:30, patient felt like her throat was closing and she was choking. She had chest pain, chest tightness. EMS (emergency medical services) was called and patient was brought to the hospital. On 25Dec2020, patient felt like her throat was closing, like someone was sitting on her chest and chest tightness still with chest pain. Very SOB (shortness of breath) at rest. Patient went to the ER (emergency room) and received IV dexamethasone (DECADRON) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride. On 26Dec2020, patient had the same symptoms but with severe facial flushing and patient went back to the ER and was given IV dexamethasone. Patient was sent home on a maximum amount of medications. I had seen her primary care, ENT (ear nose throat centre), Allergy, ID (infectious disease), and pulmonology. Her CT (computerised tomogram) of chest on 25Dec2020 was negative along with her COVID test. Patient SOB on rest and exertion still. Onset date of the adverse events was reported as 23Dec2020, 22:30. Patient received treatment for the events included multiple medications and high dose prednisone. Lab data on 25Dec2020 included CT of chest: negative, influenza type A/B combo: negative, Covid 19: negative and nasal swab: negative. Action taken in response to the events for bnt162b2 was not applicable. Outcome of the events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship.  The clinical presentation of the events is suggestive of possible allergic reactions. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Felt like it spread through my body,  I felt a weird feeling in my chest, throat, my legs felt weak, I was light headed and my heart started to beat hard and fast. It then started to subside over several minutes. The nurse kept me for 30 minutes and then I felt ok to walk out. I had a bit of a headache and didn?t feel right the rest of the night.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

Within 10 minutes I had tachycardia (130s), high BP (160s), lightheadedness, nausea, headache, and feeling like I was going to faint. I was attended to by Ambulance paramedics. At the time of her report to her primary care provider on 1/7/2021, she was still having pretty significant side effects (headache, dizziness, and light sensitivity), enough so that I was staying home from work. These symptoms have now resolved.

Prior to the syncope, she reported hyperventilating. She remained unresponsive for about 10 minutes and was brought to the ED. There she became responsive, and reported chest pain and had sinus tachycardia episodes. She also had lower extremity weakness. This has improved per the latest neurology notes. She also had a negative EEG. Unsure if this is an allergic reaction or if the syncope was due to hyperventilation.  Patient is currently on day 3 of hospitalization.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

She was admitted to hospital for cardiac work up, and all diagnostic tests have found her heart to be normal in structure and function. Cardiology believes she experienced a vasovagal syncope with asystole. She remains hospitalized at this time for initiation of sotalol therapy; she was diagnosed with frequent PVCs approximately 1 year ago.

                                                My first dose of COVID vaccine I didn&#39;t have any symptoms (1st dose: 12/23/20). Received 2nd dose at 0800 on 1/12/21. First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

I got tachycardia (I tend to have a rapid hart beat but this was pumping pretty good). I also had some GI distress (watery diarrhea) and that lasted for a while. Later I got really weak and shaky, fatigued, that night I woke up with night sweats, and chills, woke up completely drenched, I had to change the sheets and pajamas. 5 days after the vaccine I was really exhausted, the fatigue was awful. There was also an itching sensation but no hives.

She also experienced intermittent tingling in hands and feet. Patient was evaluated by EMS in the vaccine clinic. The chest symptoms were episodic, occurring every 5 minutes and lasting 1-2 minutes with each episode. Intermittent dizziness also occurred during the chest-discomfort symptoms. Vital signs were stable and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.  Patient denied SOB, stridor and no labored breathing. Patient was transported to the hospital emergency department for further evaluation/observation. After 2 hours of observation, patient&#39;s symptoms resolved spontaneously. She discharged from the emergency department to home with family.

Then throughout the night symptoms worsened with significant body chills despite multiple layers, severe body pain and migraine trigger. In the morning felt like full-blown flu with fever of &gt; 100 F, sensitive skin painful to the touch, cold sweats, full body pains, heart palpitations (pounding heart beats and ave 100-120 bpm), and migraine level 8/10. Medication required to try to treat symptoms (metoclopramide, claritin, excedrin). Symptoms continued and did not start to lessen until approximately 30 hours post vaccine dose (18 hours post severe symptom initiation) and two doses of medication regimens. Arm around injection site also showed raised, red irritation local to the site, however, was not exacerbated throughout the symptom course. COVID call center recommended for me to see emergency care facility due to symptoms which I waited to see if symptoms worsened before deciding to not go to the urgent care center.

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 14:45 at 36-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  Medical history included Wilms tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, Kidney resection and chemo from 1986 to an unknown date, sulfonamide allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 21Dec2020. On 12Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced vasovagal syncope with asystole (hospitalization, medically significant).  The patient was hospitalized for vasovagal syncope with asystole on unknown dates for 4 days (at the time of the report). It was reported that the patient did not receive any treatment due to the events. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient experienced what was believed to be a vasovagal syncope with asystole; approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose. The patient had been admitted to the hospital since all cardiac diagnosis tests were negative for structural or functional abnormalities. The patient remained in-patient at this time for initiation of therapy for frequent PVCs, which were diagnosis about one year ago; but chose not to treat at that time, as the symptoms were not affecting her lifestyle. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac diagnosis tests: negative for structural or functional abnormalities on an unknown date.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination; and was not tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in the development of the vasovagal syncope with asystole cannot be excluded. The event is confounded by the patient&#39;s underlying premature ventricular contractions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I have had severe lymph node swelling on the right side where I got the vaccine; 24hrs post 2nd vaccination I have had a sudden onset of an extremely violent cough; My sputum is greenish/yellow brown with blood flecks; My sputum is greenish/yellow brown with blood flecks; chest tightness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 11Jan2021 15:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroidism, asthma, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, chronic allergies, gastritis, and walnut allergy. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), metformin, loratadine (CLARITINE), spironolactone, and calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 2000). The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 21Dec2020 15:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient verbalized, &#34;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related but I figured I should report just in case. I have had severe lymph node swelling on the right side where I got the vaccine. 24hrs post 2nd vaccination I have had a sudden onset of an extremely violent cough. By sudden onset, I mean I had no desire to cough and over about 30 min I developed the severe need to cough. My sputum is greenish/yellow brown with blood flecks. I&#39;ve never experienced such a violent cough with so much sudden sputum production. I am using an Albuterol inhalor to help chest tightness.&#34; Clinical outcome of chest discomfort was unknown while for the other events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a close chronological association, a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

Today upon waking tightness in chest felt intensified and continues now (evening). Midday experienced sudden vertigo and double vision lasting over a minute along with dizziness. I had already eaten lunch. Primary Dr ordered me to emergency room. Extensive testing along with chest x-ray and EKG performed. No abnormalities were found.  ED doctor said a State test of some sort would tell us if it is an actual allergic reaction or an intensive immune response. He said it would take a few days for results.  I was given diagnosis of vaccine reaction and sent home for rest. Advised to return if symptoms get worse. Tightness in chest continues at this time. Fatigue and headache have also returned.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded.

                                                Started with some nausea around noon on 1/18 that resolved, then experienced nausea without emesis and palpitations while driving to work at 1800. She describes it as feeling like her heart was racing, but also feeling like she was having large pauses in her heart rate in between the palpitation sensations. She drank a bottle of water and the feeling went away temporarily but it returned.  I am an employee, on arriving to work I noted increased shortness of breath which is unusual for me because I am an avid runner and very active. I noted the palpitations from around 1800-2000, including becoming dizzy and lightheaded during my shift which could endanger patient care, so I presented to the ED and was placed in the CCA. I had received both covid vaccines, second one on 1/11/21 and had about 20H malaise/fatigue and some expiratory wheezing which was abnormal for her but all has since resolved. I had intermittent heart palpitations and chest until 1/26

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

The events resulted in an emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment for the events included Benadryl, Ativan, Pepcid, NS Bolus and EpiPen. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient was not tested with COVID-19 post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of hives from the neck to legs, face redness and tightness in the chest, and was unable to take a deep breathe due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including physical examination with vitals and chest x-ray, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Called family member to make them aware as I tried to safely return home. Couldn?t immediately recount events or where exactly I was or where I had been.

I was extremely nauseous. Then I felt my pulse pounding through my chest and so forceful I felt it in my tongue. I had my Fitbit watch on and looked at my pulse: it was 168 BPM. I called for help. The nurses took my Blood pressure and HR. My normal BP is low - usuall 110/68. When they took my vitals it was 180 BPM &amp; 149/98. I was taken to the ER and monitored. My vitamins returned to normal within a few hours .

She screamed.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

A 36-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 20Jan2021 16:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot EH9899) on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. On 20Jan2021 the patient had headache with outcome of recovering, general malaise, muscle pain and muscle spasms in neck with outcome of not recovered, numbness in hand and arm with outcome of unknown. On 21Jan2021 the patient experienced chills with outcome of recovered in Jan2021 and fever with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, neck was very stiff, skin irritation, like achiness from wearing clothes with outcome of unknown. The patient experienced also exhausted, pain, on Jan2021 with outcome of unknown and high blood pressure (she was normally 105/60, and in the ER she was 170/101) on 23Jan2021 with outcome of unknown. Clinical course was as follows. The patient began to develop the following symptoms: headache, numbness in hand and arm, and muscle spasm in neck. The patient was working and had some patients the day following vaccination, and her headache got much worse, the muscle spasms and pain were worse, and all of a sudden she got skin irritation, like achiness from wearing clothes, and she realized she had a bit of a fever. Chills have gone away, she did not feel those. Muscle aches, especially the muscle spasms on her neck into the shoulder have not. Fever went away that day, she took Tylenol, and after she took it, she got home from work, and was better that evening from chills and fever, she has recovered completely from fever. She was in so much pain, she was feeling overall exhausted. She had headaches the day of the injection. She thought she had slept wrong, possibly the night before, so she didn&#39;t think of it, until symptoms worsened. She went to emergency room on 23Jan2021 due to severity of the muscle spasms in neck, so the doctor was worried about stenosis, or like impingement of spinal cord, but the CT scan on 23Jan2021 was negative for structural reasons, so she was prescribed a muscle relaxer and one for pain and inflammation. The patient was given Tramadol and Norophlex at the ER via injection in each arm. After receiving injections she reported that she developed a severe reaction in both arms, she cannot move her arms, it was extremely painful, like she had surgery on both sides and her neck was very stiff. Her arms were now weak, very painful, and she could not lift her arms. She has had Tramadol in the past, never had pain, but this was worse than labor. Her left arm felt like it would explode when he injected it, and now she can barely move both arms, she has not been able to move her arms, and the hospital doesn&#39;t know why, this is not a response from those medications. Headaches were the same intensity, but better from when she went to the ER. They were now a 7 out of 10 and in the ER were a 10 out of 10. When she got chills, she had an intense stiffness in her neck, muscle pain across shoulders to upper back, and it varies in intensity, she&#39;s been laying down the last day and a half, today was tolerable, but when she went to the ER on Saturday, it was so extreme she thought she had a nervous breakdown, it was a lot of pain, she didn&#39;t know if that contributed to her elevated blood pressure, or was something separate.

                                                Fainting like episodes; Blurred vision; Severe vertigo; Chest pain; Fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional reported for herself.    A 36-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot # EL8982, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Jan2021 12:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  There were no relevant medical history or concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products.The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.On 21Jan2021, exactly &#34;4 1/2 days&#34; after vaccine the patient experienced fainting like episodes, blurred vision, severe vertigo, chest pain, fatigue. The patient has been out of work since the 20th and she still had blurred vision. The adverse event resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received. The patient was not recovered from the events. She has been to the ER, cardiologist for an echography, ultrasonography of thyroids, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her head, went to ENT dr and neurologist in 2021. All blood work in 2021 came back normal as well. The reporter considered the event as non-serious. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. She had negative Nasal Swab Covid test post vaccination on 22Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of fainting like episodes cannot be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose on 05Feb2021 12:30 for Covid-19 immunisation, being a caregiver.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received flu vaccine for immunization and had side effects. On 06Feb2021 she woke up feeling unwell a few hours before reporting. Reporter and patient went for a 4 mile walk and she felt sluggish during the walk and her heart was racing, hands were shaking and she felt as if she was going to faint. When they arrived back home the reporter checked her heart rate and it was not that high and her symptoms were subsiding. The reporter would like to know if his wife should go to the ER. A few years before the patient had side effects from the flu vaccine so he was expecting her to have a reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included heart rate: it was not that high on 06Feb2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. The reporter assessed the events as not serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

                                                Moderate headache, increased blood pressure.  I was pregnant at the time of both injections. Due date was 2/8/21 but I delivered via scheduled csection on 2/2/21. Birth weight was 6lb 10oz. Delivery uncomplicated.  History of severe atypical preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome in LAST pregnancy in 2018-2019.   This pregnancy was complicated by obesity, otherwise uncomplicated.  When I developed headache, I checked my BP, which was elevated to 140/90. Talked to my OB/GYN via phone. Was instructed by healthcare provider to check urinalysis in the office in which I work, which was negative for proteinuria. My elevated BP resolved within a few hours.

The nurse on call advised me to go to the ER. I went to ER, they ran an ultra sound and all kinds of test, they said everything looked good they thought it was a Fibroid. They discharged me, and that night at 11:30pm I had a very big and fast bleed around a cup of blood and went back to the ER. That time I went to hospital because it was closer. Again they did an ultrasound and thought it was a Fibroid. I ended up seeing my OB GYN 2/8/21, she said she didn&#39;t think it was a Fibroid and sent me to get an ultrasound on 2/12/21. At that point after the bleed I had 4 days of spotting. When I went to the ultrasound they said I had a partial placenta abruption and my cervex has shortened. Since then everything has been fine.

At 15 minutes I talked with the nurse, she looked at and we talked for quite a bit what I should do but I was feeling just fine and left to go home and take benedryl. I had just left the hospital (25 mins post shot) and my throat and tongue started swell rapidly. I called 911 and the county rescue responded. My breathing was normal by then. My body has been itchy all over since then and my throat remains minor swollen. I did not get an epi shot since I was mostly okay and the EMTs were convinced I had a panic attack so I just went home.

Very weak peripheral pulses felt. Pt remained awake but very pale, diaphoretic and slightly cyanotic around the mouth. No rash, wheezing or shortness of breath. Due to low perfusion, pulse ox unable to read. Pt laid down in vehicle (at drive-through vaccine site), legs elevated. Epinephrine 0.3mg 1:1,000 administered IM and pt&#39;s blood pressure and peripheral circulation immediately improved. Transported by ambulance to local hospital emergency department.

I became light headed, dizzy, and my heart was beating rapidly.  I drove myself to an ER because I thought I was having an allergic reaction.  They kept me for a few hours but I did not receive any treatment.  The other symptoms subsided, however I?m   concerned that my left arm is still tingling.

                                                Received first dose of the Pfizer vaccination at 09:35am, about 15 mins later I began to develop petechiae to both my arms and abdomen. I had the nurses look at my petechiae that had developed, then had me sit for another 15 mins. During that time, I began to develop heart palpitations and chest discomfort. They had me sit in another room and evaluated me. My blood pressure was high in the 140&#39;s systolic, which is abnormal for me, I?m usually 110 systolic. I began to have some shortness of breath; I wasn&#39;t able to take a deep breath. I was taken to the ED to be evaluated for my symptoms. There I was asked a series of questions, they had taken an EKG and my blood pressure was 151 systolic, then was taken to a triage room. MD ran a series of blood work and was given SOLU-Medrol IV push for my allergic reaction and Shortness of breath. I was kept in the ED for about 4 hours. Labs came back normal and was prescribed 20 mg Prednisone by mouth and 25mg Benadryl by mouth to take at home. My diagnose was Allergic reaction, Initial encounter. I was to follow up with my PCP. Followed up with my PCP the following day, 3/12/21 and she had run a CMP and CBC, looked at my petechia and referring me to Oncologist/hematologist to further evaluated for my platelet count and petechiae. She wants to make sure I won&#39;t be developing ITP.

                                                This is a positive one, and I can hardly believe it. My irregular pupil dilation independent of each other, occuring for 12 years corrected itself! I swear this is not a joke. I&#39;m flabbergasted.   The longer explanation:  Something I never talk about, partially because I am scared, is an issue with my eyes that started when I was 19. I am now 36.  My right pupil will dilate quite irregularly from my left. A bright light will correct it, but then it will start again after. I&#39;ve mentioned it to eye doctors, and they brushed it off. Research only has scary answers, with no help, so I have learned to live with it.  It used to make me dizzy, nauseous, and I&#39;d lay down. But over the years I&#39;ve adjusted, and it doesn&#39;t bother me.  I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 3/11. Last night, 3/14, I became dizzy and faint.   Today, I still felt that way. I was splashing cold water on my face, when I realized, looking in the mirror, my pupils were exactly the same size! And maintained that same diameter.  I keep checking, but, so far, it&#39;s consistent.   I assume the dizziness, lack of balance, and slight faintness today is my body getting used to this, as it&#39;s been compensating for the difference for 12 years.  So, is this a positive side effect? A coincidence? The vaccine is the only recent change, and nothing else has effected this issue over the years.

She followed up with outpatient cardiology and wore a 24hr Holter monitor, further diagnosis unknown by this reporter.  Employee states she has never experienced continuous palpitations and does not report any other habit changes during  this time.

                                                Fainted; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable nurse. A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 36-years-old; Batch/Lot number and expiry date were not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient fainted on 02Mar2021 and recovered from the event on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the event.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the even onset.  More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A person on site took my blood pressure which was higher than normal. I was advised to wait longer than 15mins, but after 30mins waiting I still was not okay to leave. I had to call family to come for me, at which point the people on site told me to eat food. I was given water and licorice by the facility, my mother brought me tacos but I still felt very weak. (Weakness was not food related). I was in the waiting area for 1 1/2hrs, advised not to drive myself home, my mother had to drive me home and stayed with me. I also had trouble walking, and was helped to the car. I did not go to a hospital for these adverse reactions as I did not get a fever at any point, and wasn&#39;t exactly sure what could be done for me.  Days following the vaccine I still felt very weak, slept a lot, and felt very out of it. It took 4-5 days to return to normal.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) lot number and expiration date not provided, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 16:20 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was advised because she has been in her house so long that she is basically an agoraphobe and psychologist qualified because diagnosed with ADHD and profound anxiety at the fear of dying from COVID, anxiety and Covid-19, Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that yesterday 07Apr2021 she got her first round of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and came home and got the worst headache she ever had in her life. She states then she projectile vomited and started uncontrollably shaking. The patient stated that she was shaking uncontrollably so bad she had to take a bath. She once she took a bath, in the bath she was shaking, it was not until she raised her body temperature high enough that her body was like okay, it could let go a little bit, then she got into bed and the shaking started again. She stated she had to use her heating blanket and stayed in bed all night with it and she is still using it now. She doesn&#39;t know how she would be if she wasn&#39;t warm, she thinks the fact that she is warm, the shaking has subsided. Later, last night, around 2 or 3 the headache was piercing, her head was hurting so bad like someone was taking a nail in her left temple. If it was a stroke she would have dealt with it if she had someone there with her to help her deal with it. She has a horrible headache today. The patient stated that now it is like a regular migraine. It sounded crazy to say , but now it she stated that it was like a regular migraine, it has improved and no longer feels like she is having a stroke. The patient took two Tylenol yesterday for the headache and vomited pretty quickly after so she doesn&#39;t think she got much of it. She has not taken anything else because she does not have anything on her stomach so she does not want to take more Advil or whatever but she would like to, her head hurts really bad, she would love some pain relief. The projectile vomiting went until there was just bile. She did not eat very much yesterday. She is no longer actively vomiting, but she felt herself wanting to dry heave but feels there is nothing else to give. The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t eaten anything today so she does not know if she can keep anything down and doesn&#39;t have much water in her system. The outcome of the event headache was recovering while the outcome of other events was unknown. Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 06Apr2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3246) (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included topiramate (TOPAMAX) at 250 mg, daily (2 DF 100mg and 1 DF 50mg at bedtime) taken for migraine, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received fist dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 27Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that since the second vaccination experienced tachycardia, palpitation, shortness of breath and basically blasting of air, difficulty breathing, dizziness and weakness, all on 18Jan2021. She reported pulse keeps raising, elevating to 148-157, she had palpitation complications without doing anything straight away. Elevated pulse and tachycardia, that all started and that was very concerning, pulse went to 209 and that was when she got transported to the emergency room. The patient reported also syncope episodes, costochondritis and chest pain on Jan2021.  On 26Mar2021 the patient experienced having discoloration on her toes, numbness and tingling and that her extremities, from the knee down and both her hands and feet were cold, ice cold. The patient was transported to the hospital by ambulance three times due to the events (hospitalizations on 22Jan2021, 30Jan2021 and 25Mar2021). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Troponin, D dimer, electrocardiogram (EKG), Chest X ray, Full blood count (CBC), exercise electrocardiogram (TMT) all resulted: normal, nuclear stress test: unknown results and pulse 148-157, 209,  all on unspecified date. The patient outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the tachycardia and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.  However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

But about 5 minutes after I received my 2nd dose I got a flush feeling in my chest and then all of a sudden my heart started racing and I felt like I was going to pass out. A nurse came over and felt my pulse. After a couple of minutes my heart rate slowed down. Like I said I do have anxiety attacks but I haven?t had one for a while now. Just wanted to report what happened to me because it was a scary feeling and maybe it was a coincidence. Haven?t had it happen again.

The nurse reported similar events for herself and her daughter. This is the second of two cases.  A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) via intramuscular route administered in arm  on 13Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose (dose 1) and then via intramuscular route administered in arm on 03Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose (dose 2), for COVID-19 immunization. Patient has received both doses of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Medical history included Down&#39;s syndrome from 15Sep1984, morbid obesity and asthma since 2011 (Diagnosed 10 years ago), all were ongoing; and not a smoker/former smoker. Ongoing concomitant medications included loratadine (CLARITIN), paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL) and birth control. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 09Apr2021, the patient tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021. On the same day on 09Apr2021, the patient experienced hypoxia, fatigue, fluid in both lungs, loss of appetite and she wasn&#39;t feeling well. The patient (who had Downs Syndrome not that it matters but it is a co-morbidity/ Daughter has downs) and the patient&#39;s mother (reporter) had their second doses on 03Apr2021 which was a Saturday and her daughter ended up in the hospital on Friday 09Apr2021 and tested positive for Covid. The patient was admitted with hypoxia. The patient&#39;s mother has questions for the timelines for their infections. She doesn&#39;t know if they were possibly infected before they got the second vaccine and were asymptomatic and unknown or did they get infected when got they got the vaccine thousands of other people. The patient&#39;s mother stated that it has mostly resolved now, and they were all home. It started with fatigue and loss of appetite and she wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she took her to the doctor at 08:00 and she was at the emergency room (ER) by 08:30 and hospitalized from 09Apr2021 to 13Apr2021. The events required visit to Emergency Room and Physician&#39;s office. Treatment included Remdesivir, Steroid Injection and Oxygen. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Data Capture Aid included the following information: The patient had a positive test for SARS-CoV2. It was unknown if the patient had SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. The patient was hospitalized from 09Apr2021 to 13Apr2021. The patient was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at hospital discharge. The patient displayed clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness including Oxygen Saturation on Admission was 83% on Room Air. The patient required supplemental oxygen (including high flow or ECMO). New or worsened symptoms/signs during the COVID-19 illness experienced (including date of onset/worsening) were Respiratory: Hypoxia, Fluid in Both Lungs and Dyspnea. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19 including 5 Doses of Remdesivir starting 09Apr2021 and ending 13Apr2021. The reporter stated that she thinks they gave her a steroid injection in the ER. The event did not require the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. The patient&#39;s outcome with COVID-19 was recovering. Patient has not had a repeat test. The patient had numerous Lab work.  The patient was not a smoker/former smoker. The patient was taking medications routinely prior to the event being reported including Paxil, Claritin and Birth Control Pill. Pre-existing diseases worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection including Asthma. The patient was not treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient underwent lab test and procedures including a Covid Test: Positive on 09Apr2021. The relatedness of drug to the events &#34;Tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021, Hypoxia, Fatigue, Fluid in Both Lungs&#34; was unknown (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter/ Method of assessment: Global Introspection). Causality was unknown because she doesn&#39;t know when they were exposed to the Covid. The reporter thinks the vaccine lessened their symptoms. Reporter seriousness for &#34;Tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021, Hypoxia, Fluid in Both Lungs (medically significant)&#34; was serious (hospitalization from 09Apr2021 to 13 Apr2021). Events Fatigue and Loss of Appetite were assessed as not serious by reporter. The outcome of the events Hypoxia, Fatigue, Fluid in Both Lungs, Loss of Appetite, she wasn&#39;t feeling well, COVID-19, dyspnea and Asthma aggravated was recovering and unknown outcome for the other event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, vaccination failure of the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. Events hypoxia, pulmonary edema and dyspnea are attributed to Covid-19 infection and considered unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8737), administered in left arm on 01Apr2021 01:15 PM (at the age of 36-year-old) at single dose for so she could be protected from COVID (as reported). It was reported that vaccine was not administered at military facility and vaccination facility type was hospital (reported as patient drove up to vaccine clinic). The patient&#39;s medical history included acute lymphocytic leukemia from 1992 to 1996 and not ongoing (she was immunocompromised when she was young, she was a cancer survivor). No family medical history relevant to events was reported. The patient declined being sick at the time of vaccination. No patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported. No prior vaccinations reported within four weeks. No additional vaccines were administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient previously took gentamycin, amoxicillin and flu shot, culture specific to the flu (as reported), and she experienced allergy with all three on 1996. Patient said that she was immunocompromised when she was young, she was a cancer survivor. She said that right after remission she developed a gentamycin allergy and, because of the gentamycin and amoxicillin allergy she was allergic to the flu shot, not the flu but the egg culture, because the egg culture can be that reaction. Patient also said that she had a reaction to a flu shot back in 1996 or something, it was the same rash that was with the COVID vaccine. It was reported that patient had her first Pfizer Covid vaccine dose on 01Apr2021. She reported side effects of heavy breathing, racing heart, feeling woozy, rash, and pain at the injection site. It was reported that she would like more information and she wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. Patient had both an event to report and a question. She said she had done application, the first vaccine was 2 weeks before the present report and she was not supposed to get the second until this Thursday (19Apr2021), she needed to look at a calendar. She said 01Apr2021 was her first vaccine and that she did already report her events. She said she had a bad reaction that borderline sent her to the emergency room but she instead took a BENADRYL and she laid down and then felt really really really poor the next 5 days. She said she had a terrible reaction, she didn&#39;t feel like her throat was shut, her breathing was heavy, her voice was deep, her heart was racing, like she really had to work to breathe, not like losing her airway passage, just that she had to work to breathe, she had a heavy chest, chest pain, a racing heart. She said she could best correlate it to how feels like low blood sugar, like you are going to pass out. It was also reported that patient experienced woozy, about to pass out. She said she ended up what she&#39;d call a vascular rash. She said it started in the thighs and spread down her legs. She said it was not a rash at the injection site, the rash was under the skin rather than a topical rash. She said she had a photo of it, that it seems like a vascular reaction. She would like to file a report with us because she said she felt like she did not get anything out, she had logged what happened to them and there was no correlation, no confirmation. She said she could send the photo to them. She said she was scared to get second vaccine, she wonders if she should do her due diligence to do second dose, or if she should skip it. She said there was no protocol in place, she had a telemedicine call with her doctor, there was no $200 fee due, her physician said it sounds like patient had more than a normal reaction. She said there were other things that are scary, her doctor told her she should speak to an allergist, but she said it would cost her like $600. She said she didn&#39;t feel good on immediate injection, she felt like she probably shouldn&#39;t be driving her car. She looked for her notes then she said her only normal reaction was a super painful injection site but not a rash. She said the vascular rash subsided with the use of BENADRYL. She said she could not afford an allergist to figure out what&#39;s going on. She asked why someone as small as her would get the same dose as a 200 pound man and why the doses of the vaccine were not specific to size or weight based. She also asked if based on symptoms will someone in the medical Information department advised her not to get the second dose. Events onset date were reported as 01Apr2021. The case was reported as non-serious by the consumer. No events required emergency room visit. She confirmed that she did have a telehealth meeting with her general practitioner (also reported as no events required physician office visit), she said she talked to them on the phone. No investigations assessment and relevant tests were reported. The outcome of events was resolved on 02Apr2021 for &#34;rash/ rash was under the skin/ it started in the thighs and spread down her legs&#34; and &#34;vascular rash/ rash was under the skin/ it started in the thighs and spread down her legs/ it seems like a vascular reaction&#34;, resolved on 08Apr2021 for &#34;heavy breathing/breathing was heavy, voice was deep, like she really had to work to breathe&#34; and &#34;voice was deep&#34;, and resolved on 05Apr2021 for all other events.

She did not know if this was normal for it to get progressively worse and 2 to 14 days later. Patient wanted to know if the shortness of breath was something that can get worse, if this was a reaction to the vaccine even though it happened so many days later. Patient added it was the only thing she could think of and that her heart rate, oxygen levels, and everything was good minus she felt like she could not catch her breath. The doctor in the ER gave her anti-anxiety medicine, something with an L, but the doctor gave her that and it really seemed to help. It was kind of like, she did not know, it made her feel calm enough to fall asleep. Caller added that she has that and an salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler.

A non-pregnant 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: Unknown), intramuscularly in the left arm on 19Dec2020 at 37-years-old at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included intermittent asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: mild asthma attack on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, moderate dyspnea on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, chest pressure on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, a 4-5 cm area of induration in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, mild erythema in her left deltoid area in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown. The patient had intermittent asthma with no attacks in the past six years. Two days after the vaccination, she had a mild asthma attack when she was walking up stairs. For the past two days, she has had multiple asthma attacks, with moderate dyspnea and chest pressure present for most of the day. The patient&#39;s symptoms have been improving with her as needed (PRN) salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. The physician saw the patient in a telemedicine visit and found her to have an asthma exacerbation; therefore, prednisone was prescribed. The patient had no symptoms of viral infection and reported testing negative for COVID-19 after the onset of her asthma symptoms. The physician suspected her asthma exacerbation to have been caused by the vaccine because she had been symptom-free in recent years and she has not had a new exposure other than the vaccine. In addition to her respiratory symptoms, the patient had a 4-5 cm area of induration and mild erythema in her left deltoid area; this appeared about 1 week after she received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild asthma attack, moderate dyspnea, chest pressure. The patient, since the vaccination, had been tested for COVID-19. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

She stated she also had a headache on an unspecified date. She had a headache for 24 hours and she experienced both arms being shaky on an unspecified date. The patient stated her symptoms were similar to when she had COVID and that she did not wait 90 days before getting the first dose of the COVID vaccine since she had COVID. She was scheduled to receive her second dose of COVID vaccine on 08Jan2021. She wanted to know if she was going to end up with a bigger reaction. The patient would like to know if she should receive the second dose since she had a reaction to the first dose. The events were reported as non-serious. The event outcome was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Two weeks after vaccination, I had an increased of fatigue and not feeling well, accompained by a fever of (101.5 F) and chills, sore throat, and lethargy.  My symptoms of fever, chills, sore throat, body aches, congestion, and fatigue remained over the next few days and soon included chest pain and some increase work of breath.  With two negative Covid tests through work, it was recommended I go to see a physician, who instead sent me to Immediate Care.  There I had an EKG which showed sinus bradycardia and they sent me to ER due to my symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath.   At the ER, multiple tests were run to negative results.  ER Physician suspects that some of my struggles could be related to Covid vaccine but that I also may have caught an non-Covid virus on top of it which led to acute bronchitis.

Extremely benign -  for 24 and 25th - dull headache and arm at injection site was sore. 27th - all of a sudden I had an elevated resting heartrate - 140 - would go up and down and when it was down it didn&#39;t go to normal -  it went to 90s and my resting heart rate is in 60s.  And also had chest tightness, shortness of breath and fatigue. Went to ER  That all lasted for 10 days. Fatigue aspect got better; the heartrate slowly started getting a little better. Chest tightness and shortness of breath - even when heartrate went down a little, I was still experiencing those symptoms anyway. Off and on thing for 10 days. Last 10 days - have significant improvement. Due for 2nd dose tomorrow - dr has advised I hold off.

                                                Received vaccine approx 4:25pm.  At approx 4:50pm, while driving home, I started to feel &#34;off&#34;, like something was wrong. Part of my tongue started to feel a bit tingly and itchy. I arrived home approx 5 minutes later, and took Diphenhydramine 50mg po. Parts of my tongue still felt tingly and itchy, and the right side towards the back was starting to feel a little swollen. I decided to have EMS bring me to the hospital in case I was having an allergic reaction. EMS arrived to my house at approx 5:15pm. My BP was significantly elevated (160&#39;s/90&#39;s - I am usually 110&#39;s/60&#39;s), and I was tachycardic at approx 100-105bpm (I am usually 70-80bpm). I had started to feel like the back of my throat was tightening a little bit. I did not have wheezing or severe difficulty breathing, or generalized itching, hives, or flushing. Once on the ambulance my throat was feeling tighter, so they administered Epinephrine 0.3mg IM,  inserted an IV, and administered Dexamethasone 10mg IV. After a few minutes the tightness in my throat was gone and I was feeling more back to normal.  BP and HR began to slowly trend down (BP 130&#39;s/80&#39;sjust prior to arrival to hospital). I was seen by Nursing and a Provider shortly after arrival to the ED.  My BP was still elevated (140&#39;s/90&#39;s) and HR was approx 90bpm. Provider stated that my posterior pharynx was not swollen. I was observed in the ED for approx 2.5 hours, and was discharged to home with instructions to take Diphenhydramine as needed and follow-up with my PCP within two days. BP and HR had normalized prior to discharge. They did not do any labs or tests (12-lead EKG was done by EMS en-route). The following day (today) I am tired and have a slight headache and occasional slight nausea but otherwise feel ok.

It slowly began to progress to my legs, torso, and feet by 8:30pm.  The rash was raised, hot, and red. Blanchable to touch and extremely itchy.  I used Benadryl 50mg (taken at 8:45pm) and hydrocortisone cream to alleviate the rash. This helped until  Monday 1-18-21 at 06:00am. The rash began to return so I took another  50mg of Benadryl. The rash again cleared until 10:00am, at which point I scheduled a virtual visit through portal. I was prescribed prednisone and Famotidine. The rash continues to reappear once the Benadryl has worn off.  Today I have taken one dose of  prednisone and  a total of 3 doses of Benadryl.

I was taken to the Urgent Care who sent me to the ER because I was having throat issues.  The urgent care had given me 2 benedryls  before going to the ER.   I sat there several hours in the ER but was never seen and went home because I had begun to feel a little better.  The next day I had to take benadryl in the morning and the afternoon because I still felt the sensation where my face felt a little stiff and shortly after the symptoms began to subside. I had a little body aches and sore throat but they were very minor.

Continuing to take Atarax every 6 hours per MD order.

                                                Symptoms reported by patient  Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 @ 0950.  Vaccine was given on side of left arm.  On the evening of 1/5 I started to not feel well.  I had a runny nose, headache, nausea, and fatigue.  The injection site on my left arm was red, warm, and swollen with a knot/ball that could be felt underneath.  I also had moderate pain at injection site.  This was about the size of a half dollar.  On the morning of 1/6 I still didn&#39;t feel well.  I received a call from my mom that she tested positive for COVID and although I did not have much contact with her there was one day on 12/26 that I saw her outside for about 15 minutes (masked).  I called employee health with all of this as it was hard to separate the exposure from symptoms of the vaccine.   I did express some concerns over having a vaccine reaction but was told the symptoms I was having would be normal.  I was tested for COVID, which was negative.  Over the next few days symptoms got better but I did have nausea on and off until the morning of 1/11.  Redness at injection site, swelling and pain were resolved by 1/11 as well.  On Friday 1/15 I woke up and my injection site was red, warm, swollen, and had pain again.  This was about the size of a quarter.  There was also a hard area that could be felt under the skin.  My arm hurt with radiating pain into my wrist.  I thought maybe it was just random and it would go away.  It slowly resolved through out the day and was mostly gone by Saturday 1/16/21.  The only thing left was a faded red area about the size of a nickel.  Friday evening ,1/15, I started to not feel well with body aches, joint pain, headache, and pain from injection site that radiated to my chest (this was intermittent).  I also had a low grade fever (highest temp 99.9).  I still did not feel well on Sunday but some symptoms were improved (pain radiating to chest was better and no more fever) but still had fatigue and body aches.  I had a rapid COVID test done which was negative on the evening of 1/17/21.  On 1/18 I felt better but towards the end of the day started to feel fatigued with body aches and headache.  I contacted employee health for further follow-up.

I tested positive for COVID 12/27/2020 and experienced mild symptoms such as mild fatigue and congestion. Thinking I had recovered from COVID I returned back to work as a RN on 1/9/2021.  I was told I could still get the 2nd dose of the vaccine if I still wanted to and that I should expect side effects of possible fevers, chills, fatigue and that they can last up to 3 days. I went ahead and got my 2nd dose on 1/13/2021. By the next day I had chills and extreme fatigue. I was expecting it and thought it would go away by the next two days. By day 4 I was feeling just as bad and actually felt worse than I did when first testing positive for COVID. On 1/17/2021 I experienced shortness of breath and palpitations while getting dressed. I went to ED and was sent home. On 1/19/2021 I experienced similar symptoms while driving home from DR appointment. Went to ER again and was sent home and was told it was all post covid symptoms.

                                                lost consciousness; Severe cramping; diarrhea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient). A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number: EL3249, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 13Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic fatigue syndrome from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no known allergies. Patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12), Iron, and Vitamin D (VITAMIN D NOS); patient received these medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 14Jan2021 04:00 AM, the patient experienced severe cramping, followed by episode of diarrhea. During the cramping, she lost consciousness for an unknown amount of time. No therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events. Outcome of the events at the time of last observation was recovering. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of lost consciousness cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Moved to observation chair for further assessment and vitals check. Upon getting up to go to the new chair, was lightheaded. Vital signs taken and revealed tachycardia and increased BP beyond normal values. Prior symptoms persist. Healthcare workers continue to monitor me while sitting on chair.  Oral Tylenol for headache was given. Approximately 30-45 minutes in I feel chest palpitations and an uneasy &#39;anxious&#39; type of feeling even though I am just sitting down and staying calm. Due to all these symptoms plus the BP and HR remaining high they gave me  Benadryl 25mg IM to the right arm as well. The BP started to slowly go down after about 2 hrs as well as HR. Allowed to leave hospital vaccination clinic, while BP and HR still high, was better than the first 2 hours.   New symptoms on day 2, pain left arm at injection site and muscles, fatigue and some intermittent nausea. The symptoms continued for 3-4 days post vaccination. I monitored Vitals at home.  BP finally stabilized to my normal range around the 4th day.

It didn&#39;t improve so I ended up going to the Hospital, they did test to rule things out. I had a little bit elevated ESR,CRP and little high white count with  a left shift. They did an echo and they found pericarditis. They started me on treatment and by the next day I was pain free.

This started about 2-3 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I was taken to the back of an ambulance and treated with a shot (I believe it was Benadryl) and oxygen and then transported by ambulance to the local hospital. I was told to continue taking Benadryl and to see my regular doctor. On 02/08/2021 I went to my regular doctor and was put on a steroid (prednisone) and switched to 50mg of Zyrtec twice a day for itching on chest and throat and injection site as well as continued throat tightness.

On 03Jan2021 the patient has been tested for COVID-19 with rapid nasal swab test resulted positive. It was unknown if treatment was received. The outcome of events was unknown. Later the patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot # EL0140) at single dose at left arm on 23Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at Pharmacy or drug store. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications in 2 weeks of this vaccination included: Lamictal, Klonopin, multivitamins, D, C, B, Zinc. On 24Jan2021 12:00 AM the patient experienced extreme tiredness, chills, fever, muscle aches, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, pale skin, malaise, night sweats. No treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag. Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use. Further information like confirmative COVID 19 nucleic acid/ PCR test together with any associated symptoms are needed for full medical assessment.

                                                This is a 37 y.o. woman who developed an episode of acute self-limited hemolysis just over a week following her second injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine immediately prior to the episode for a urinary tract infection.  She had no history of hemolysis prior to this episode.  She was in her usual state of health and received COVID-19 vaccines on 12/24 and 1/14 with the Pfizer vaccine and had no serious side effects at that time.  She then developed dysuria and was seen by telehleath by her primary care physician who prescribed ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine for her for 3 days ending 1/22.  She took these and her dysuria resolved, however the day after developed what appeared to be blood in her urine.  Then in the following 2 days which were a weekend this worsened and she started feeling poorly.  She also noted that she appeared yellow.  On Monday 1/25 her boyfriend took her to urgent care and she was subsequently sent to an ER at the hospital that referred her to our hospital.  There she was evaluated for gross hematuria with no evidence of urinary bleeding and found to be anemic due to hemolysis.  Her hemoglobin was in the 5&#39;s and she received 2 units of PRBCs.  She was transferred here to Medical Center for further management.  After the initial transfusion she did not require blood transfusion and her hemoglobin continued to increase until it was 10.4 on 2/1 which was the day of discharge.  At a follow up appointment on 2/8/2021 she was recovering and feeling well.   Her jaundice had resolved.   No treatment was given from the hemolysis aside from the blood transfusion and it was self-limited.  It is most likely that her acute hemolysis was due to the phenazopyridine as this agent is known to cause hemolysis and she took it for 3 days prior to the onset of hemolysis.  She has no prior history of drug induced hemolysis and had not taken this medication previously.  As this occurred just over a week following her second vaccination I cannot exclude that is could be related to the vaccine.

                                                After my second dose of the vaccine I had typical flu-like symptoms (fever 101.5, chills/shivering, body pain, headache, nausea) yet also developed acute and severe shortness of breath. My flu-like symptoms resolved within 48 hours yet my breathing difficulties continued and worsened. I was treated in the Emergency Department on 1/12, 1/19 and 1/20 (work up negative for covid, pulmonary embolism, infection, cardiac abnormalities). It feels as though I am having intractable diaphragm spasms that are forcing my exhales out at the end of my breath cycle. I have lost 10lbs and have been essentially incapacitated for 6 weeks. I have been evaluated by head and neck (no vocal cord dysfunction), speech pathology (no swallowing difficulties), pulmonology (no lung specific issues) and am awaiting a neurology consult.

                                                I noticed achiness on right side of chest about 18 hours after vaccine. This was in addition to ache at the injection site. It progressively worsened and grew to up my side/chest to my armpit. It felt swollen and very sore and lasted about 48 hours. I googled the side effect and didn&#39;t seek medical attention.

                                                Immediately after vaccine felt flushed with high heart rate and lightheaded. An hour after, developed chronic mild headache, chronic mild lightheadedness, and chronic moderate fatigue which are expected symptoms with the immune response. HOWEVER, symptoms did not improve in 3 days and actually very slowly worsened until I couldn?t function for work about 2.5 weeks after the vaccine. At this point, the lightheadedness and fatigue were severe and headaches varied between moderate to severe, resulting in me being out of work for 9 consecutive  work days. Had multiple MD visits with tons of tests. During the time I was out, I developed severe lower abdominal pain for two days and severe lightheadedness/nausea/mild vomitting due to being nauseated with chronic headaches. OTC meds did not help much for the headaches nor other symptoms. I have never dealt with symptoms like these before and am very healthy.  At the 4.5 week mark post vaccine, these symptoms finally started to very slowly improve, VERY slowly. Tests at MD were inconclusive. I?m still dealing with chronic mild headaches, lightheadedness, and this past Friday now unusual chest pains that move location and severity.

I waited and it progressively got worse. it felt like I had phlegm stuck in my throat that I could not get out. nurses at the drive offered to call 911 but I was close enough to an Urgent care/ER that I decided to drive myself over there. they took me in, started an IV and gave me 50mg of epinephrine and Benadryl, steroids and Pepcid. they prescribed an EpiPen. They told me to continue taking Benadryl because the allergic reaction could resurface. cough is still present and I have body aches.

I noticed my vision was blurred. I couldn&#39;t see freckles on my arms that I usually can see. After 40 mins the numbness improved. On the drive home I was swept with head-to-toe numbness for about a min with the feeling like I was going to throw up and chest pain.  The chest pain continued to come and go a few times for the next 10-12 hours. I was very dizzy and very weak. My vision went back to normal about 5 hours later. But I remained dizzy and weak for about a week. I still have dizziness on and off throughout the day that I never had before though.  All those symptoms I feel like are outside of what was expected and concern me but other than that I had symptoms that I expected as well like my arms was sore for maybe 3 hours total the day after, I was tired, and had an elevated temp around 100 degrees.

                                                The patient was observed for 15 minutes in the observation area without incident.  She arose and walked to the exit and then apparently fainted on the sidewalk outside the vaccination clinic.  She was attended to by medical staff on site and because she was responding slower than expected and complained of pain on the right side of her head and weakness of her left arm and leg an ambulance was called via 911.  Care was assumed by paramedics who placed her in the ambulance where she was warmed and examined further.  She eventually denied any continuing pain or weakness (per ambulance crewman) and she was released to the care of her boyfriend / fiance.

Quickly became short of breath, cough, nauseous and dizzy. I reported my symptoms to the RN in the observation room and took Benadryl. My HR was in the 130s at that time. I then used my EpiPen. They gave me 2 puffs of an albuterol inhaler and a 2nd EpiPen before taking me to the ER where IV allergic reaction protocol was initiated ( famotidine, iv fluids, solumedrol) and a 3rd EpiPen was given along with a duoneb and iv lorazepam. My symptoms improved after the 3rd EpiPen and seems to slowly resolve over the next 48 hours. &#34;  Per ED note Patient is a 37 y.o. female presenting to the ED with shortness of breath and throat tightness.

                                                1:45 driving home, started to notice weird feeling like I had an allergy shot. 2:30 I got home and breathing was aggravated. 2 puffs of inhaler, sat down and waited. Breathing worse, 2 more puffs. Breathing not improving enough, tongue started to feel weird. Went to ER. 3:45 went to ER. By 4:45 I was in a room, saw physician at 5:45. I had a heart rate in 140s in triage, and a low BP around 90/60. My tongue continued to feel funny and started to get hard to talk. It felt heavy, but medical staff didn&#39;t think swollen. I was given a breathing treatment, Benadryl, Pepcid, IV fluids and monitored. 8:15 I was asked to walk a bit to make sure oxygen was staying up. My chest tightness was getting worse but since my oxygen stayed at 95 when walking, was discharged. As of today, I still struggle to control my breathing and have an appointment with my allergist for tomorrow. I&#39;m scheduling albuterol treatments every 4 hours around the clock and continue to take Pepcid and Benadryl in addition to my normal meds. 3/20 I developed uterine cramping, felt like I was having back labor as the result. Uterine cramping resolved 3/21 but severe soreness in back remained.

Slept for several hours and then had a bad headache causing a little bit of nausea and still very sensitive in right hip area, took more Tylenol.

                                                Started with lethargy and hot flashes, followed by extreme shortness of breath, difficulty speaking and holding up my head and keeping my eyes open. Then trembling. The local nurse at the vaccination sight reported high blood pressure, rapid pulse and seemingly extremely low blood sugar. I didn?t go to the ER because my supervisor agreed to take me home since we were volunteering at the sight prior to me receiving the vaccine. I had to keep eating every hour or so due to blood sugar seeming very low. Shortness of breath continued. Pulse rate still high as I could sleep with my head down due to racing pulse in my head. Later that night I had small bumps on my arms with no itch. Then I had extreme fatigue and muscle fatigue. I kept experiencing extreme episodes of hot flashes. I woke up in the middle of the night with a headache and uncomfortable hot flashes. I drank 100% juice and ate a few goldfish. I had mild nausea and food aversions. The next day the bumps were gone. I went to work but was sent home. I was told I should have gone to the ER but I don?t have insurance. Once home, I went through 5 hours of extreme chills unlike anything I have ever experienced. I had to cross my arms over my chest and stack on blankets to regulate. If I moved my arms for more than five minutes or pulled the blanket down, I began uncontrollably trembling. I still had trouble regulating my blood sugar on day two. It?s day three and no bumps and no chills. Less muscle fatigue as well. I am still pretty exhausted and tire easy when doing things. I did experience the common soreness in the muscle the vaccination was administered, but I figure that is normal.  I am hopeful that I am improving and out of the danger zone. I took Garden of Life Elderberry with added nutrients last night and today I took my normal detox probiotic. I have been pushing fluids and have broken my intermittent fasting to try and keep my blood sugar up. I feel like my system is finally regulating and now I just have lingering exhaustion from the events that took place.

Next, I was feeling tingling in my extremities. Then like the flick of a switch, I went into anaphylactic shock. I couldn&#39;t breathe and struggled to get the words out to get an epi pen. I was then injected with 3 epi pens while the ambulance was called. I also felt tingling in my tongue and mouth. The following day at home, I had another reaction. It started with tingling in my throat then the shallow breathing again. Chest pains again, then anaphylactic shock again. The next day, allergy symptoms came back, but not anaphylactic shock. This time, the addition of burning in my biceps on both sides, which traveled down to my forearms. Later on, the burning traveled down my torso to my legs. There is also some burning in my ears and scalp. My breathing is shallow, and it seems like when the allergy meds start to wear off, the symptoms keep coming back. They&#39;re happening now as I write this

                                                Within one hour of the shot administration I became tachycardia, hypertensive, and with chills. Over the next 48 hours my symptoms worsened to include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and near syncope requiring an emergent visit to the ER.  My symptoms persisted and two weeks  later I required another visit to the ER and was admitted to the hospital overnight due to tachycardia, hypertension, diarrhea, chest pressure, headaches, fatigue, weakness, chills, and near syncope.  Since the onset of events post the Pfizer vaccine, I have required multiple visits with MDs/specialist for management of symptoms and course of treatment.  My local physician suspected postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) of which I seeked medical opinion and met with a world expert and after meeting with him, he concluded my symptoms were in fact in line with POTS.  Since then I have continued to experience flare-ups and episodes of tachycardia, most recently 4/14/2021.  It has now been over 3 months since the onset of symptoms post vaccine and I continue to require treatment and management of above symptoms.  I have not returned back to previous level of function nor have I been able to return to work.  I do not have any prior medical history of this condition or set of symptoms.

A 37-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN5318) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 37-year-old, on 04Feb2021 16:30, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines 4 weeks prior. Concomitant medication included ongoing drospirenone, ethinylestradiol (DROSPIRENONE/ETHINYLESTRADIOL) taken for contraception.  The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EL3302) single dose, at the age of 37-year-old, on 14Jan2021 1500PM in the left arm, for covid-19 immunisation and experienced fatigue and a sore arm. On 05Feb2021, the patient experienced fatigue, sore arm, mild chills, and body aches. On 08Mar2021, the patient was hospitalized because of vertebral artery dissection after an intense workout that morning/ she tore a vertebral artery in her neck which she immediately clotted and led to her having a stroke. The patient had vertigo, nausea and weakness on 08Mar2021 and went to the ER and they found she had a thrombolytic stroke in the cerebellum as a result of the vertebral artery dissection. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 08Mar2021 then she was discharged 11Mar2021. While she was in the hospital, they did an MRI and found two sub-acute thrombolytic strokes or blood clots in her brain. The patient tore the artery in her neck which led to the right cerebellar stroke; her blood was really clotty but they could tell by the imaging that the two subacute blood clots that led to having the other two strokes were there approximately three weeks before but not much older than that (without exhibiting symptoms, so she had three thrombotic strokes in total). Since she was discharged she has been out of work and will be on FML for two to three months and going to physical therapy from the effects of the strokes. Adds while she was in the hospital they were trying to determine the cause of the two sub-acute strokes that were unrelated to the dissection. They did several tests including: EKG which was normal; TEE scope down her throat to look at her heart which was normal; and blood work to check for a clotting disorder which was also all normal.  So far nothing has been found. Outcome of mild chills, body aches, and sore arm was recovered on 06Mar2021; outcome of vertebral artery dissection and right cerebellar stroke was recovering; while it was unknown for the other events.

                                                I was 5.5 weeks pregnant when I revived the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Everything was seemingly going fine with my pregnancy until about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine when I went to the bathroom nd wiped and saw pink discharge on the toilet paper. I then began to have mild low abdominal cramping. The abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding steadily increased in severity over the next 24 hours until I eventually had an obvious miscarriage the evening of  12/31/2020.  I cant help but think the vaccine in some way caused my body to reject the pregnancy.    Along  with the miscarriage, I also had extreme tiredness with GI upset 12/31/20 - 1/02/2021.

                                                I felt fine after the shot all day. I went to bed at 1030pm, woke up at 1130 hyperventilating (respiratory rate was 40&#43; and I couldn?t lower it),  shaking uncontrollably (felt increasingly cold, though my temp was normal; my skin was cold to the touch but I felt like it was burning off), tachycardic (heart rate was 140bpm and I normally am at 60-80 at rest). My throat felt like it was closing and my face was swollen. I should have gone to the ER, but I wasn?t thinking clearly and didn?t know what to do with my small children.  It took 2 hours until I stopped shaking, my heart rate returned to normal, and my breathing was under control.  Since then I have mainly been fatigued, taking Tylenol for overall aches, and have not been able to tolerate much activity (can only stand for about 5 minutes at a time).

                                                I felt weak and with muscle fatigue the day after the shot. Also had a headache and neck muscle tension and mid back muscle tension. Joint pains as well. These subsided after 48 hours except for the neck and upper back muscle fatigue and mild soreness. This gave me a low grade headaches almost daily since the vaccine. I took ibuprofen a few times which helped. On the 6th I awoke at night and felt weak all over. I felt like I was falling in my bed. Mild dizziness.  I went to work and felt extremely fatigued with muscle weakness but no neuro deficits. I feared some terrible autoimmune illness and took Decadron that day- 4mg tab BID. This helped my muscle weakness but left me with insomnia. The decadron is now wearing off after 4 days and I still have muscle weakness/fatigue. It takes considerable effort walking up the stairs. Yesterday my masseter muscles became fatigued with little chewing. My arms feel heavy when I lift them. The strange thing is that at night when I lie down I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is being triggered. I will get palpitations and feel just strange- I can&#39;t describe it.  I took valium to sleep last night -5 mg tablets that my doctor gave me Saturday as there seems to be an anxiety panic component going on. I have no history of diagnosed anxiety or panic attacks- I have never felt this way before. Today I feel a little better but still have considerable muscle fatigue and neck and upper back muscle soreness and overall muscle tightness in my arms and legs- feels good to stretch kind of feeling. I have mild dizziness when standing up and turning too abruptly. But no considerable focal neuro deficits.

Immediately after receiving the vaccine, patient developed lightheadedness, flushing, hives, wheezing and throat swelling.  Patient was treated in an emergency department with epinephrine, gradually improved and was able to be sent home with an EpiPen, prednisone, hydroxyzine, and famotidine.  The next day, patient again developed shortness of breath and her husband administered the EpiPen.  EMS arrived and gave another dose of IM epinephrine and IV diphenhydramine.  On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was altered, diaphoretic, tachypneic, tachycardic, and stridulous.  Patient was given multiple doses of IM epinephrine and started on epinephrine drip.  Stridor continued and was unresponsive to nebulized albuterol.  Patient was then intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.  Other treatments included solumedrol, pepcid, magnesium sulfate, nebulized epinephrine, and IV fluids.  admitted to the intensive care unit, weaned off epinephrine drip, and extubated the next day.  Patient was monitored on hospital floor for one additional day and was then discharged with no residual symptoms.

Experienced difficulty sleeping the rest of the night due to symptoms and restlessness. Following day, I continued to have fever averaging 100 degrees F, body aches, chills and headache that brought me to tears. That evening, began experiencing severe nausea and involuntary shaking. Reported to ER for management of symptoms. Received fluids, ibuprofen, Zofran and Reglan as well as potassium. It is currently the following Monday so 5 days post vaccine and I continue to have intermittent nausea and headache.

I had a temperature of 99.1. I went to an urgent care and my BP was elevated (very unusual for me) 140/100 and HR 110 and temp still 99.1.  They did a rapid swab on me that was negative. I continued to feel awful the rest of the day. On Sunday the next morning I awoke because I had a very swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit. I took tylenol and did warm compresses. I had continued fatigue on Sunday and slept the whole day. I also continued with a high heart rate 110-130 with activity. My Bp was 117/70I had a pulse oximeter at home. My temp stayed 99.  Monday morning I woke up feeling better. My HR was in the 80 and temp 98.3 and fatigue is gone. I still have mild soreness in my left arm but the redness is fine and warmth is gone. My left armpit is still sore

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart began to race and I became very warm and sweaty. I was brought into another room for monitoring and my heart rate was above 100. After some breathing exercises, it came back down to the high 70s for a few minutes but then increased again into the 90s, at one point it was 113. My chest and throat then began to feel tight and I began sweating again. My face also felt funny on my right cheek. At that point I was first given 25 mg of benedryl then epinephrine. I was then taken to the emergency room via ambulance and was observed for approximately an hour. I was given an additional 25 mg of benedryl and discharged at 4:55pm. I was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and prescribed 25 mg of benedryl every 6 hours over the next 24 hours. The following morning, I experienced a hot flash with profuse sweating followed by chills. I was very tired and felt feverish throughout the day on 1/12 and stayed home from work. On 1/13 I still felt tired but was able to work. Today I feel mostly normal but still occasionally have had heart palpitations.

A 38-year-old female patient received the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at 38-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood clotting disorder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: my heart rate, I was like in AFib (medically significant) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, very high fever of 103 (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, dizzy, light headed (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, arms sore (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, exhausted like an extreme fatigue (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered, palpitations (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered.  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated, &#34;the day after the shot I got a very high fever of 103. I was dizzy, lightheaded. My heart rate I was like in AFib, it was going from 60s to 50s all over the place. And this was the next day after the vaccination. That evening nothing my arms was just sore. But the next day all of these side effects just started in and even still today I just feel so exhausted like an extreme fatigue and I am still getting like palpitations.&#34; The patient stated, &#34;So I went to urgent care and they check my vitals and stuff and when they wanted me to send me to the hospital. But I told them I will get a ride and I go by myself just because I didn&#39;t want, capable of an ambulance ride and I ended up just going home because I couldn&#39;t get a hold up anybody. So, I came home and took my blood thinner medication because I do have blood clotting disorder.&#34;  In regard to the outcomes of the events, the patient stated, &#34;I am not experiencing all of them still definitely my heart is much better. I am still getting palpitations but nothing near how it was that first day. I am experiencing extreme fatigue.&#34;

                                                I started feeling lightheaded, heart started beating fast, and I briefly felt like I might pass out. I raised my hand to tell the nurse, and she asked if I wanted to see the EMTs which I replied yes. I was able to walk to the EMTs with no issue, as the lightheadedness had subsided (felt lightheaded for maybe 1-2 min total time). The EMTs took my blood pressure and it was 160/100, with a high heartrate (they didn&#39;t tell me what that was). They gave me some water and I sat for a few minutes, starting to relax and feel better shortly thereafter. They took my blood pressure again, and it was down to 140/84 and they mentioned that the heartrate had gone down significantly as well. At that time I felt fine, and they felt I was ok to go home.

I felt it in my stomach, head, hands, all over.   I told the workers that I didnt feel well.  They moved me to the bathroom and propped me up over the sink sitting in a chair.  I felt very lightheaded at that point and somewhat responsive but was feeling very bad.  I looked at my iwatch and my heart rate was 198.  I felt lightheaded like I was going to pass out.  They had me move to the floor to prop my feet above my head.  They checked my blood pressure and it was normal.  I had them get my purse with my Xanax.  I took 1.5 tablets of .25mg Xanax.  My heart rate slowly went back to normal around 80BPM after about 15 minutes.  The rest of the day I felt very tired.  I felt normal again at 8pm with bo further side effects.

She said she wasn&#39;t sure if she became tachycardic because she was worried when she became dizzy. She said the tachycardia resolved with the dizziness. No treatment was received. The events stared from 05Jan2021 and considered as Medically significant. The outcome of the events was recovered on 05Jan2021. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. No Vaccine Administered at Military Facility. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. No AE was require a visit to: Emergency Room or Physician Office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Relevant tests was none.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of dizziness and tachycardia.

                                                The day following the 2nd vaccination dose, I had zero symptoms other than a slightly sore injection site.  Around hour 30 following the vaccination I began to feel warm, and I got up to brush my teeth and cool off in the bathroom.  As I was brushing my teeth, I started experiencing an increasing ringing noise in both my ears that I thought was strange and somewhat alarming, but I didn&#39;t feel any signs of dizziness or dysphoria.  The next thing I remember is waking up the bathroom floor with my husband standing over me.  Apparently I experienced a complete lose of consciousness and feel to the floor, hitting my chin on the bathroom vanity as I feel and splitting my chin open, which I have zero recollection of.  My husband states that when he found me, that my eyes were open, but I was staring blankly at him with a glazed over look and my whole body was limp and diaphoretic.  I came too in about 30 seconds after he found me, but I was very confused, not making a lot of sense, and felt very disoriented and weak.  It took about 20 mins for my fever to break, and to have the strength and power to get up and walk to bed.  We changed all my clothes because I had soaked through them, and he got me into bed after cleaning/bandaging up my chin.  I then slept solidly until noon the next day, which is very unlike me, but since then I have felt relatively fine with no other experiences of fever/chills/disorientation, just some continued mild fatigue off and on.  After discussing with my nursing colleagues, they all had similar experiences around hour 24-30 post 2nd vaccine with fevers, chills, restless sleep, or just general malaise, but no one experienced a complete loose of consciousness, so I reached out to my PCP yesterday, and she confirmed today that I should report this to VAERS.  I have never experienced any form of loss of consciousness/fainting/black-out/syncope prior to this, which is another reason I thought it was important for me to report this.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID). On 11Jan2021, within about 10 minutes of getting the vaccine she reported that her heart began to race and she became sweaty and uncomfortable. After another 5 minutes or so she began to have difficulty breathing as her chest and throat felt very tight and restricted. She also became lightheaded. Her heart rate was over 100, then dropped into the 70s, then shot back up over 100. Her face had a weird sensation as well. She was given Benadryl first and then epinephrine and had to go to the emergency room via ambulance for observation. She was released after an hour and had to take Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 24 hrs and diagnosed with an allergic reaction. On 12Jan2021,  she had a hot flash upon waking up and felt generally under the weather all day. Her arm was very sore at the injection site. She missed a day of work due to the whole ordeal. On 13Jan2021, she felt more normal but still have some tightness in her chest with a fluttering feeling. The outcome of event diagnosed with an allergic reaction was not recovered; for other events was recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known product safety profile, causality between event allergic reaction to vaccine and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 38-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 20Dec2020, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine last 20Dec2020. On her first shot, she did good the first couple of days but had a sore arm in Dec2020. However, on 24Dec2020 while at work, her heart started beating really bad/heart beating fast and she had tachycardia/palpitations for 45 mins. She then mentioned she was a nurse and that the doctor hooked her up to a monitor and her heart rate was in 130s - it was sinus tachycardia on 24Dec2020. She informed that she had filed a report with the CDC. She went to the emergency room and her heart rate was 100-150 on 24Dec2020. She got fluids and her labs looked good, labs were normal on 24Dec2020. The only thing on 24Dec2020 was her TSH was high/ slightly elevated but her T4 was normal. Then she took it easy the next day. On Saturday, 26Dec2020 she began experiencing chills and took Tylenol and; her heart started beating fast again. She went to the emergency room and they repeated the labs, and everything was normal on 26Dec2020. Her TSH was higher than before on 26Dec2020. She went to see her doctor and the doctor thought that it was from her drinking a lot of caffeine before the vaccine and then her body building up antibodies days later. She was going off on tangent and unable to clarify details. She wanted to know if there was any data between the vaccine and the thyroid. Her doctor &#34;feels like safe&#34; and she had sinus tachycardia. She was asking if there were any reports on elevated TSH and tachycardia as a vaccine side effect. She further informed that she was trying to decide whether to take her second shot or not. She wanted to know if it was safe to take her second shot. Her doctor said it would be fine, but she wanted to know what Pfizer has to say. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

They had me lay on the gurney and checked my pulse ox. My heart rate was 147 but my Sp02 100%.  After about 30 mins or so it naturally came down with no medical interventions.  Otherwise for the first dose my only other reaction was expected fatigue, injection site soreness and mild headache.   Of note - I did go ahead and get my second COVID19 vaccine after consulting with medical professionals on 1/24 and did not experience any chest pounding tachycardia. Maybe mild tachycardia but I was also nervous due to the previous first inject reaction.

A 39 years old female patient (no pregnant) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EH9899), intramuscular on 16Dec2020 10:15 at the first single dose at right arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease.  Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3 1000).  The patient experienced rught MCA stroke on 25Dec2020 06:15. Seriousness criteria reported as hospitalization, life threatening. The patient was hospitalized for rught MCA stroke for 3 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 25Dec2020.  The patient received unspecified treatment  for rught MCA stroke. The outcome of event was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The subject had medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease.  The reported stroke was more likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

She went to the hospital the second time for chest pain that woke her up on 11Jan2021. It started at like 3AM. She thought it was heart burn. She tried to go back to sleep. It continued while she was at work. She told her supervisor who sent her to the hospital. They did not admit her. They did do an EKG on 11Jan2021 and it was abnormal, but not indicative of heart attack. Thought it was gastritis. Her doctor thought the heart attack was on the 02Jan2021. The same thing happened with her heart and she had a heart attack in Apr2019. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient stated she didn&#39;t go to the ER, but called doctor&#39;s office on the following Monday. There was no adverse event following prior vaccinations. Outcome of event chest pain was recovered with sequel, and outcome of other events was unknown.   Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in the development of the events chest pain and heart attack cannot be excluded.

They dropped to 44k, but I presume they may have been even lower before I had my blood drawn because I had uncontrollable nose bleeds and bleeding. My Chronic ITP had been in remission and at &#34;safe&#34; levels since May 2014 and so my doctor and I both presume the COVID vaccine triggered my platelets to drop. I wanted to sure you were aware this could occur for people with a history of platelet blood disorders.

                                                I developed tachycardia at rest exactly 2 weeks after having the second dose of Pfizer vaccine. My heart rate while resting was 100-115 and increased to 130s-140s with standing or walking. I went to the emergency department at hospital. They observed that my heart rate was in the 135-140 range sitting in triage. I received some fluids and was discharged after it was determined there was no clear life threatening reason for the tachycardia, but my heart rate remained unusually elevated - sometimes up to 115 while siting and rising to 120s-130s with any physical activity for about a week after this event. It seems to be gradually improving at this time, but workup is still in progress.

                                                With the second dose my symptoms started late evening on 01/13/2021. I started feeling bad, but finished my shift. Felt drained, headache to start. By next morning (01/14) I had fever (101.5F) and the whose body aches, nausea, diarrhea, horrible horrible headache, like a migraine, severe congestion, runny nose and some days later I started having an earache on my right ear. I would like to mention I also had a vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor that started with the first dose and had not resolved by the time I received the second dose and this time the odor is much stronger, it is awful, I already made an appt with my GYN. The odor got much stronger about a week after the second dose. I kept self medicating at home with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, but the fever would return as soon as the dose was weaning off. The 101.5F fever lasted for about 9 days.  I also experienced shortness of breath from 01/14 until the 22nd and I never had to use my rescue inhaler before. I had to use it and had to even call for a second one. I am very athletic and active and never need it even after my runs and workout activities. I consulted with my PCP on the 19th and again she gave me a covid test. Negative. She diagnosed me with inner ear infection (right ear). Prescribed me Levaquin and in 2 days I was much better. On the 22nd I finally started seeing the symptoms subside and started feeling better.  Also, I wanted to tell that I had a gas pain episode that almost sent me to the ER. My chest, my left shoulder hurt really really bad. I called a friend who is a physician and he told me to take some gasex first and if that did not work to go to the ER. Fortunately it worked. But the pain was excruciating.

                                                I began having headaches nightly 2 nights after my second dose. On 2/7 my blood pressure was about 135/90. On 2/9 my blood pressure was 150/90 or 95 and then it increased by the time I went to my doctor?s office that afternoon. I had severe pre eclampsia on 2/8 and was induced and delivered 2/9 with a 34 week old baby. She had an infection and pulmonary hemorrhage.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I started to have a very mild headache. It felt like a pressure headache. I took Motrin. About 6 hours later that was gone. That night, about 8 hours after vaccine, I began to have muscle aches - whole body. I was very sore. I went to bed. Next day, I had severe joint and muscle aches and pains. The Motrin did not help that. Ice did not help, heat did not help and rest did not help. No headache. I wasn&#39;t red in face etc. Over the next week, I the muscle aches and joint aches were varying between moderate to severe. Some days it did restrict my activity completely. It started to get better week two - but still moderate to severe. I had some abdominal pain on upper left side and my right side (upper, as well) The upper right side pain would go away with ice but the upper left side wasn&#39;t helped with that. The only thing in those two weeks that helped was Celebrex (Motrin stopped helping). After two weeks - around 2/5/2021, I saw my Dr - a virtual visit. He told me to double up on the dose of Celebrex to help with muscle aches, joint aches and right side abdominal pain. Heart palpitations - irregular heartbeat. On 2/7/2021, I took a test for COVID and it was negative.  The joint and muscle aches were moderate to mild the third week. There was no more abdominal pain in third week. Week 4 - mild joint and muscle aches - only a few days that week and that was it. Last week was the first week where I had a few days that were fine. And this week, I have been completely fine. Had general malaise for three weeks solid. And now it&#39;s gone.

She received second dose 1/13/2021 at 0813 and had no side effects. Around 1500, she developed chest pain and wheezing. She used her albuterol inhaler (pt has asthma), which helped. That night, she developed a sore arm.  She woke 1/14/2021 around 0100-0200 from pain and was unable to go to back to sleep. She had aching in her left arm, as well as shooting pains through her arm and into palm. She took APAP 1000 mg PO x 1 and doxylamine which helped, but she was still unable to go back to sleep d/t pain. The pain expanded into her chest (especially with deep breaths), and upper back. She developed headache, sore throat, sweats and chills, shooting pain in her ear, painful and swollen left axillary lymph node, and the right side of her tongue became numb (numbness subsided after 1-2 hours). 1/14/21 morning, pt has persistent left hand pain, as well as joint pain in her feet, hips, and knees. She took another 1000 mg of APAP, which helped her pain. by 1/14 evening, she took 1000 mg APAP again and was able to sleep, although pt still endorsed sweats/chills.  1/15: Pt reports her pain is better, less severe, though now she is very fatigued and feels like she has been &#34;hit by a truck&#34;. Her left axillary lymph node is still painful and swollen, but less painful than before.

This was confirmed many times by EKGs and lasted 4.5 hours with HR ranging from 8-173 at rest. I was given a medication, Diltiazem 30 mg tab, and my heart rate regulated. Many tests were completed at ER and so far, no known cause for this event has been determined based on test findings. So symptoms lasted from 5pm to 9:45pm. Given medication which resolved the Afib. Stayed at ER running tests until 3:30am.

EMT at site was not  alarmed.  My heartrate decreased, and after my waiting time was over, I went home.  After getting home and sending pictures of rash and list of symptoms to an allergist, I was told to take a double dose of liquid Benadryl and a dose of oral steroids.

Then, per patient: &#34;Almost 2 weeks to the day after getting my first shot, on Friday 2/26, I suddenly and unexpectedly went into Rapid Ventricular Response atrial fibrillation. I was admitted to the ER department at Northwestern. I was there 10 hours and multiple tests were completed. At this time, no causes have been found that would have contributed to my going into RVR A-fib.  I am wearing a heart monitor for 2 weeks and will undergo a stress echo exam on my heart.  I do not have a cardiac history.&#34;

                                                Immediately felt dizzy/woozy. Within 1 minute felt extremely hot and a bright red, splotchy rash appeared all over my chest, neck, face, back. Jaw and tongue felt tingly, but not unsure if that meant swollen. Medic checked heart rate and BP which were elevated. HR was in 120&#39;s and BP was 140&#39;s/80&#39;s for a prolonged period of time. Doctor gave Benadryl which seemed to help. Doctor and Medic watched me for an hour. Rash mostly went away within 5 hours, however once I came home, I noticed it had also been on my legs.  The rash never produced hives, but the Doctor onsite confirmed this was an immediate allergic reaction, and said to see my regular doctor and an allergist. Since the shot some flushed look has come back in spots each day for a short period of time (maybe 10 mins or so). Still taking Claritin.

Patient started reporting fast heartbeat about 10minutes after and we concluded that it might be because she was anxious and continued to observe pt. However, she started feeling foggy, tongue felt numb, and throat started to hurt as well. Pt was not able to clarify whether her throat was closing up. Due RPh professional  judgement, she gave pt EpiPen 0.3mg injection on Left thigh considering pt history and called paramedics. Pt was seen by paramedics at the pharmacy and brought to ER/urgent care for treatment. Called patient several hours after, and she is currently fine at home.

I let the staff know and they hoked me up to blood pressure monitor and monitored heart rate. My pulse was high at about 103bpm. My blood pressure got as high as 155/84, I believe. I was feeling very uneasy and not like myself. Luckily about twenty minutes later, these symptoms went away. I did not check these two things again, but I felt better.

I was woken up out of dead sleep a little after midnight the night I received the vaccine and my heart was racing again and lasted about an hour. The next day I just felt off but nothing specific. By 3 PM the next day I felt fine. I tried to stay as hydrated as possible and used cold compresses while my heart was racing.

                                                Approx 7 hours after receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped significantly. I had an overwhelming feeling as if I was going to pass out and had a pins &amp; needles feeling in my face. I checked my bp and it was 102/70. Over the course of about 40 minutes it slowly went back up and was at 136/84 the last time I took it last night.  I reached out to my pcp to let her know and to see if getting the second dose was safe. She confirmed she believes it was a side effect of the vaccine, but it was safe to get the second dose in 3 weeks.

The patient medical history included five weeks postpartum; concomitant medications were not reported. On 19Mar2021 the patient experienced bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery that was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. These events required doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and were described as follows: patient was five weeks postpartum and was exclusively breastfeeding the newborn. Her body was no longer expelling lochia/blood after the fourth weeks postpartum, however, the day after the vaccine, she began bleeding heavily. This continued on for four days. Her midwife said that ovulation and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. She didn&#39;t attribute to the vaccine until researching on a postpartum message board on What to Expect that there were other anecdotal claims of similar experiences. She would love to speak with someone about what this side effect could possibly mean for her future reproductive health and that if her newborn son.No treatment given; patient was recovering from bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021331585 baby case

A 38-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age of 38-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) on 31Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. The event resulted in the Emergency room/department or urgent care. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of both events [rivaroxaban (XARELTO). The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug profile and available information it  is unlikely that the reported deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary  embolism were causally  related to BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent  medical  conditions.   Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                After initial dose of vaccine, eczema patch begun spreading up my arms (had only previously had it on my hands).  Some mild lymph node swelling and general fatigue between the first and second vaccine dose. After the second dose I had severe lymph node swelling (up to a baseball size lump under my arm). Within a week of the second dose, I was treated for a sinus infection (though had no symptoms such as congestion) with antibiotics and steroids. After going off steroids, the eczema rash that had occurred after the first shot cropped up again and spread from my scalp to my knees and was extremely itchy. I also had painful, swollen lymph nodes from my ears to collar bone. I was not wheezy, but was coughing and had a tight feeling in my chest frequently. I had to do 2 rounds of steroids, increase antihistamine doseage, and begin a steroid cream (topical). I also had to decrease my immunotherapy doseage significantly because I had more severe responses to my injections. My skin finally cleared after about 4 months though I am still having to take increased medication dosages and decreased immunotherapy doseages.

                                                I developed immediate flushing, sweating, rapid heartbeat (was around 110bpm, is normally around 75bpm), and lightheadedness.  I sat down and had a few sips of water.  Within a few minutes, I felt like I was having a difficult time getting a good breath in.   I raised my hands over my head and took slow deep breaths to try and keep my breathing  under control.  I stayed at the hospital for about 45 minutes, over which time I had a few bites to eat and some water.   The flushing and sweating resolved within that time.  The lightheadedness and &#34;feeling of doom&#34; lasted about 3 hours.  I had no anxiety going into this vaccine, nor have I had a reaction like this before.

A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 24Dec2020 at 08:00 AM in the hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, has no known allergies, had no other medications in two weeks, and did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. At 3:00 PM of 24Dec2020, the patient developed a severe tachycardia with no other symptoms. She walked herself to the ER (Emergency room/department or urgent care), was nervous and kind of shaking. By the time they got to her, her heart rate was stable and was at 88. Transient tachycardia was at around 120-140 for 7 minutes and resolved with no intervention. Basic labs came back normal. She got discharged from the ER. The patient didn&#39;t think they reported it but she was willing to cooperate in any way. The patient was not treated for the adverse events. As per the patient, she reported her adverse reaction (after the 1st dose) on the website as recommended. She experienced &#34;very fast heart beat 8 hours after receiving the vaccine&#34;. The patient was inquiring if she would be contacted after. The patient also asked if the very fast heartbeat was related to the vaccine because the reaction did not happen right away like usual, she was not sure if it was an allergic reaction since it happened 8 hours later. Outcome of the event &#39;Tachycardia&#39; was recovered in Dec2020, while for the other events was unknown. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

                                                heart rate spiked; difficult to catch breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 18Dec2020 (at the age of 39-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, depression, acid reflux, and COVID-19 (prior to vaccination). The patient has no known allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications, within two weeks prior to vaccination, included sertraline (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), omeprazole (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), liothyronine sodium (T3), and levothyroxine sodium (T4). The patient experienced heart rate spiked and difficult to catch breath on 20Dec2020. The events were reported as non-serious. The clinical course was reported as follows: In Dec2020, the heart rate spiked to 194 when running outside and it was difficult to catch breath, so the patient ran/walked the 3 mile route. The heart rate spiked to 183 during a strength training workout and to 148 during a low impact weight training, which is unusual for the patient (as reported). The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of heart rate spiked and difficult to catch breath was recovered in Dec2020. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

I vomited about 6 times that day and had diarrhea. Next morning, my face was flushed. I had a low grade fever of 99.5, and checked my BP. On my home machine, my pulse was 135. I decided to go to the hospital. My Apple Watch measured my heart rate to be 150 at one time. At the ER, I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia and dehydration. I was placed on oxygen as my levels were between 90-93, and I was given IV fluids. I have felt fatigued since then, some nausea, and mild diarrhea still.

                                                After taking the vaccine, the next day, I cut my finger while making a salad and I bleed for a long time.  It was like 3 1/2 hrs my finger bleed.  It seemed unusual but nothing I couldn&#39;t handle or out of control.  I just wish they had informed me so I would have taken extra care when handling the knife.  I&#39;m not sure if this was related to the vaccine but I had never bleed that long before so I wanted to report it as a potential side effect.  I still think benefits of vaccine outweigh risk involved with vaccine so I am glad to have had the shot.

I didn&#39;t have any other symptoms during my 15 min observation period, but when I got to my car to leave the hospital, I had another episode of dizziness that lasted a couple minutes and then stopped. I didn&#39;t have any other incidents of dizziness, but started feeling fatigued and had chills that afternoon. Tuesday evening I had a slight fever, diarrhea, tachycardia, and palpitations. Over night I developed body aches.  Most of the symptoms were pretty much gone within 24 hrs, but the fatigue and tachycardia lasted into Friday. My heart rate was consistently 115-125 bpm from Tuesday evening through Friday.

                                                ~2wks following first injection, noticed a left submandibular lymph node swelling/tenderness. Following first injection, had occasional transient headache, lightheadedness. ~4 days following the second injection, had an episode of elevated resting and active heart rate for ~1.5hrs. (Normal resting HR is 60-70s, during episode was 100-110s with increase to ~140 with short walk). Following second shot, also had axillary lymph node discomfort, transient on/off headache, lightheadedness, chills, fatigue. My submandibular lymph node has not resolved but HR issue has (why reported as ?no? below).

                                                Internal brain bleeding 10 days after 1st dose covid vaccine; Brain damage; confused; suffering memory loss; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician (patient). This 39-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 18Dec2020 14:30 at single dose (lot number: EJ1685) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. The patient experienced internal brain bleeding and brain damage on 30Dec2020 07:30 after 1st dose covid vaccine. Brain surgery received on 29Dec2020. Events were still recovering. Patient was confused and suffering memory loss on 30Dec2020 07:30. Events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Prolongation of existing hospitalization (vaccine received during existing hospitalization), Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. Days for hospitalization was 16. The patient received treatment for events as brain surgery due to internal brain bleeding. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination, no COVID tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported internal brain bleeding and brain damage with confused and memory loss more likely represented intercurrent disease, and less likely causally related to 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had very slight nausea soon after the first shot, then started having chills and whole body ache from the night (12/18/2020) for 24 hours followed by spontaneous internal hemorrhage (lower GI, significant blood in stool) in the morning  and in the afternoon of 12/20/2020.  The hemorrhage lasted for about 24 hours.  It started slowing down on 12/21/2020, then stopped.    I was evaluated by Dr., (GI) who was not sure if the bleeding was vaccine induced vs. coincidence on 12/23/2021.  Since the bleeding stopped, she cleared me for the 2nd vaccine and advised me for close monitoring for any other episode of bleeding.  I had some fatigue for about 4-5 days since the first shot, then I felt normalized.    Soon after the 2nd vaccine (in about 5-10mins) on 1/8/2021, I started having some discomfort/pain in lower rib region where spleen is.  Initially I felt like some chest pain, but it was more near spleen region, I think... I also had slight intermittent dizziness for about 2 hours after the 2nd injection.  The discomfort in left lower chest/rib improved and resolved in an hour or so.    Then, similar pattern started including chills and whole body ache on the night of 1/8/2021 followed by internal hemorrhage again (significant blood in stool) in the morning and in the afternoon of 1/9/2021.  The bleeding slowed down on 1/10/2021, then stopped.   I reported it to again my GI doctor on 1/11/2021 who ordered CBC to monitor my platelet level.  The result showed down trending from my baseline.    I think the COVID vaccine transiently affected me with internal hemorrhage and lowering platelets/likely potential thrombocytopenia given the clinical symptoms (spontaneous internal hemorrhage).

                                                10 hrs after I received 1st dose of Pfizer I started feeling my heart beating rapidly and hard.  I was short of breath and had nausea and a headache.  This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

I had no issues after that. I received the 2nd shot on  1/15/21, I had the exact same reaction however it only lasted 20 min. I then went to my car and started driving home, about 10 minutes later and while on the freeway I had dizziness, flushing, tachycardia, , shakiness, and facial numbness. I took an exit and was able to pull over in a parking lot. It lasted about 20 minutes. Since that time I have had frequent episodes of dizziness, facial flushing, tremulousness,  facial numbness/tingling, and presyncope. The worst episodes were on 2/1/21 and 2/3/21. I was unable to work because of these symptoms.

                                                The patient was admitted to the hospital on February 10, 2021 for evaluation of jaundice.  This is a healthcare worker (direct patient care) and she received the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in January 13 2021, then subsequently developed some abnormalities of the liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.  Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.  Results of ancillary studies showed that her AST is currently (02/12/21) 196 ALT of 61, her bilirubin total was 7.9 with a direct of 5.5, and on admission her AST was 183 ALT 40, with a total bilirubin of 14.  Her platelet count on admission was 111, currently is 93.  She has some mild microcytic anemia and no leukopenia and in the differential she has increased monocytosis.  Her viral hepatitis serology panel shows hepatitis a IgM that is negative hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with previous vaccination, and hepatitis C antibody negative. COVID-19 antigen was negative on admission 2/10/2021 she reports that she had a Covid PCR done in her office 5 days or so before admission that was also negative. She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.    She reports that before admission, she had normal platelets about 1 or 2 years ago when she was tested, as well as normal liver function test.  She reports that she has had some mild epistaxis as well as bleeding from her lips.  She has some anorexia, she has had some looser stools but has been clear without obvious blood and she has had no hematuria. EGD on 15FEB2021- mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Low risk esophageal varices. Labwork 15FEB2021- AST 173/ALT 64/Alk Phos 235/Plt 109/ Discharged on 02/15/2021 to home with plans for follow-up with GI and PCP.  Prescribed Prednisone with taper off after 28 days. Follow-up appointment has not yet occurred as of the day this report is submitted(2/19/2021).

                                                2 days after the vaccine I developed a rash around the injection site 2/6/2021. After three days the rash was gone without treatment. Then on 2/14/2021 I started feeling burning  pain all over my neck and chest. It was slightly red that night. The next morning my chest, neck, and upper back had a red rash . My chest was the worst of it. Felt like a chemical burn . I went to the Doctor on 2/17/2021 and was told it was a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine. I continued to take Benadryl, Zyrtec  and was given Kenalog. On Sunday 2/21/2021 the pain was so pain and the rash was only getting worse and now on my face so I went to urgent care. There I was given a steroid ( prednisone) , derma smoothe and Pepcid. It has been 10 days and no improvement yet.

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after injection my ears got hit and my face flushed. At about 25 minutes after injection I started to feel my heart race. Medical staff took my pulse and it was extremely high. My blood pressure even on all of my meds was 205/112. My resting pulse topped a little over 140 during monitoring. After about an hour my pulse was 110 and my BP was 190/95 and I went home to rest.  Called my physician a couple days after and alerted him. Monitored BP at home that day and it continued to go back to my normal. By that evening I was back to my baseline.  Other symptoms following day extremely painful arm cold sweats and feeling of unwell all which I know are common side effect. My pulse racing was extremely scary in that I have a hard time raising my pulse when I exercise due to my medication.

                                                Since the beginning of February, 1 week post vaccine, I have had 3 separate instances where I awake in the middle of the night out of a dead sleep with a racing heart and feel like I&#39;m going to vomit or pass out. It usually subsides within 10 minutes.  I have also been having spells of dizziness during the day, usually 3-5 days each week. I have seen my primary care MD, that diagnosed me with vertigo. I have also been to the ER, who then diagnosed me with anxiety and explained my waking up in the middle of the night as a panic attack. I have never had these feelings with physical symptoms prior to my vaccine. I have never had the COVID-19 virus to my knowledge.

                                                Approximately 2.5 hours after injection, a fiery pain started at the injection site, went up to the shoulder, and down the left side of my chest. This was accompanied by chest tightening and slight shortness of breath. The pain ended after about a minute while I was getting my phone to call an ambulance because it was so bad. I chose not to complete the call as the pain began to fade. The chest tightening and breathing issue resolved a couple minutes later. My arm was extremely painful the rest of the day (achy, not the fiery sensation). I have never had a reaction like this to any vaccine or medication.

                                                A couple of minutes of having the vaccine I started having heart palpitations. I didn&#39;t see much of it so I left but it kept on going for the next couple of days then on the following Sunday I ended up going to the urgent care &amp; they sent me to the Emergency room from there. On march 1st I had a miscarriage I was 6 weeks pregnant, There was some questions when I found out I was pregnant to see if I was going to have some issues or not.

A non-pregnant 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 at 39-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks of the suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart murmur, Latex allergy; both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported; and no other medications were received within two weeks of the suspect vaccine. On 19Jan2021, the patient experienced: felt intense heat in her armpit lymph nodes on the right side (non-serious), streaks of heat along the back of her scalp (non-serious), heat in her chest (non-serious), right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder (non-serious), hot flashes (non-serious). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient, ten minutes after the vaccination, felt intense heat in her armpit lymph nodes on the right side. This was followed by streaks of heat along the back of her scalp, and heat in her chest. After about an hour, the right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder. The patient&#39;s &#34;body stayed that way for about 20 hours.&#34; The patient also experienced hot flashes, which was not something that she ever had before. The patient feared getting the second dose because her body felt so off after the first dose. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination with the suspect vaccine.   The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number and Expiration date was unknown), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date, second dose via intramuscularly in right arm on 16Jan2021 15:30; both at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in workplace clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history included depression, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), latex allergy. Concomitant medications included venlafaxine, L-methylfolate; the patient received both the drugs within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took fluoxetine, citalopram and experienced known allergies for both the drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient experienced debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension on 25Jan2021 06:00. On 01Feb2021, the patient underwent lab test and procedure included nasal swab/ COVID-19 by PCR: Negative. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with IV Dexamethazone, Diphenhydramine, ketorolac, promethazine for all the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: On the basis of the available information, the reported events debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension would seem most likely related to intercurrent and/or underlying medical condition and concomitant medication, which is not related to bnt162b2. This case will be reassessed when additional information becomes available. This impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of  the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The worker had me to lay down and took my BP, which was 158/90 and I&#39;m usually 108/60. I remained in that position for about 15 min. My entire body was shaking uncontrollably. My BP came down and they gave me Benadryl before sending me to the ER. Within an hour post Benadryl, I felt drowsy, but back to myself.

                                                At exact time of infection,  whole left arm started getting tingly and warm,  especially from crook of elbow down through fingers. My usual comfortable watch felt tight and annoying.   Was able to walk to observation area,  then started getting dizzy and light- headed.  Still had warm,  tingly feeling in arm that received injection.  My normal resting heart rate is 61 but now it was up to 111 per smart watch (possibly 121 but can&#39;t confirm since I was dizzy and blurry-eyed). In addition to tingly arm,  racing heart,  dizziness,  I felt immediate fatigue and wanted to lay down and sleep. Also,  had dull headache on left-side.  Nurse sat me down and elevated my feet. Also got me some frozen peas for my forehead and neck.  After 12-13 mintues,  I started feeling better.  She kept me under observation for full hour.  Got better and went home.  Heart rate remained elevated at 78-89 rest of evening.  Dull headache remained on left- side only. Similar feeling to when wearing a tight pony tail and you take it out.

                                                Had sore arm for first two days. On the third day started getting palpitations and racing heart. This came and went and woke me up in the middle of the night and early morning several times. Today is day 10 and I was prescribed a 24 hour holter monitor. In the last 3 days I&#39;ve had several episodes of facial nerve pain in my jaw and teeth, numbness in my face and also pins and needles in various parts of my body. Sore and painful spot to the touch under left ribs. Extreme palpitations and heart racing that make me feel like Im going to pass out, sudden pressure on the left side of my neck and ear heartbeat in my left ear during these episodes, trouble breathing , pain and tingling in upper left chest and coughing that goes away in about 30 minutes. Each episode ends with uncontrollable urge to sleep.  Almost feels like an intense food allergy reaction but it happens on a completely empty stomach. They seem to be getting progressively worse

Once i removed my mask  for better breathing, chest became tight and swallowing became extremely difficult. Breathing quickly became challenging. I flagged attendant about my symptoms then quickly rushed to the back patient room. I explained this reaction is similar to an asthma attack - and attempted to use my recuse inhaler.  I used my rescue inhaler about 6-8 times.  I was offered water and to sit down to focus on breathing. Breathing returned to normal after waiting the full 30mins. I immediately scheduled a follow-up with my PCP to discuss my experience.

                                                Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccination dose at 12:37PM. Patient was seated in the vaccination waiting area for her 15 minutes observation window. About 5 minutes after vaccination the patient fainted and fell out of her chair on to the ground. She hit her head on the wall behind her, and ground when falling. Pharmacy staff immediately went to check on patient. She was found to be breathing, but unresponsive for about 20 seconds. 911 was called immediately by another employee. She was positioned lying on the ground with her feet up and came to consciousness quickly. Once awake patient was alert, verbal, and seemed to have a normal mental status. She reported no respiratory issues, no throat or lip symptoms, and no itching or hives. She states that she felt fine other than her head hurting from the fall. She reported no symptoms prior to waking up on the ground. She was speaking in full sentences, responsive, and had a strong, steady pulse at 98 bpm and a normal respiratory rate. No hives, swelling were observed. Patient reported she was a type 1 diabetic and her blood sugar was found to be normal (approx. 145) after she was able to sit. No medications were administered on site as she did not report any additional symptoms indicative of anaphylaxis. The ambulance and local PD arrived quickly. She was walked outside for observation and appeared to be taken away in the ambulance.  The patient was not reached for a follow-up call to check in on her later the same afternoon.

                                                10 minutes after receiving covid vaccine, rapid  heart rate, hard to breathe, and metallic taste in mouth. Advised to go to emergency after been checked out by allergist on site. At emergency, was given Pepcid, steroids, IV fluids, Benadryl intravenously. Also, did bloodwork and chest X-ray. After bloodwork came back, doctor felt okay to release me. Over the week, still felt heavy chested and I could not return to work until a week later. The emergency doctor, sent me home with steroids, Pepcid, and Benadryl to take for the next 3 days. I only took the steroids and Pepcid because the Benadryl made me feel so out of it. I also started to get fatigued couple days after with some body aches. On Saturday morning,  I woke up at 4:00 am to vomit. Had an appointment with my PCP that Monday, told me to take Claritin and Albuetrol inhaler.

                                                The first abnormal effect I experienced was numbness in my inner upper lip. This was intermittent and lasted roughly 24-48 hours after vaccine administration. Then on 3/25, I had muscle cramping/soreness in my lower leg muscles (calves). The next day (3/26), the muscle soreness continued, and my lower leg muscles began to feel tight when walking. On 3/27, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my right 5th digit, which then spread to all my fingers and toes.  That morning, the muscle soreness had also spread into my thighs and bilateral upper extremities. I also noted mild swelling in my hands and feet and could not put my rings on or wear socks or shoes. By that evening, walking became more difficult as the muscle soreness had now turned into muscle weakness. This prompted me to go the ER for evaluation. A CT scan of my head and lab work was done. I was given IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return to the ER the following day for a MRI of my brain. Overnight, the weakness and swelling in my hands and feet progressed . I became unable to walk, go to the bathroom, or feed my self without assistance. The numbness and tingling I first experienced in my inner upper lip returned, and these symptoms were also now noted in the rest of my face as well. I also began having muscle soreness in my neck, my jaw felt sore when chewing food, and I began seeing some floaters. I returned to the ER the morning of 3/28.  They did more blood work, imaging, as well as a lumbar puncture, and I was admitted to hospital. Once admitted, the hospitalist consulted with another hospital and recommended transfer by EMS there where I was admitted under a neurologist&#39;s care. When I arrived at that hospital, I began to feel somewhat better as the soreness and swelling appeared to be improving, and I could walk without assistance. They did a full neurological workup and kept me overnight for observation. Overnight, I did experience a mild headache that was relieved with Tylenol and rest.  I woke up the next morning  (3/29) with nausea and did have a few episodes of vomiting that turned into dry heaving and was given Zofran with relief. The swelling in my hand went down enough that I was able to make a fist and grasp objects with my fingers again. After the neurologist reviewed my labs and work up the morning of 3/29, I was allowed to return home to await final test results as all my tests were looking normal, my symptoms were continuing to improve, and PT had cleared me to be able to return home. Upon discharge, I was instructed  to not get my 2nd COVID vaccination as it was possible that my symptoms were an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccination as no  other diagnosis was found with testing. I was instructed to follow up with my PCP in one week. Since returning home, I have continued to be very easily fatigued and have had some headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I continue to feel weak when walking and have some muscle stiffness when first waking from sleep. I also continue to have some intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling.

A 39 year old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201,Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in right deltoid on 01Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in left deltoid on 01Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing lung cancer from 03Jul2017, metastatic disease from lung cancer from: Dec 2018 and hypertension from: 2007. Concomitant medication included Losartan at 100 mg once a day tablet for blood pressure, Atorvastatin at 80 mg a day tablet for cholesterol, Lorbrena from 26Jun2019 at 100 mg once a day tablet for lung cancer, vitamin D3 at 3000 IU once a day gel cap and coq10 supplement at 100mg and all the drugs were ongoing. The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021. As a treatment therapy the patient received some CBD and went to sleep, and this lasted about 2 days and after that it got a little better. The patient was improved but had slight lasting effects. The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

On the morning of April 10th I awoke to feeling severely winded as if I had run 18 marathons just to walk up 3 steps or to walk across a room.  I was taken to the ER where they performed a catscan on me and could see that my lungs were ?full? of blood clots and I was experiencing a pulmonary embolism.  I do not smoke, take birth control pills, I do not drink.  There is no family history of clotting, nor did any traumatic incident happen within the last two weeks to cause this.

                                                I immediately felt dizzy, like I was drunk. At around 4pm, I started feeling wheezy. It felt like there was a mastiff sitting on my chest. I took some benadryl, which helped. The next day, the feeling persisted and I had a mild cough, especially while lying down. More benadryl. Same on the third day. I did not seek medical attention because I didn&#39;t think it was an extraordinary reaction and I have had much worse reactions to other things in the past that have been managed with benadryl. I thought what I was experiencing was an expected side effect based on the information I had been given. The feeling started to ease by the 4th day, but then the insomnia, mood swings, exhaustion and body aches set in. The cough was sporadic, but still present. Today, I still get the heavy chest feeling intermittently, activity doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect or cause. My arm still itches at the injection site and hurts when touched.  I went back to get my second dose on 4/9. When the nurse asked me if I had had any adverse reactions to the first one, I told her about the chest heaviness and coughing and the other symptoms. She stopped what she was doing and called her medical director. They both decided that the first response was enough of an anaphylactic reaction to be a caution for the second. They refused to give me the second dose because they thought the second would elicit a much worse reaction - possibly to the point of intubation. They told me that I would have to be evaluated by a physician and that I would need a &#34;doctor&#39;s note&#34; in order to get the second vaccine.

Worsening POTS/Dysautonomia Sx with severe flushing episodes that left me unable to work as a physician for 6wks. The episodes got progressively worse. I eventually ended up on steroids which did improve my symptoms. I was diagnosed officially with POTS and small fiber neuropathy. I attempted to go back to work but became too fatigued and weak to be able to walk, my husband had to come get me and I was taken to his care in a wheelchair. I could not get out of bed for 5 days. I saw rheumatology and am back on steroids. I am now showing lab evidence of lupus. I have polyarthritis and polymyalgia on exam as well as muscle weakness in the quads. I continue to have neuropathy.

After the second shot these episodes starred happening frequently along with diarrhea, neuropathy of the tongue, legs, hands etc. Her face started flushing and burning all the time. She became so ill she couldn&#39;t work for 6 weeks. The patient was diagnosed with Dysautonomia/POTS (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), lymphocytic colitis, and small fiber neuropathy. The patient took 17 days of steroids for possible allergic reaction or mast cell activation syndrome. She spoke with Dr who believed she had an autoimmune reaction to the vaccine causing inflammatory Dysautonomia and was enrolled in their trial. She had to take more time off work because now she had profound fatigue and proximal muscle weakness. The patient was testing positive for ANA (Antinuclear antibody) and dsDNA (Double stranded DNA antibody) but her rheumatologist did not think she had lupus. He and her neurologist felt that had have a vaccine induced autoimmune inflammatory disorder and that IVIG was the best treatment. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included ANA: positive on unknown date, dsDNA: positive on unknown date, PCR Nasal Swab: negative   on 26Mar2021, Tuberculin skin tests: unknown results on unknown date.  The patient received Prednisone as treatment for the adverse events. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care and Disability or permanent damage.
