                                                Patient in clinic for chief complaint of possible side effect of the covid vaccine which she received yesterday.  She states that she woke up at 0200 with chest tightness, achyness and headache.  She rates the discomfort 7/10 last night and improved now to 5/10.  She denies any worsening with any type of exertion and states that she can do simple things like take a shower, walk across the room, down the street or even stairs without any worsening.  She denies any SOB or chest pain--just feels tight.  Doesn&#39;t feel like she can&#39;t get a full breath or get the air out of her lungs either.  She received her first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday (4:23pm) and had no difficulty with the injection itself and then 9.5 hours later woke up from sleep with this chest tightness as well as achyness and headache.    She states that she had the exact same symptoms when she had positive covid test back in August of this year with the addition of fatigue which lasted for 5 days.  At that time it was not felt necessary to do any further testing nor treat with steroids according to cardiology.  She does have history of LV non-compaction cardiomyopathy and her last visit with cardiology was about 2 years ago and she had a normal EKG and echo only showed &#34;mild LV non compaction at the apex&#34; at that time. He did not need to see her again until she is 18 unless she has problems.  She states that she generally does very well and other than this tightness she does not have any other significant symptoms.

My daughter dealt with the other symptoms but her asthma became less treatable over the two days since the second shot. I finally administered the nebulizer and inhaled steroid today after all other treatments failed to relieve her symptoms. She is doing better but I will follow up with the pediatrician.

                                                Patient presented for her first COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately a minute after vaccine was given, she was noted to be seated upright in the passenger seat of her car, with head bent forward and eyes open. She was unresponsive, stiff posture, and was placed into a reclined position. She then had some posturing with head turned to the left, no eye deviation or nystagmus, no tonic-clonic movement. Radial pulse was thready, bradycardia was noted, with normal respirations. She was noted to become diaphoretic and pale/ashen color noted to the face and arms. She became responsive within a few minutes, however initially was not able to answer questions clearly. She had no loss of bowel or bladder function. EMS assisted with evaluation.  Initial blood pressure 78/31, HR 54, SpO2 100%.  EMS then transferred her to the stretcher and she was transitioned from her car to the ambulance. She continued to improve spontaneously with BP 94/61 then 103/60 and HR 86 then 74. SpO2 remained stable at 100%.  Skin color improved. She had normal responses to questions, no complaints of headache, dizziness, chest tightness, shortness of breath, numbness or tingling. She had some shaking/voluntary movement of the limbs and body noted, but she could control and stop this voluntarily, no myoclonic or tonic-clonic jerking noted.  After syncopal event occurred, mom reported that the patient has a history of syncope routinely with blood draws and vaccines in the past, however this episode was slightly more prolonged and seizure-like activity was different. She has had some jerking movement previously with syncope which lasts 20-30 seconds, different from today&#39;s response. No known history of seizure disorder.

                                                Asthma Attack started at 1 pm while seated and attending virtual class. She was under no distress and was not in any way exerting herself. She described the attack as a feeling of someone sitting on her chest and began to hyperventilate. The color drained from her face and her hands felt numb. Her asthma attacks are generally exercise-induced, so this was highly unusual.  She took a dose of albuterol ( 2 puffs with a spacer) and followed her asthma action plan. She laid down and slowed her breathing. 20 minutes later her facial color returned to normal. Two hours later her hands returned to normal. She was disoriented for about 5 hours.

The patient&#39;s mother initially supported the patient and I was called to assist the patient to the floor. The patient was very pale in appearance as she was assisted gently to the floor, avoiding any injury.  EMS was called shortly after the event around 1810. The patient remained conscious however was a bit disoriented initially while lying on the floor.  The patient recovered quickly, however remained nauseous and complained of feeling hot. Upon questioning the patient, she had not eaten since lunch at school at 1300. The patient was given a cold water and a sprite, of which she had a couple of drinks out of each. The patient was relocated back into a chair at 1815 as she was feeling much better. EMS arrived at 1821. EMS performed a general assessment and a blood pressure check resulting in 130/80. The patient&#39;s mother dismissed any further treatment from EMS.  EMS exited the building at 1827.  The patient and mother waited in the store for a while longer.  Both patient and mother exited on their own, denying escort from associates at 1840.

                                                Patient stated in evaluation form that she had passed out once before after giving blood for labwork. She and her mother decided to continue with the vaccination as it had never occurred before after getting a vaccine.  A few minutes after the vaccine the patient lost consciousness.  Mom stated that her face tensed up right before hand.  The patient remained in her chair for the duration of the event.  She regained consciousness about 30 to 60 seconds later, and within a few minutes she was conscious but still very shaky, pale, and hot.  She was able to sip some water and we put a cool, wet  paper towel on the back of her neck.  The patient and her mother remained seated and under observation for an additional 15 to 20 minutes with no further issues, at which point they left the store.  I followed up with the patients mother the next day and she said her daughter was exhausted last night, but this morning she woke up feeling well and went to school like normal.

Patient placed on ECMO and imaging revealed bilateral large pulmonary embolism as likely etiology of arrest. Risk factors included oral contraceptive use.  Labs have since confirmed absence of Factor V leiden or prothrombin gene mutation. Patient declared dead by neurologic criteria 3/30/21.

She was completely unresponsive and given 1 dose of epi and she responded to the epi.  Her dad was with her and said that she has anxiety issues and this is probably the reason she passed out.  EMS was called  and it was decided between EMS and Dad that there was no reason to transport her to the hopital as she was doing fine after being checked out by EMS;  Dad signed a waiver with EMS declining transport to the hospital.

In the meantime, we had call 911 and when they evaluated her, they felt it was somewhat of a panic attack since she did have anxiety before getting the vaccine.

She did not hit her head because I was able to help her on her way down - it was a ver small room with 3 people in it. The pharmacist was there and he said it was a seizure, she just jerked her chin up, sharply 3 or 4 times. She laid on the ground for about five minutes, then sat on the ground, then sat in a chair for a total of about 20 minutes. She felt dizzy and nauseated for about 15 minutes after. She drank a juice and felt better so we drove home, no other symptoms since.

                                                After RN administered vaccine she spoke to my daughter for some time afterwards 5-6 minutes and my daughter was fine answering her questions and just visiting with her. She directed us to the table to schedule her second vaccine which was directly in front of us. We went to this table and spoke with two other ladies choosing a date and time and she was also fine talking with them and answering questions of eat time offered and then suddenly she went straight back with warning passed completely out and struck the back of her head on the concrete floor. EMS and RN?s who were there went to her aid immediately and she was unconscious for a little over a minute. They initially couldn?t get her to respond and finally she came to and had no idea what happened and no recollection of falling. She had blurred vision and bleeding a bit from the back of her head and they wanted her to have CT of her head after hitting it that hard. They took her by ambulance to hospital and they assessed her and ordered a CT. The CT thankfully came back clear and she has follow up appointment with concussion doctor first thing in the morning. On discharge she was describing her pain from hitting head a 7/10 It was very scary and everyone around us was visibly upset as well. She has never fainted or had a reaction to any other shot, vaccine or needle before today so that was a very unusual reaction.

                                                After getting the 2nd dose of Pfizer, two days later, my daughter developed chest pain. She gets the chest pain every day and it today&#39;s date is 4/27/2021. She went to urgent care on April 18, 2021. However, she kept having chest pain and Saturday, April 24th the chest pain was intense. Patient states she has daily chest pain. Chest pain tends to be intermittent but she has it several times throughout the day. Sometimes the chest pain can be intense. (patient has a history of Kawasaki Disease, she received IVIG as a toddler and was on aspirin for a few weeks after the treatment. We were concerned if the chest pain was related to her heart).  Currently, still monitoring her chest pains daily.

                                                Stroke; severe allergic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient&#39;s father) from the Pfizer-sponsored program. A 16-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the Right Arm (also reported as: right shoulder) on 23Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) at 16-years-old as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included heart valve operation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Mechanical heart valves).  Concomitant medications included an unspecified medication, taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, which was reported as: &#34;Yes she is taking other medication.&#34; On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced stroke and severe allergic reaction (medically significant). The clinical course was reported as follows: On behalf of his 16-year-old daughter, the patient&#39;s father reported that she had the first dose administer in the right shoulder on 23Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, the patient had a stroke.  The patient&#39;s father stated, &#34;our lives have changed, completely.&#34; The patient&#39;s father reported that his daughter was receiving medical care ever since then; and was also being treated by a physician.  The patient&#39;s father was asking about compensation from Pfizer regarding his daughter&#39;s severe adverse event (AE) that occurred after the first dose of vaccine. The patient&#39;s father reported that the case had been submitted by the (Name) healthcare team &#34;to the FDA and to Pfizer, and I haven&#39;t heard back from either.&#34; The patient&#39;s father mentioned in passing, that he &#34;could call (Name) and have this all over the news&#34; but that he &#34;wants to be responsible&#34; and doesn&#39;t want to do that.  The patient&#39;s father stated the concern, &#34;Well my concern I am not sure that medical profession is what I really need to do, my concern is that my daughter took the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 23Mar2021 in (Name) in vaccination location. On 29Mar2021, 6 days later, she had a stroke, and that she is receiving a medical care ever since then , now  my question is like I said probably for  maybe for correlated relation type of person define as well as  for it  there is a compensation for adverse reaction to COVID vaccination being that this was only thing that was introduce in her system as far as doing that time the vaccination shot.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: &#34;that&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34; on an unknown date; also reported: &#34;Yes that&#39;s been ongoing as far as giving blood. That&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34;. Therapeutic measures were not taken and was reported as &#34;no she isn&#39;t taking anything for it.&#34; The clinical outcome of the events, stroke and severe allergic reaction, was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021411875 Pfizer

Symptoms started pretty much right after getting the shot but the dizziness and tightness in chest stopped after I took a nap about an hour after the shot. As of the submission of the form I am still feeling soreness in my arm but it?s lessened a bit and I still feel nauseous and am having trouble breathing properly.

She was given one dose of oral steroids by PCP, but continued to have the feeling that she couldn&#39;t breathe due to her throat closing throughout the day so she presented to the ED. There, she reported continued chest pain, worsening SOB, and the feeling that she could not breathe. She was tachycardic to 140 bpm, but otherwise vitals were stable. She was admitted and monitored on continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry overnight. By the following day on 4/29, her symptoms had largely resolved and she was discharged.

                                                16 yo female came into our injection site today 05/05/21 to receive her first pfizer vaccine. She was accompanied by her father. Pt received vaccine IM to her left deltoid. Pt completed vaccine at 2:55pm at which she sat down for her 15 minute observation period. As soon as she sat down she called over the staff that administered the vaccine. She explained to her that she felt nausea and was breathing heavily. I then walked over to them and the attendee was very pale and breathing heavily. By that time I had RN getting attendees history from her father, She has no history of allergic reactions, not taking any medications and no current illness. She is &#34;slightly asthmatic&#34; but is not taking any rx.  RN was helping me by putting cold pack behind attendees neck. Pt then proceeded to explain that she felt nauseas and starting dry heaving. RN then brought over trash can and attendee started to vomit. I then started to proceed and take her vitals. first set of vitals were taken at 2:58pm BP: 90/60 HR: 132 RR: 24 O2: 100%. Attendee at this point was diaphoretic, pale, breathing heavily and vomiting. We continued to monitor attendee in which she started to feel better by 3:08 pm. She was no longer pale, diaphoretic or vomitting and was breathing normally. We provided attendee with water and continued to monitor her. Now that pt was calm, I was able to ask her some questions. She stated that she had a smoothie and an avocado toast about an hour prior to vaccine. She explained to me that she does have a phobia to needles and was feeling very anxious prior to appointment. I then repeated her vitals at 3:16pm BP: 98/60 HR:89 RR: 20 O2: 99%.  I had attendee stand up off chair and walk at 3:22pm. She felt fine and did not feel dizzy at all. No signs of distress noted. She was then discharged and walked out with her dad at 3:25pm.

As she was walking to the teacher&#39;s desk, she lost consciousness and fainted, hitting her head on a desk, scraping her neck on a desk, and suffering several other minor injuries from the fall.  She was immediately seen by school nurse and released to my care for the rest of the day. She rested at home and then was seen in at Walk-In Clinic to be evaluated for a concussion.  On Day 2 after receiving the vaccine, the patient reported a sore throat, but no other symptoms.  She was seen on the third day post-vaccine by our pediatrician&#39;s office for possible strep.  She tested negative for strep and a concussion from her fainting episode was confirmed due to the lingering headache.

                                                My 16-year-old daughter, very healthy without any health conditions, got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday evening, April 10th, at around 5pm. On Wednesday, she started complaining of shortness of breath, chest pains, which she described as a feeling of someone stubbing her heart. By Thursday, she began blacking out repeatedly throughout the day, each blackout lasting about a minute. These progressed and whenever she blacked out, she would not remember what happened. At first, she and I brushed it off as maybe lack of calcium since she rarely drinks milk. But as they intensified, I began to become more concerned. I told her I cannot leave her by herself in the house as I prepared to go pick up her young siblings from school then schedule an appointment with her doctor. On our way back home, she blacked out again, however, it was for more than a minute. Straight away, I drove to the  ER close by. The doctor came back to inform me that her heartbeat was irregular and concerning based on her age. In that same moment, she began complaining of excessive pain like someone punching her heart out, and then she passed out again. Still with my two other children, the whole ordeal began to frighten them and illicit some heavy tears.  Being that this ER was general admission, the doctors insisted they call in the paramedics to transport her to another ER for children. However, after being transported to the other ER, her condition began to intensify rather quickly and the pediatric doctor at the second ER informed us we would have to be transferred to Childrens intensive care unit where the cardiologists could check her heart, find the ultimate cause, and monitor her closely. In that moment, as a mother, I was speechless and extremely terrified. Seeing my daughter being transferred from ER to ER, made it even tougher on me so much that I could no longer hold myself together. Here she was in terrible pain and being moved around with no clear diagnosis and treatment.  From there on, we spent a couple days in the Cardiac ICU waiting and praying with friends for answers and the best treatment she could get to ease the pain. By about the third day of being in the ICU, the cardiologists informed me, she had Acute Myocarditis. This was so shocking in a sense that both sides of the family have no history of heart issues. Secondly, she is a very healthy child.

We called 911.  Her lips started turning blue.  I administered 0.3mg epinephrine auto injector and the color in her lips came back.   Paramedics arrived evaluated her and transported her to the hospital.

The COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech 0.3mL administered IM in right deltoid while patient was sitting. Patient remained sitting for 10 minutes after administered dose. Patient reported feeling well after the injection. Patient stood up while we continued to talk, after 2 more minutes passed out while standing. Suddenly, patient begain to go limp and her eyes crossed and rolled back. Patient fell backwards into the privacy curtain and into aisle 13 of the store. Patient&#39;s head bounced off the floor. Immunizer  knelt next to patient. Patient was unresponsive until immunizer placed cold hand on back of neck and front of chest to check if she was breathing, immunizer calmly  guided patient to breath, slow deep breaths into the belly and patient&#39;s eyes fluttered open. She said her head hurt really bad. Immunizer offered to the accompanying adult to call EMS because patient should be evaluated after hitting her head so hard. The accompanying adult denyed EMS, then stating that patient had previously fainted while walking and said that she would be fine.

                                                The patient felt tired and describes her eyes going dark, then passed out a few minutes after vaccination.  She was vaccinated and then left the immunization room to sit down for a 15 minute waiting period.  When she went to sit down, she collapsed on the floor.  Her mother assisted her into a chair.  She continued to be incoherent and have her eyes rolling back into her head for a few minutes.  We used a cool cloth on her forehead and the back of her neck.  The parents requested that we call 911.  EMS arrived shortly and evaluated her.  Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse ox, blood sugar and chest sounds were all within normal range.  The patient stated that her arm felt heavy and &#34;funny&#34;.  She then stated that her tongue felt funny.  EMS evaluated her tongue and said it looked normal.  To err on the side of caution, she was taken to the hospital to determine whether or not she was having a delayed onset anaphylactic reaction.  This patient has no history of seizures.

Her course was complicated by respiratory failure (requiring ICU admission for CPAP), pancytopenia, diarrhea with buttock skin breakdown requiring rectal tube for wound and stool management, and extensive workup which was unrevealing for an infectious cause.  She clinically improved with respect to pancytopenia with discontinuation of felbamate, and completed a treatment course with Zosyn for suspected buttock SSTI.

She remained seated in the room and closed her eyes a couple times but never appeared to lose consciousness.  Her dad joined us in the room and confirmed she was really nervous before the vaccine.  We kept her seated for several minutes and then she said she felt sick and vomited.  After that she started to regain her color and was able to move to the waiting room.  She sat there for about 5 more minutes and then felt well enough to leave with her dad.

A 16-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 25Apr2021 (Lot Number: EWO171) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, Pyle disease, food allergies, short stature, seasonal allergies, peanuts allergies and nuts allergies. It was unknown if the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. On 26Apr2021, the patient had elevated temperatures to 104 [unspecified unit], 4-5 days post vaccination (pending clarification) with associated chills and headaches. Thrombocytopenia noted. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was provided for the adverse events. The patient was tested post vaccination with a nasal swab test on 28Apr2021 and the result of negative. The reporter did not consider the events was serious. The outcome of the event was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event thrombocytopenia was observed only 1 day after vaccination.  It is unlikely that thrombocytopenia is related to BNT162B2.  It&#39;s more likely intercurrent medical condition. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Mother and I moved patient to a laying down position where she immediately woke up and knew where she was and what just happened. Declined any other symptoms. Mom said she passes out often after vaccinations. Patient was conscious carrying on a conversation like normal immediately after coming to. Over the next 30 minutes I tried to get patient to a sitting position to take her blood pressure but every time we tried she needed to lay back down because she felt like she was going to pass out. After trying this twice and being unsuccessful I had EMS called to check on patient to make sure nothing more serious going on. EMS came and took a couple blood pressures and pulses which were normal. Patient was starting to feel better. Walked out with EMS and planned on going home.

A 16-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0167, expiry date: Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left deltoid, on 30Apr2021 15:30, as 1st dose, single, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a pharmacy/drug store. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On 30Apr2021 15:30, the patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and was very anxious. She wanted her mom to be present. On the same day, 30Apr2021 15:35, five minutes later, the patient was shaking, and she fainted. The reporter did not know if she was having a convulsion or a seizure. A few minutes later, the patient was sitting and becoming more alert. The patient was given water and one dose of Benadryl. The patient&#39;s vital signs were checked (unknown result). The reporter talked to the patient&#39;s mother and contacted the patient&#39;s pediatrician. The events resulted to emergency room and physician&#39;s office visits. Later in the evening, the reporter followed up with the mother and she confirmed that the patient was doing well and better. The mother asked the reporter if the patient should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of the events fainted, shaking,  &#34;didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure&#34; and &#34;was very anxious&#34; was recovering. The reporter assessed the events fainted, shaking,  &#34;didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure&#34; as serious (medically significant). The reporter considered that BNT162B2 has a causal effect to the adverse events.  Follow-up (18May2021: New information received from a contactable pharmacist includes: reporter information, lab data, suspect drug details (vaccination site and vaccination time), event details (onset time provided, outcome updated to recovering, causality and seriousness assessment provided).  Follow up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, and on a reportedly closed temporal association, the company assessed that a reasonable possibility could not be excluded that the reported events (fainted;  didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure) were related to the suspect product BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He is warm and well-perfused although is slightly tachycardic but appears anxious.  His reported inability to move her arms and legs does not seem consistent with a neurologic etiology of this complaint and more likely consistent with anxiety/conversion reaction in the setting of a vasovagal episode.  Will give zyrtec at mother and patient&#39;s request, PO challenge and reassess.

Mom noticed that patient&#39;s arms went rigid right before she passed out. Patient was still breathing and was laid on the ground to her side and 911 was called immediately. Mom was massaging her thighs and arms to increase blood flow and she regained consciousness within a few minutes. She was very pale and felt weak. She was given water and remained laying on the ground for another 10 minutes before EMS arrived. She explained she gets anxiety about any medical procedure, has had history of fainting after shots/blood draw/blood pressure reading. EMS took fingerstick reading and gave her oxygen to ensure she doesn&#39;t faint again from blood glucose fingerstick. Vitals came out to be normal. Mom explained this is very normal and she doesn&#39;t see the need to take her to the hospital. EMS offered to have patient with them in the ambulance for another 15-20 minutes before she&#39;s free to leave.

Both her BP and blood sugar were within normal range, while her heart rate was out of range. The paramedics suggested to the parents that their daughter needs further monitoring. The parents agreed and left wit the Paramedics.

It was initially mild so we did a watch and wait overnight but when it did not go away by morning of 4/18/21 we went to Urgent Care  .  Upon presentation at urgent care, she had an irregular EKG, we were advised to immediately do to a Hospital ER , upon arrival she presented with same EKG findings from urgent care, BW was run and her troponin level was a 7, this hospital recommended (after consultation with their cardiologist) that based on her age and urgency of the heart condition, we should be transported to a pediatric hospital with cardiology expertise.  She was transported by ambulance to another Hospital, Cardiology Unit. .  After a scary 24 hour overnight stay at the hospital she was released on 4/19/21.

I threw up 5 times and my arms started to get numb. I had a fever when I got home and I couldn?t move because my body hurt so badly. Migraine and dizziness has been persistent ever since and is interfering with my daily life. Been treating with tylenol which helps a little but not completely. As soon as I stand up and move I feel like I?m going to pass out.

                                                about 5 minutes after administration, patient became unresponsive and was going in and out of consciousness. Her pupils became dilated and she would not respond to stimuli. Her respiratory status was unclear. No hives or rash could be observed. Patient became pale in the face. An allergic reaction could not be ruled out and the patient became less responsive so an EpiPen 0.3mg was administered in the left thigh. Patient was placed on her back on the ground. She became more alert and seemed to have normal breathing. EMS arrived and took vitals. Blood pressure was 138/77 with a heart rate of 88 bpm. Patient&#39;s father is taking her to her PCP for follow up this afternoon.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

                                                Recipient is a 17yo who presented for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. She reported some anxiety related to receiving dose #2, and had some nausea after dose #1. She was alone as a driver of her own POV.  Consent was obtained from the recipient and her custodial grandparent by phone, witnessed by doctor. She initially did well after the vaccine, but after approximately 5 minutes began to complain of feeling nauseated, lightheaded, and tingling extremities (hands and feet). She was noted to be hyperventilating, and was placed in a supine position but continued to feel some lightheadedness and difficulty breathing. Breath sounds were clear without wheezing noted, HR 70s with RRR. She was noted to have ongoing anxiety, nausea and symptoms progressed and although she remained normotensive to hypertensive (initial BP 128/74), she had repeated episodes of syncope.  She was transferred to the ambulance and further vitals and EKG were obtained. She had some confusion after episodes of syncope and some seizure-like activity with syncope, with very brief episodes of LOC, with noted tachycardia with HR up to the 140s during episodes of syncope.  BP ranged 129/86 to 140/84. IV access obtained and she was given NS and started on oxygen at 2 liters, but saturations remained in the 98-99% range. She was ultimately transferred to the local ER for further evaluation and management given ongoing symptoms, evaluated at hospital.

A 17-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Apr2021 (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, panic attacks, migraines and acne. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. It was unknown if there were other vaccines in four weeks. The patient did not have Covid prior to vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. Concomitant medications in two weeks included ondansetron hydrochloride (ZOFRAN) taken for anti-nausea, start and stop date were not reported; doxycycline taken for acne, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took glycerol (GLYCERIN) and experienced allergies. The patient got her vaccine on 12Apr2021. Two nights after her vaccine (14Apr2021), she got shaky and feeling bad and burning sensation in her body. No fever at that time, but slight elevated temp (99.7F max) the day after the vaccine (13Apr2021). Mother gave her anti-nausea medication (ondansetron hydrochloride 2 mg) and within 5 minutes her jaw got paralyzed. She couldn&#39;t talk. It lasted about 30 min. Mother called ambulance and patient was brought to ER. ER didn&#39;t do bloodwork or any evaluation. ER didn&#39;t know what happened per mother. She has been off balance this week since getting her vaccine (Apr2021). She feels better this morning but she still feels off balance. Not sleeping well at night due to pressure feeling in her chest up and she shivers to get the feeling away per patient (unspecified date). Slept better last night as of 17Apr2021. No facial drooping. She can smile and lift her eyebrows. Patient had &#34;brain fog&#34; this week as well after the vaccine.

There was no treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome was recovered on an unspecified date for the events &#34;jaw got paralyzed&#34; and &#34;she couldn&#39;t talk&#34;; recovering for the event &#34;not sleeping well at night&#34;; not recovered for the event &#34;off balance&#34;; and unknown for the rest of the events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based from temporal relation of event and vaccine administration, Trismus as an event in relation to suspected drug BNT162B2 cannot be totally excluded.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of receiving the shot, my daughter felt hotness running down the length of her vaccinated arm and into her hand. Started feeling hot and started to produce a small patch of hives on the outside of the throat and chest. Did vigorous windmill motions with vaccinated arm.  She had a feeling of slight unwellness that was followed by a rush of energy.  As we leave the store and start to drive home her hives are a little bit worse and she says she feels a little lightheaded and has some heart palpations. But is still reporting a rush of energy. By the time we get home 10 minutes later hives,  lightheadedness, and heart palpations have resolved.  She feels great the rest of the day. Next day slight redness around the injection site and arm a bit sore. The following day redness is gone but a slight rash is starting to show up around the neck. 5 days later, the rash becomes inflamed, sore, hot and itchy, hives are full upper-body flareups. She takes Allegra 24 for hives control. Rash comes and goes daily.  Acts more like hives. Allegra 24 controls hives mostly along with icing. After a few days, the effectiveness of the Allegra 24 is not as efficient with the neck rash. Switches to Zyrtec 24 which seems to provide better relief from both hives and rash around the neck. Sees Dr. April 29th. He advises not to take a second dose of Pfizer at this time and prescribes her an EpiPen.

Mom states she looked over, patient&#39;s eyes were rolled back, she was shaking, and not responding to mom. Patient does not remember this part. She states the next thing she remembers is looking up at nurses looking down on her. Mom thinks she was out for a few minutes. Of note, patient had not had anything to eat or drink on day of vaccination. She also has a history of syncopal episode after a toradol injection, and with illness.

Client appeared &#34;unsteady on her feet&#34;. EMT rushed to patient and guided her slowly to the ground while protecting her head. Patient then fainted. EMTs assisted patient to gravity bed where patient regained consciousness. Patient was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and event (AAO x 4) immediately following the incident. Client&#39;s vitals were assessed every 5 minutes. They were recorded as follows 10:19- Blood Pressure (BP) 100/74, Heart Rate (HR) 86, Oxygen Saturation (SPO2) 99%, and Respiratory Rate (RR) 18; 10:24- BP 100/72, HR 81, SPO2 99% RR 18; 10:29- BP 100/76, HR 82, SPO2 99% RR 16; 10:34- BP 102/74, HR 84, SPO2 99% RR 18; 10:39- BP 100/72, HR 82, SPO2 99% RR 18; 10:44- BP 110/76, HR 86, SPO2 99% RR 18. Client was given a bottle of water and instructed to remain in a semi-fowler&#39;s (45 degree) position until vitals stabilized. Patient remained on vaccination site for 30 minutes following the episode of fainting. EMT obtained orthostatic vital signs (vital trend from lying down, to sitting, to standing). Patient was negative for orthostatic hypotension. Symptoms resolved as indicated above in vital signs. Patient stated she was &#34;feeling better&#34; and declined EMS transport. Patient and father were educated by RN on home care (rest and fluids) and to seek emergency medical attention if symptoms persisted or worsened. Patient left the vaccination site at 10:45 with father and sister with steady gait and in no change in status.

Client drank some water, declined snack. Clients hand began to shake, RN offered to lay client on a cot but client declined. Her dad came to check on her, she broke down saying that her arms were numb and chest was tight. The 15 vaccine minute timer went off, client stood but legs were week. She sat down and then slid herself onto the floor. She at first went into a fetal position then laid out flat on the floor. Client began acting more panicked and frantic with short quick breaths and her hands appeared to be contracting some. Clinic team made the decision to call 911 and administer 0.50 mg epinephrine. Ambulance arrived quickly and client was taken to the Medical Center via ambulance.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 10:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to Red dye, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heart murmur, Wilkies syndrome. The patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not take other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took Excedrin and experienced allergies. The patient previously received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Feb2021 09:45 AM (Lot Number: EL9269) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. On 24Feb2021 at around 7:00pm she started getting a migraine at the base of her head. She then was lethargic, and became extremely nauseous. She started getting extremely cold and then hot within a matter of minutes (inability to control temperature regulation). Her heart rate rose to around 133 just laying down. Her ribs and lungs hurt. And her stomach began to have a really intense stabbing pains. At one point it felt as if she could feel every cell in her body if that makes sense. Not the worst pain she had experienced but definitely not pleasant. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being run over by a car and 1 being a paper cut) she would say it was a 5-6. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Facility type vaccine was facility. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and did not have COVID test post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

Patient could breathe more deeply after the epi pen administered.  One pharmacist stayed with her in case another dose of epinephrine needed to be administered, once the paramedics arrived the pharmacist left the room so they could care for the patient.

                                                The Pfizer shot was given at 1:30. We shopped at the store for 15 minutes (they didn&#39;t have a waiting area to sit down). We left the store. As I (her mother) was driving home she passed out and her head almost hit the dashboard. I grabbed her head and pulled into a parking spot. She was white as a ghost. I called 911. The ambulance arrived 6-8 minutes later. She was speaking incoherently to the paramedics and her blood pressure was extremely low. They transported her to the Medical Center. Her blood pressure was monitored and she was given a bag of fluids. We were there over 2 hours before she was released. They said it was Vasovagal Syncope and the paramedic said he had a few similar calls shortly after the Covid-19 shot had been administered (I hope they are all reporting it).  A friend of ours called us and told us his daughter passed out after the Pfizer shot just last week. She was at  (college in out of state) and got her shot there. They didn&#39;t report it or anything. I think this needs to be looked into. Especially in regards to younger people.

                                                bleeding; less soreness at the injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 18-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration administrated on left arm on 05Apr2021 at 16:00 at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other medications in two weeks. The patient did not have any known allergies. She received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, Lot number: EN6204, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administrated on left arm on 14Mar2021 at 15:00 (03:00 PM) at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 05Apr2021 04:00 PM, reported that the 2nd dose of vaccine caused unusual amount of bleeding after needle was removed. The patient had to clean excess blood after the shot. The band aid was soaked with blood. The patient experienced less soreness at the injection site compared to the first vaccine shot. The concern is whether the vaccine was bled out due improper injection. She did not have any other vaccine in four weeks before the covid-19 vaccine dose. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. She was not having COVID prior to the vaccination, neither was tested for Covid-19 post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date in 2021.

Offered patient water and allowed to remove face mask. Instructed on breathing slowly in through the nose and out through the mouth. This helped briefly but then patient verbalized that she was feeling more light headed and thought she should lie down on exam table. Remained at patient&#39;s side but did not allow her to stand up in order to relocate from chair to exam table. Approximately 7 minutes after vaccine administration, patient briefly lost consciousness for less than 30 seconds and had slight jerking movements during this time. Remained at patient&#39;s side and prevented her from falling out of chair, hitting head, or other injury during syncopal event. After patient regained consciousness, she began sipping on water. A cold, wet paper towel was placed to the back of her neck. Continued to observe patient in exam room for another 5 minutes then she was escorted to waiting area by provider. Waiting area was just outside exam room and patient remained in the presence of a patient care technician, as well as her mother. Patient remained in waiting area for a total observation time of 30 minutes. No other adverse events occurred. Patient and mother both reported that patient does not do well after vaccines and has had similar symptoms after other vaccines in the past.

After noticing the patient slumped over we made sure the patient was still breathing.  We got the emergency equipment and contacted the emergency protocol, and the patient woke back up promptly and communicated that they felt dizzy.  We allowed the patient to lay down and waited for the emergency services.  She felt better as time passed and by the time her dad made, they refused to go to the hospital and made it home on their own accord

An 18-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EW0170), intramuscular, administered in the right arm on 20Apr2021 at 12:45 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient had not been tested for COVID post vaccination. On 20Apr2021 at 12:45, the patient and her father moved into the waiting area with vehicle. According to the patient&#39;s dad, the patient began seizing in the car one minute after the vaccine administration. The dad called out to waiting area monitor. At 12:57 the patient was visibly having tonic clonic seizure and was administered with EpiPen in the right Leg. 911 was called. The patient stopped seizing and was awake and confused. She then became AOx4 (oriented to four spheres; time/place/person/situation). The patient visibly distressed and hyperventilating. At 12:59 the patient had tonic clonic movements and seizure again. The seizure lasted less than 15 seconds. The patient then became AOx4 again, distressed, and became nauseous. Heart rate (HR) was 56 and SpO2 was 98%.  At 13:00 the patient vomited while sitting up. The patient was still distressed and hyperventilating with respiratory rate (RR) of 30. The patient&#39;s post vomiting HR was 116 and SpO2 was 97%. The patient moved to a stretcher and moved to the shade. At 13:06 firefighters arrived and the patient had an HR of 114, BP of 141/46, SpO2 of 97%, RR 24 and AOx4. At 13:12 the ambulance arrived and the patient was taken to (Place). The events resulted in a visit to the Emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, and on close temporal association, a reasonable possibility cannot be excluded that the suspect drug BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine)  contributed to the occurrence of the serious event Generalised tonic-clonic seizure.

                                                Patient was near syncope. After receiving the vaccine about 2 minutes she started getting light headed. Patient was given water and animal crackers to get. She was feeling a little better but when she turned her head she still felt lightheaded. I had her eat and drink some more water. I asked how she was feeling. She stated that she was feeling better so i had her sit the rest of the way up with her feet hanging over the bed. I asked how she was feeling. She stated that she was feeling good. I then had her stand up with me standing in front of her and asked how she was feeling. She stated that she was feeling light headed in the middle of her forehead. I had her sit back down and gave her an ice pack to put on her neck. I then asked how she was feeling and she stated that she was feeling better and while she had the ice pack on her forehead she kept eating and drinking. I then had her stand up and she stated that she was better. i took her vitals at 11:24 am heart rate 75, o2 99 and BP 115/81, again at 11:30 am heart rate 79, o2 97 and BP 117/82.

                                                5/5/21 Wednesday -  got 2nd Pfizer Shot. 5/6/21  Thursday - 2am awoke with shakes/chills and throughout the day had body aches, temperature increased from 98.6 to 101.2, stiffness, nausea, headache, chills and sweats.  5/7/21 Friday symptoms continued from previous day but had strong abdominal pain. I went to my doctor and they suspected I could have appendicitis and also symptoms from the vaccine. They suggested going to the ER after 3 days if systems persisted. I went home after the doctor visit and was nauseous. I had sprite, ate white rice and chicken broth. My abdomen felt a bit better but I had a bad headache. 5/8/21 - Saturday I awoke at 6am with stabbing/burning chest pain that increased as time progressed. The chest pain was increasing and getting worse after 1 hour and 30 minutes. The pain was in the middle of my chest. My mom took me to the Emergency Room.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

Thursday night, My heart started racing very quickly and it lasted for 30 minutes - my whole chest was hurting really bad and my heart was beating hard. I had a monitor  - 207 beats per minutes. Blood pressure was normal. ER - monitored my heart. I think they gave me some medication. They gave me a heart monitor to check my heart for next 14 days. There was not another occurrence.

Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

                                                Chills; chest tightness; minor fatigue; joint and muscle pain throughout the body (injection site in upper left arm; shoulder; back; ankles). Injection site soreness began immediately after the vaccine, but is normal for me. Everything else began at time listed on this form (1/25/2021 afternoon) and ended by the following morning. I took one Tylenol to help with the chills and pain about 5 hours after symptoms started and it seemed to help a little.

No other local or systemic allergic type signs or symptoms noted.  Client appeared anxious and admitted to same.  Responding well to reassurance.  She normally takes hydroxyzine PRN for anxiety, and we offered diphenhydramine which she accepted (50mg po x 1).  Feeling improved prior to discharge, this is NOT suspected to be a severe adverse reaction to the vaccine (suspect panic/anxiety).

                                                chest pain; tachycardia; cold sweats; shakes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional. A 20-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on an unspecified date (at the age of 20-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) administered in arm left on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient ended up in the hospital with chest pain, tachycardia, shakes and cold sweats, 5 hours after receiving second dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: unknown results on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine can not be excluded for the reported events of chest pain, tachycardia, shakes and cold sweats due to temporal relationship.  Case will be re-assessed upon the additional information provided. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Roughly 12 hours after I recieved my second dose of the vaccine (around 11:00 PM on 3/26) I started to develop a fever, headache, and chills. These symptoms lasted throughout the night into the morning. In the morning on Saturday (3/27), and for most of the day I felt fatigued and slightly nauseous. At 5:00 PM that night, I was walking in the hall of my residence when I experienced a syncopal episode, which has never happened to me before. I fainted several times and my roommate brought me to the ER. Other than low BP, my EKG and other vitals looked fine, and the doctor sent me home with the conclusion it was likley related to the vaccine. The next day, Sunday 3/28, I felt naseua and dizziness all day.

EMS was called to the scene and the patient was evaluated after having a near syncopal episode just prior to their arrival.  EMS stayed on scene for approximately 30 minutes and evaluated the patient in the ambulance.  Staff was advised that the patient ended up feeling better after evaluation and refused care from EMS, leaving with her family.  No further information was obtained.

                                                Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. Upon administration, patient reported she felt as though she was having an anxiety attack. She then fainted and started falling forward in her chair. The pharmacist and technician caught the patient as she fell forward and as they were leaning her back in the chair she began seizing in their arms for approximately 5-10 seconds (no more than 20-30 seconds). At this point, the patient spoke and stated that was weird and said she felt lethargic. Another technician was on the phone with 911 at this time. We gave her a bottle of water and kept the patient seated in the immunization room until EMS arrived. She was complaining of being very hot and lethargic. EMS arrived and checked her vitals and recommended the patient go with them to the hospital due to B/P and pulse being very low (exact vitals were not communicated to us). She agreed to go to the hospital and we will be following up with the patient tomorrow.

I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

The emergency provider ruled out the chest pains as NOT being cardiac or Gastrointestinal related after doing countless blood tests and other various tests. I then followed up with my PCP and they said to keep an eye on it to see if it got any worse and to seek medical attention if the chest pains did get worse. After 4 days the pain went away.

A 21-year-old non-pregnant female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot number: En9265, intramuscular on 13Feb2021 at 14:00 (at the age of 21 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient fainted and was hyporesponsive on 13Feb2021. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Feb2021. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on vaccine-event chronological association, a causal relationship between events fainted and was hyporesponsive and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She said she didn&#39;t feel well, and she didn&#39;t want lunch. Then she went and vomited. We took her temperature, and it was normal. We talked to her, made sure she was oriented. She then had a bout of diarrhea in the bathroom. It took about an hour for her color to completely come back and for her to feel better. She called Pfizer and spoke to them to make a report. They told her they have not had reports like this a few days after the vaccine was given. We were not sure if she should have the 2nd round or not.

I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

                                                I received my shot at 11:47 and started to lose sensation in my hands in the waiting area. After about 25 minutes I felt dizzy and was about to stand up but my muscles started shaking. My heart rate was checked and found to be 140. This lasted for about another 30 minutes. My heart rate went down and I was taken to a private area and checked out by EMS they gave me water and concluded it was some sort of panic attack. However, these are the same symptoms I have whenever I am allergic to a medication, NSAIDS, dicyclomine, etc. It always starts with ascending numbness from my fingers to the rest of my body. Then I start to shake and my heart rate goes way up. Usually I start to cough then vomit and my airway closes. Thankfully this time we were able to slow the process and I never experienced some of the last symptoms.

                                                Patient experienced syncope after administration of her first COVID vaccine. Her mother is a physician and was present, providing care for her by fanning, comforting and helping her to lie down on the floor next to the waiting chairs. The patient did not faint. She did experience what appeared to be heavy breathing and light-headedness. We provided an ice pack from the immunization cart. The mother stated that the patient experiences this reaction every time she receives a vaccine due to her fear of needles. After about 30 minutes the patient was up and smiling. The family was thankful for our concern and help.

                                                i received my vaccine right about 12:30 that money and while waiting in the 15 minute clinic at the center i felt relatively fine aside for a dry mouth which i didn&#39;t even thing was a adverse reaction at the time. i processed to continue with my day and head to my 2pm class and while sitting in my class my throat which at this point was pretty itchy and felt like it was to some extent tightening. I also started to cough and wheeze profusely which is something im use to as an asthma patient but usually something has to induce that and at this point i was literally just sitting in class. i left the class and at this point it was getting extremely hard for me to breath i was coughing and wheezing essentially in a full on asthma attack. i drove to the clinic where they first gave me an albuterol nebulizer and then tried to give me a Claritin but just a few minutes after i threw up we tried again with a Benadryl and while i was able to keep that in longer i also threw up after taking that medicine. After my breathing calmed down a bit i was released to go home but there i had a fever and headache, body chills, extreme fatigue, exhaustion. nausea and  abdominal oain in my lower left side and right below my breast bone. for the rest of the night and even into today (march 23). i continued to take both Benadryl and the nebulizer over night and that has worked to help releeve symptoms but i still feel significantly unwell.

The medical professional tending to her had her continue talking, asked her to state her DOB, name, age, the date, etc.  After about 5 minutes she started to feel better- she sat up and had some water and M&amp;Ms. She then laid back down but continued to converse with us. This took place over about10 minutes from first symptoms. She remained laying down for about 10 minutes after and then slowly sat up, and when she felt comfortable sitting she tried standing up. She then went home for the day (was an employee of the store).

                                                Around 10 minutes after getting the shot, felt sudden wave of light headedness/dizziness. About 40 minutes prior I had a snack and immediately after the shot I had another snack. I also had been drinking water. At one point I felt that I was close to passing out. I also had tingling/numbness in my feet/legs in certain positions and had to move them. I went through the drive through for the vaccine and so I sat in the car drinking water and breathing deeply for about 20-30 minutes. It gradually got better but never fully gone. When I got home some of the light headedness got a little worse when I had to stand up and walk even though I did it slowly. Even an hour after, side effects still lingering and have not yet gone as I fill this out.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm on 11Mar2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low thyroid. There were no concomitant medications. After receiving the shot of the vaccine on 11Mar2021 16:00, the patient stood up and started to feel dizzy. She was able to find a nearby chair and fainted when she sat down. When she woke up seconds later of fainting, she felt throat pain like strep throat pain and then she started feeling very intensive cramps in her lower abdomen like very intense period cramps for about 10 minutes. The patient stated that nobody in the (Pharmacy name) was prepared to react to these symptoms and the rescue took too long to come in, when they came in she was feeling better and did not see the need of going to the hospital. But it was an immediate reaction that affected 3 different parts of her body that was very painful. During the day and the day after she felt very weak with no energy to get out of bed. &#34;I am wondering if I can still receive the second dose after this reaction to the first dose?&#34; No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient was not pregnant. No known allergies. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a pharmacy drug store. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Patient felt anxious prior to coming for vaccine due to last minute sign up.  Right after getting the vaccine she experienced her throat tightening - stated she felt off- was shaky, lightheaded and heart racing. She came to the observation station- while sitting for observation she felt she wanted to get away from everyone else and came to the check in desk. Her symptoms started to subside when I escorted her to the recliner.  I gave her some Gatorade   bP 90/60 pulse 80.  She was feeling less anxious   O2 sat done at 11:51 99 % she stated she was feeling fine .  repeat BP 104/60 p 60 at noon.  I checked with lead at the clinic who agreed she should stay till 12:10 She felt fine when she left this nurse discussed the plan if she needed help would be to go to urgent care or call police if it was urgent.

I was fine with these symptoms as I knew they were common side effects until my heart rate spiked from about 60 to the 160s and I began to have a throbbing headache. I could not get my heart rate to come down, I was calm and knew it was not anxiety so I went to the ER where they did blood tests, EKG, UA and gave me fluids. Everything came back normal but my heart rate continued to be elevated around 130s for a couple more hours, finally came down to about 100-110, HR is still slightly elevated and I still have a fever of 100.4 and migraine

                                                4 hours after receiving my Pfizer COVID vaccination, my chest started to tighten up and I became short of breath. I took some Ibuprofen, but the pain is still there today, and it is hard for me to even walk up the stairs without becoming short of breath or being in pain.

Was feeling well prior to that.  Has soreness at her arm as well.  She has a history of POTS and did detect a rapid heart rate at home.  She has mild sinus tachycardia at this time reports a gradual improvement in symptoms.  Fever is improving, had not had any antipyretic prior to coming in.  I have low suspicion for acute infection and would favor immune response to the vaccine itself which has been reported in multiple persons receiving same vaccine.

Pain is mostly at top of my lungs, going across my chest. Deep breathing sometimes helps but there?s also pain upon inhalation.  * Took the next doses of Advair and my Dexedrine (ADHD meds). Nothing weird yet just drained.   They switched my Ventolin inhaler to ProAir, I have been taking it about five times a week so I can workout. When I was on Ventolin I didn?t have any of the side effects I have with ProAir.

                                                Patient is a registered nurse at facility.  She reported having slight itchy lips and scratchy throat after 1st dose.  Patient very much wanted full protection that 2nd dose offers in order to be safe and keep family members safe.  We discussed the possibility of an increased reaction, but she wanted to go ahead and felt the benefits outweighed the risk.  I considered the fact that she is a health care professional, was fully informed and that we were at a skilled nursing facility and were prepared in case she had any reaction.  About 10 minutes after vaccination she seemed to be coughing and felt like her throat was maybe swelling.  She seemed to be breathing ok, but I asked her to take a Benadryl, which she did.  Within 5-10 minutes after that she began shaking and seemed very pale.  She said her symptoms were getting worse.  I told her I was going to administer an epi-pen dose.  911 was called, I administered the epipen, we had heart rate monitor and pulse ox monitor on patient and she was stable, but scared.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported patient to ER.  She was later released with Benadryl.

                                                About 5 mins after the shot I received on Sunday, I got a cooling effect in my chest and began to feel a bit off with an elevated HR of 132. I raised my hand to talk to a nurse and she said I was probably just nervous, got me a water, and said to continue to monitor symptoms. Then, after 15 minutes were up with no other symptoms I left the facility where I got the vaccine. The rest of the day I began to get a burning and cooling effect all around my sternum. It persisted through the day despite Tylenol 500 mg and worsened at night, keeping me up along with a slight fever and chills. The next morning I awoke with slightly lowered symptoms but the sternum pain would flare up on and off through the day and again was worse at night on Monday. So, I took a Benadryl and a 500 mg Tylenol and slept great. I woke up Tuesday feeling great with no fever and minimal chills and no sternal pain. I thought since I hit the 48 hour mark everything was going fine and I was recovering. I ran some errands and even went to the gym to do a mild workout. Then at about 6pm all the symptoms of the sternal pain flared up and was just as bad as Monday night. I took another 500mg Tylenol and 1 Benadryl again and they did not seem to work or help nearly as much as the night before. I woke up this morning with some pain in my sternum again and did not sleep much last night due to the pain as well. I have not taken any further medications at this time and I am also experiencing the worst fatigue I have so far today.

It would go back and forth between normal heart rate and the highest it got was 175bpm. After a week of this going on I followed up with my PCP had an EKG done and saw I had sinus Tachycardia. They put me on a Beta blocker from now until 2 weeks after my second dose to see if that slows my heart rate down.

I wasn?t given any treatment after they identified  my EKG and vitals were normal and was discharged quickly.   I feel fine right now.

Emergency Room doctors say it was very likely related to an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer Covid vaccination. Treatment included Tylenol and Ibuprofen, rest, and fluids.

                                                Developed a whole body rash 6 days after my first Pfizer vaccine. The rash was very large and covered about 80% of my body. The rash consisted of redness, small bruise spots and extreme itching. I self treated myself by taking several cool showers and took acetaminophen two times two capsules. On the second day, blotches are subsiding but I have fatigue and weariness in limbs. Skin is less red but has a sallow color and blotchy which is unusual.

                                                On Monday at around 2pm I started having severe pain in my chest near my right breast, and as the day progressed it got worse with a horrible migraine. It began to radiate to the left, and Wednesday I went to Urgent Care because I was scared. My EKG &amp; chest x-ray were clear. Today I feel even worse with migraines, chest pain (that radiates up my neck and around my back), and overall feeling gross and exhausted. My head is what?s bothering me the most along with my joint pain.

                                                Shortly after being given the vaccine the person had an episode of near-syncope where she felt light-headed and was not feeling well.  She has had a history of this occurring in the past after an injection before (unknown if vaccination or other IM injection) and blood draws.  She did not have any loss of conscious, but she became pale and diaphoretic and felt like she could pass out if she would stand consistent with a vasovagal event.

Over the next several days she had migraines, fever, nausea, diarrhea.  She had a very heavy period that was not normal for her.  She was treated twice for presumed UTI (once with macrobid and then with cefuroxime) in the days after the vaccine though cultures ended up negative.  She was referred to me, a hematologist, when she was noted to have a dropping hemoglobin and platelet count.  She appears to have a Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and possibly ITP.  She is feeling a little better but her labs remain abnormal.  Please note this was reported on Pfizer website as well but I have not been contacted.  Guidance would be sincerely appreciated.  My cell phone was provided.

Was with her mom, in case she had an issue. Vaccination without incident.  Kept pt at the vaccination area to observe.  About three minutes after receiving the vaccination, pt started to shake.  Was conversing.  Stated she was warm, so got her a cold bottle of water.  Stated she was dizzy so helped her to the floor to lay down.

Her condition worsened to feeling nauseous and blurred vision, so patient asked to lie down.  We found a quiet area in the employee break room for the patient to lay down.  and provided her a pillow, water, cool compress for her head, and later, orange juice for her comfort. We proceeded to call 911 for medical attention. EMS professionals evaluated patient&#39;s vital signs and patient signed waiver refusing to go to hospital, since she was feeling better. Patient left on her own accord with a friend driving her home.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events Coombs negative hemolytic anemia, Within minutes of 2nd dose of vaccine, pt had urination of dark brown urine, Migraine, Fever, Nausea, Diarrhea, Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 06Mar down to 8.3 11Mar, She had a max AST 206 09Mar down to 118 11Mar and ALT 93 10Mar now 86 11Mar. Outcome of all the events  was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  Coombs negative hemolytic anemia and other events  due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The technician confirmed that patient&#39;s friend was driving her home and the pharmacist cleared her to leave after she spent a total of 30 minutes in the pharmacy.

I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

                                                On April 5th, 2021 I went to the E.D. , for shortness of breath and severe right shoulder pain. While there they got a chest x-ray, ran labs, and did a chest CT. The CT revealed that I had one blood clot in my left lung and two blood clots in my right lung, as well as slight pleural effusion in the right lower lobe. They put me on Xarelto for the next 3-6 months and monthly follow up visits with my primary care provider. I was also given Hydrocodone as need. I experienced extreme pain with breathing and sort of movement for a week and half but currently only have occasional shoulder and back pain usually at the end of the day.

The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2.

A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 17Apr2021 at 09:10 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included penicillin allergy from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing, asthma from an unspecified date (diagnosed at 4 years old and it is usually controlled with medications) and ongoing and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome from 2019 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccination and did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient previously received the flu shot on an unspecified date for immunization and experienced allergic to flu shot preservative and the patient previously received Biaxin on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication and experienced allergy. On 17Apr2021 at 09:12 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactic shock; on 17Apr2021 the patient experienced throat feels tight, ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that comes and goes and then it will be on her chest , face, neck and shoulders and migrates wherever; on 18Apr2021 the patient experienced ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat; on 20Apr2021 the patient experienced dark purple on face; on 24Apr2021 the patient experienced some trouble breathing and chest pain; on 25Apr2021 the patient experienced a lot of bone pain; on 26Apr2021 the patient experienced white blood cell counts are all elevated and on unspecified dates the patient experienced face and neck swells, tachycardia, feels like she is having an asthma attack, blotch, blood counts continue to become worse and asthma worse. The reporter called to report that her daughter received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 17Apr2021 and that her side effects started two minutes later (also reported as 4 minutes later). The patient experienced anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. She stated that her daughter continued to have anaphylactic reactions and had to go to the hospital every day since then. The clinical course was reported as follows: her daughter and her husband went to get the vaccine together on 17Apr2021. They went to a facility giving the Pfizer vaccine, and the reporter stated that her daughter was asked, and she did tell them, that she could not receive the flu vaccine that had the additives in it because she was allergic to it. The reporter stated that her daughter was not taking the flu shot for years. She stated that her daughter was allergic to Biaxin but could take Zithromax because of the different additives. They had no idea what the preservative was, but it was obviously in the flu shot so they stopped getting the flu shot until they stopped putting the preservative in the vaccine. The reporter stated that her daughter received the COVID-19 vaccine and within two minutes her daughter told her dad that she was having a hard time breathing. Her daughter walked over to the city EMS who were on site and told them that she was having a hard time breathing. They treated her and then took her to hospital via ambulance. She was treated at the hospital and they were hesitant to discharge her because they were worried about her bounce back. This was exactly what has happened. Every night since the vaccine she has had to take her daughter into the hospital. Every day was a nightmare of either EpiPen injections, Tagamet, Benadryl or prednisone and ended up in the ER every day, where they give her IV Benadryl and send her home. The caller stated that her daughter&#39;s symptoms start with ginormous welts and then an itching to the back of the throat. She had seen a ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that came and went and then it would be on her chest, face, neck and shoulders and migrated wherever. She saw dark purple on her daughter&#39;s face yesterday before she went to the ER. Her skin will blotch, and she will say that her throat feels tight like when she had a reaction to penicillin. She stated that her daughter used to get this when she they would give her penicillin; she would have that reaction every time she got penicillin and they finally said she was allergic to it. The caller states that after those symptoms started, she called EMS and they took her to a hospital. The caller stated she took her daughter to another hospital and they medicated her with IV Benadryl and fluids. Her primary care doctor told the emergency room staff to discharge the patient and that he would give her specific medications to go home with. He called in the medications, but they did not work. He gave her specific medication that did not work, half of her face was turning purple. The purple face was then replaced by an area approximately 1 inch wide on cheek between temple and the jaw. It was 1.5 inches long and was red and looked like a rash or welt. The patient would take an inhaler when she started to have breathing difficulties. That was when the reporter was like &#34;here she goes again&#34;. It felt like it almost made her asthma worse and had to treat that as well. There was a little oddity when they did blood work on her daughter and her white blood count was high and was probably her body reacting to the COVID-19 vaccine. So, she went back to the hospital. The nurses said there was nothing they could do for her, and she needed to find an allergist. The reporter stated that she was tired of the ER visits and wanted her daughter to get better. She stated that she doubled the dose of her daughter&#39;s Tagamet. She stated that the patient&#39;s face and neck swells and she would get tachycardia. The reporter stated that she would not take her daughter to the hospital anymore. The hospital did not think it could be related to the vaccine, but she had not done anything else. The reporter wanted to report this event because she did not think people were taking this seriously. She stated that no one believed it was related to the vaccine, so they were not getting help. She wanted to know if this was a side effect and what could she do about it. She also inquired on whether her daughter should get the second shot. She stated that her daughter would not get the second shot. She had heard that if you had any reaction to the vaccine, then you should not receive the second dose. Her daughter&#39;s doctors have told her to receive the second vaccine. The reporter also stated that she wondered if this was some mast cell activation due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The reporter also asked if Pizer made a preservative free vaccine. Upon follow-up received on 27Apr2021, the patient called to report that she was still experiencing side effects from the anaphylactic reaction and it had been 10 days since administration. She was told it would last about 4-10 days and then be gone, but it had continued, and it had been over 10 days. She had no new symptoms, other than a lot of bone pain. The bone pain made it feel like her bones were shattering. She went to the ER yesterday where they did blood work and said that all of her white blood cell counts were elevated. The anaphylaxis lasted from 17Apr2021 and subsided in that sense on 24Apr2021.  Since then she still had the chest pain, some trouble breathing, and felt like she was having an asthma attack. She had been back and forth to the ER several times since 17Apr2021. The ER kept ruling her symptoms as a reaction to the vaccine. She had been using epinephrine as needed. The patient stated that she was not planning on receiving the second dose due to her reaction. She wanted to know where she should go from here. She wanted to know if this would last forever and how much longer could her symptoms last. The clinical outcomes of the events ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat and a lot of bone pain were not recovered/not resolved; dark purple on face was recovered/resolved on 21Apr2021; outcomes of all other events were unknown.

I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

                                                I received the COVID19 vaccine on January 22, 2021. I started to have chest tightness and somewhat of a dry cough midday on Monday January 25, which continued until January 27. I started having congestion and runny nose on January 27, so I went and got tested for COVID on the 27. The test came back positive on January 28. On January 28 I had extreme congestion and head pressure, a bad burning sensation from my left sinus that went back to my left 2nd molar, and a runny nose. I had not gone anywhere the week prior due to studying for an exam besides to lab at school twice where everyone was socially distanced and was wearing a mask the whole time. The highest my temperature got was 99.4 with Tylenol on January 28. In addition to this, my husband got covid tested on January 28 to see if he had it, or had given covid to me and his test came back negative. We had not socially distanced and still had physical contact the entire time, and continued not to do so in our house. We have had full contact the entire time because he is working from home and most of my school is online, and he got tested again on January 30 and came back negative again. If somehow I got covid from school in a short amount of time with everyone wearing a mask, how would he not get covid from me after a full week of exposure unless I was not contagious, which makes me think I somehow got it from the vaccine. I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, as I got the shingles when I was 4 as a direct result from the first chickenpox vaccine.

                                                29 minutes after being given the vaccine my tongue started itching and swelled up a bit, my mouth felt dry, my face became a bit reddened, puffy, and itchy, my throat began to swell a bit and my chest felt tight, giving me some discomfort when it came to breathing. I let the nurses who were keeping an eye on those waiting for 15/30 minutes know that I was having a reaction. I waited 1 more minute, and when my throat felt tighter and I had a bit more difficulty breathing, I took 1 Benadryl tablet, and waited 2 minutes, and when the symptoms were still worsening slowly, I took a second Benadryl tablet and after a few minutes my symptoms started to go away.  I waited another 10 minutes and then went home when it seemed that my symptoms were going away.  At 6:45pm on 2/21/2021 my throat and chest started feeling tight again and gave me mild breathing discomfort, so I took another Benadryl tablet, a few minutes later my face began to itchy and my mouth felt dry and my tongue felt a bit swollen, whereupon I took a second Benadryl tablet at 6:56pm, and then felt a wave of nausea.  At 6:59pm, the feeling of tightness had not abated, but also hadn&#39;t worsened noticeably, and the itching feeling began to spread from my face to my ears and down my neck.  At 7:04pm the tightness of my throat and chest began to increase some, and I started to feel some anxiety.  At 7:11pm I inhaled two puffs from an albuterol inhaler used for treating asthma as my throat and chest were continuing to slowly get tighter.  At 7:26pm I still felt itchy and my throat and chest still felt tight, but it wasn&#39;t noticeably worse.  At 7:35pm, my throat began to feel tight enough to give me noticeable discomfort while breathing and for me to make a slight wheezing sound while breathing, and my tongue felt like it swelled a bit more, and my mouth still felt dry.  At 7:51pm the Benadryl made me feel sleepy, but had no effect on my itchy skin or tightness of throat or chest.  8:00pm, my throat and chest felt tighter and I started having some difficulty swallowing and I felt very warm.  8:05pm, I had a lot of difficulty swallowing and had trouble breathing, so I went to the Emergency Room and was given an Epinephrine shot and sent home after an hour of observation.

After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, developed &#34;blackening&#34; vision and then lost consciousness. Uncertain about time of loss of consciousness. Other symptoms included pallor, fast heart rate, sweating, nausea and loss of bladder function. No treatment required, seen in the ED and recovered without treatment.   Because she was driving a car at the time, she rear-ended the car in front of her and the airbags deployed. Underwent evaluation for motor vehicle accident as well in the ED with no injuries noted.

Immunizer notified me/pharmacist of patient&#39;s history and staff was informed to watch her for any adverse events.  5-10 minutes later patient walked up to counsel window and notified pharmacist she was going to faint.  I asked her to please return to her seat and immediately a technician and I went out and assisted her to a chair.  We provided a bottle of water and advised her to sip some.  After a few more minutes she passed out in the chair.  At that point we called 911.  The operator advised us to lay her flat.  We moved her into the training room and waited for EMT to arrive.  They arrived a few minutes later.  At that point she was beginning to come around.  I left to return to pharmacy as she was being cared for.  20 minutes later the EMT consulted me and patient vitals were good and she was feeling much better and refused to be transported to hospital.  I signed off their form as a witness of her refusal.

Outcome of event seizure was not recovered; outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient had underlying epilepsy.

Started having intense chest pain around 10 AM- felt like pressure on my chest and almost squeezing, it kind of shot out and I could feel it in my throat and in my headache. It was still happening around 1 PM so I went to the ER after calling urgent care but the pain subsided once I was at the ER. Nausea, dizziness, haziness, and headache were on and off the rest of the day, subsiding around 6 PM.

Patient received vaccine and about one minute later the patient passed out and fell forward. I was able to catch her and lower to the ground safely. I called for pharmacist on duty to assist in the care of the patient. Less than a minute after the patient passed out she was awake and alert.  The patient was asked multiple times if she needed to go to the hospital and asked if she was okay to drive home.  She insisted that she faints frequently from vaccines and denied any further care.

                                                I noticed a petechia rash on my legs the day after I received the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, April 06, 2021, I noticed the rash spreading around my chest area, neck area, thighs, and arms as the following days progressed. On Friday, April 09, 2021, I made an appointment at the Student Health Center where I was seen by clinician,  who requested I get blood labs done. After results showed that my platelet count was 30,000, she immediately referred me to the ER at Hospital. She informed that it was an adverse side effect to my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she also informed me that it was a very rare instance and there are cases of other individuals that this has also happened to. Dr. informed me my situation was extremely dangerous and could have potentially been fatal if I had not decided to seek medical attention. I was admitted into the  Hospital on April 09, and was discharged on Monday, April 12, 2021. While I was in the hospital, that Friday 04/09 I received a blood transfusion for my low platelet count, it did not show much improvement, I was diagnosed with ITP by clinician  who is a clinician within the Hematology and Oncology department.  Dr. also informed me that this seemed to be an adverse side effect to the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine, Dr.then recommended I receive steroids for 4 consecutive days to increase my platelet count. The date of my discharge 04/12, my platelet count was 20,000 which is still considered extremely low but due to steroids that were given to me for 4 days, Dr.agreed that this would hopefully increase my platelet count.

Received 2nd covid vaccination last week- mild reaction with fever thereafter.  She had w/u in the ED including an EKG with inferior and septal TWI and trop of 1.61.  CTA chest was negative.  She was admitted.  After admit, troponin trended up (1.61--3.71--4.93).  CRP 49.1, ESR 21.   Echo showed apex hypokinesis so with TWI on EKG and elevated trop, cardiology elected for LHC.  This was normal.  Cardiac MRI showed myopericarditis. She was started on high dose ASA, colchicine and bblocker for this.  Likely viral etiology (Covid, Resp 4 plex negative).  Trop trended down on 4/13 (CRP still rising).  Cardiology was ok with discharge.  Will need 2 weeks of ASA and 3 months of colchicine.  No strenuous activities for that time frame.  She is getting her Masters in music/violin and did not need a return to school note.   Feeling somewhat better at discharge- rated pain 6/10.    Internal Medicine followup in 1 week Cardiology followup in 2 months

The patient woke up and was standing for about 3 minutes to refill water when she got super nauseous. She was making her way to the bathroom to throw up, and the next thing she knew she was on the floor. The patient was not sure how long she was passed out for though she had no reason to believe it was long. She tried to sit up, but she really wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she laid back down and closed her eyes for a bit. Then she got super hot and sweaty. Once that passed (maybe a few more minutes), she was able to check her temperature and she was down to around 101 and was able to get back to bed. No treatment for the events. No COVID prior vaccination. The patient had not been COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in Apr2021.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

I checked my temperature but that was normal, around 97 F. I tried different positions to make breathing easier but the pressure would not lift. Around 3 AM I used my (expired) inhaler. Almost immediately I could feel my chest getting lighter. I used my inhaler again around 10 am. The chest tightness did not lift a noticable amount until around 2 PM. By 5 PM all tightness had subsided.

                                                I felt very fatigued starting around 6pm. Severe chills began around 9pm, followed by a fever. The fever went from 100.1 to 102.2 over the course of about an hour (11:30pm-12:30pm), at which time I took 400mg of ibuprofen. The fever was 102.1 thirty minutes after taking the ibuprofen. Along with the fever I experienced tachycardia, body and muscle aches, and moderate to severe deltoid pain at the injection site. I believe the fever broke around 3:00am. The fatigue and body aches lasted about 24 hours since they began, but the majority  of the rest of my symptoms were gone after the fever. The arm pain at injection site was noticeable and painful for about 72 hours before subsiding.

                                                Third day after receiving the vaccine I have been continuously experiencing sparatic and sharp pains mainly in my chest but also in my stomach and occasionally my back. It mainly shows up in my chest. Sharp and achey pains all in different spots at different times. This has been occurring now for 6 days and has not gotten better with time or any medicine I?ve been instructed to take by physician. Sometimes it throbs, sometimes it aches, sometimes it?s sharp and sudden. There is no consistency other than how painful it is. The pain has gotten more intense this evening 1/19/21. I have not experienced more than a half hour without any pain. It has been ongoing since 1/13/21. I woke up last night at 2:45am with a throbbing pain on the left side of my chest.

                                                In addition to arm pain for two days, I also had chest pains/tightness. I felt the chest tightness the morning after getting the vaccine. The chest tightness continued until 1/23.  It was not a constant pain, but sometimes when I would move a certain way, my chest would hurt. The spot that hurt is right in the middle of my chest. It got worse when I would exercise and breathe heavily. The chest pain continued to stop and come back for several weeks. The night after I received the vaccine, I felt dizzy and felt as if I would pass out, but did not. This only happened one time and was better when I woke up the next morning.   The weekend after I got the vaccine, I was worried I might have covid, so I got tested for covid, but the results came back negative.

My face turned bright red and my heart rate increased to 152 beats per minute.  My respirations became very labored and my blood pressure was 187/97. I was monitored for 30 minutes afterwards. The nurse placed ice packs on the back of my neck to cool down. She continually monitored my vital signs. Upon leaving my blood pressure was still elevated, but improved.

When I got home the body aches got worse and I started getting severe chills and could not stop shaking. That night was difficult to sleep because of the pain I was in. When I woke up the next day, 01/30/2021, I was dizzy, severe fatigue, had severe migraines, I could not breathe when standing up and moving around, my heart was racing, and it felt like I had a sun burn all over my body. I called the nursing coordinator for that day and asked what to do and she said to go to the ER. When I arrived at the ER, they said I had 100 degree temp., I was tacky. They gave me medicine for the pain and the doctor said I was having a adverse reaction to the vaccine but by the next day I would feel better.

                                                Patient was given second dose.  30 minutes later she sat down on a couch and was breathing short and shallow.  She was not responsive and mildly shaking.  I gave her an Epipen shot and in less than a minute she was a wake and feeling much better.  She drank some water.  911 was not called because her mother was a nurse and was nearby.  She came and picked her up and took her to a doctor.  I checked on the patient this afternoon and she is feeling fine other than feeling tired.  She has a medical history of weight loss surgery and not dieting properly.  The administrator of the home  said she has a history of not feeling well and almost fainting from not eating properly after her weight loss surgery.

My heart rate was consistently in the 110s-120s and my blood pressure was in the 100s/40s. My highest temperature was 103.5. My fiancé is a nurse who took care of me at home. I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen for the aches and fever. I slept the majority of each day and was unable to perform my activities of daily life or exercise. I lost my appetite for about 1 week. I had no sense of taste in Sunday, which slowly returned over the next week. I was concerned about the loss of taste so I scheduled a COVID-19 swab which came back negative on 1/11.

She declined water and asked for &#34;a snack.&#34; I re-evaluated her approximately every 5 minutes over the next half hour.

A 24-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3247), intramuscular in left arm on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included generalised anxiety and allergies: Sulfa sensitive. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Jan2021, 45-60 minutes after vaccination, patient experienced hallucination, severe confusion, dizziness/light headedness, disorientation, fatigue, tachycardia, anxiety, full body weakness, then on 22Jan2021, 8 hours after, patient had full body muscle aches, headache, chills, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, anxiety, tachycardia, 16 hours after, experienced  confusion, full body muscle aches, headache, chills, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, tachycardia, anxiety, then 48 hours after, had confusion, full body muscle aches (TYLENOL helped), headache, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, tachycardia, anxiety, then 1 week after vaccination, patient was experiencing confusion, anxiety, and hallucinations throughout the entire week. Patient was unsure if she ever had a fever, as she did not check her temperature. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID saliva test: negative on 27Jan2021 and negative on 10Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of full body muscle aches. No treatment was received for the other adverse events. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported event hallucination cannot be completely excluded given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I am now 30 weeks pregnant and the reason I went to see my hematologist is because my platelets dropped. I had lab work done the week of 02-22-2021 through 02-26-2021. I also had soreness at the injection site and a palpable lymph node under my armpit that was present for 24 hours then it resolved. I will also be receiving treatment with IV, IG and prednisone medication starting this week of 03-15-2021 through       03-19-2021.

I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

Symptoms started 20 minutes following administration of vaccine and resolved about 30 minutes thereafter.  EMS came - thought it could be related to anxiety.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; brand: Pfizer Biotech; lot number: EL0142) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 30Dec2020 at 12:45 PM at a single dose (dose number: 1) for COVID-19 immunization. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was workplace clinic. Medical history included premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). No known allergies (no allergies to medications, food, or other products). The patient was not pregnant. No other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced adverse events included blood pressure dropped to 70/50, heart rate went up to 140, whole body got cold and tingly and she got tunnel vision and almost passed out. The events all started on 30Dec2020 at 12:45 PM. The events were reported as non-serious. No treatment received for events. The outcome of events was resolving. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tunnel vision with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

On 1/1 the itching started spreading throughout my body. I have continuously been itching since 12/31. The itching is all over my scalp, arms, hands, back, and legs. I have recently developed a pain/pressure in the back of my head, that feels like I have smacked it against a wall. I have also recently developed pain in my chest. I have seen my PCP, dermatologist, and ED drs and no one can find a route cause for my reaction.

Information on batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event &#34;feeling like she was going to vomit&#34; was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other reported serious events with BNT 162b2 can not be completely excluded.

Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events.

I then called him back 4 minutes later and failed to form words, and also could not type words. I felt like I was going to faint and have no recollection of 10 minutes during that time. I had to leave work to go to the emergency room.  I had a massive headache for 3 days following my TIA.

                                                15 hours after vaccine, I woke up with a severe headache and extreme fatigue. 18 hours after vaccine, I showered and felt very dizzy. I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

Throat started to close up, tingling sensation throughout entire body, rush of heat, dizziness, increased heart rate. Made it back to the site (closest medical professionals near me) where my throat still felt swollen but I could breathe. Chest hurt and was still dizzy. Was given 50mg Benadryl &amp; 20mg Pepsid. It seemed to come and go in waves but I still went to the ER. ER doc said what he saw I was experiencing was anxiety. Pharmacist who had been with me the whole time could tell that my neck and throat had been swollen but had gone down with the Benadryl. ER administered anti nausea meds and a steroid shot. Also prescribed steroids for a few days. Received the shot at 6:45, initial reaction occurred around 7:10, went to the ER around 8:45

I felt light headed and I don&#39;t get that with my panic attacks; At 15 minutes, my heart was beating really fast. They checked my vitals - pulse and BP was elevated. Pulse is over 130 and normally when I have an anxiety attack it doesn&#39;t go above 110. Went to the  ER . The breathing felt better after thirty min after being in ER and Blood pressure 1-2 hours later went down. No treatment. After about two weeks I saw my primary care doctor for check up.

The day prior to testing positive I had been notified that I had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive. I did not have any symptoms when I tested positive on 12/28/20 except for a headache later that night. The next day I felt fatigued and had nasal congestion. On 12/30/20, i noticed that I had lost my sense of smell and my sense of taste was altered. I also felt mild chest tightness however my o2 sats remained above 95%. The congestion and fatigue only lasted for two days and my sense of smell and taste had come back by 1/1/21. The chest tightness has persisted even now after testing negative but has diminished over time and occurs less frequently.

A non-pregnant 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3246), intramuscular in left arm, on 15Jan2021 at 14:15, at 0.3 mL, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amfetamine aspartate monohydrate/ amfetamine sulfate/ dexamfetamine saccharate/ dexamfetamine sulfate (MYDAYIS), buspirone hydrochloride (BUSPAR), and ethinylestradiol/ norethisterone acetate (MICROGESTIN). The patient previously took cefotaxime sodium (OMNICEF) and amoxicillin sodium/clavulanate potassium (AUGMENTIN) and experienced allergies to both drugs. The patient worked on a COVID-19 study. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. On 18Jan2021 at 03:00 AM, the patient had a pounding heart rate beginning two days after vaccination and had felt faint. The patient received her first dose on Friday and then last night (3 AM; also reported as 2-3 AM) she started having rapid heart rate like it was pounding out of her chest. It woke her up in the middle of the night around 2-3 AM so it was this morning around 2-3 AM. The patient can still feel like her heart is pounding out of her chest, but it is improved a little bit since it began. It is a little better now but is still persistent. No treatment was given for the adverse events. The patient was not sure if that is something that has been reported before. She did not know what to do but she wanted to try to find out if it was because of the vaccine.

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient did not receive any treatment from events. The outcome of events was recovered in Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

                                                Within 15 minutes my vision began to blur, I became shaky and disoriented. My heart rate increased and it felt as though my blood pressure decreased rapidly. After 30 minutes my symptoms had worsened and I was so disoriented I was not able to seek medical attention while being observed. I exited the building and once I got into my car my face (specifically under my eyes and on my cheeks) began swelling and a red burning rash appeared. By the time I got home (10 more minutes) I needed Benadryl immediately, I was not able to complete my sentences and all other symptoms had become more intense. I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours for the next few days due to the symptoms consistently rebounding. I had one episode of throat tightness but it passed without use of my epipen. I checked my pulse and blood pressure frequently with the lowest reading being 93/60. Lethargy, shakiness, confusion, high heart rate all are still present after 5 days. The rash went away after 48 hours.

                                                At 7:00am the morning after receiving my second dose of the vaccine, I arose from bed and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

Blood pressure remains high throughout the day and was first noticed on 03/20/2021. I first took my blood pressure after noticing a mild headache that was not alleviated with hydration or OTC pain medication. Headaches have returned intermittently since 03/20/2021 but now only lasts 1-2 hours. Tinnitus was noticed several weeks ago (specific date is unknown) and is a mild and quiet but constant high frequency ringing. Unsure if any of these are related but I have never had tinnitus and my blood pressure is not this high nor do I have headaches often or back-to-back.

                                                I had the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 4/6 and felt dizzy 30 minutes later. The dizziness continued for the next 84 hours. On 4/9 (three days after vaccination), I fainted on my  driveway as I was heading home around noon time. I felt dizzy the whole afternoon but were trying to help out the groceries from the car. I fell down on the concrete driveway with two bags of groceries on my hand. I did not blackout, but were not able to get up for 10 seconds due to the dizziness. I eventually recovered from the dizziness 84 hours after the first dose of vaccine. I injured my knee as I fell, but the wound were treated at home immediately.  As for the sore arm, I could not hold any items heavier than 1 lb. The arm soreness went away after 48 hours with ice pack applied on upper arm(injection area).

She then presented to her urgent care clinic around 3pm and was transferred to the Hospital ED. She was found to be in sinus tachycardia to HR 140s-150s. Work-up as described below was largely unrevealing. Plan for TTE on this hospital admission. Overall believe that severe anxiety is a the driving factor behind her sinus tachycardia, and that the SARS-CoV2 vaccination was just coincidental in time course.
