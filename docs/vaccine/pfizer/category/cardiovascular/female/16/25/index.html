                                                Patient in clinic for chief complaint of possible side effect of the covid vaccine which she received yesterday.  She states that she woke up at 0200 with chest tightness, achyness and headache.  She rates the discomfort 7/10 last night and improved now to 5/10.  She denies any worsening with any type of exertion and states that she can do simple things like take a shower, walk across the room, down the street or even stairs without any worsening.  She denies any SOB or chest pain--just feels tight.  Doesn&#39;t feel like she can&#39;t get a full breath or get the air out of her lungs either.  She received her first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday (4:23pm) and had no difficulty with the injection itself and then 9.5 hours later woke up from sleep with this chest tightness as well as achyness and headache.    She states that she had the exact same symptoms when she had positive covid test back in August of this year with the addition of fatigue which lasted for 5 days.  At that time it was not felt necessary to do any further testing nor treat with steroids according to cardiology.  She does have history of LV non-compaction cardiomyopathy and her last visit with cardiology was about 2 years ago and she had a normal EKG and echo only showed &#34;mild LV non compaction at the apex&#34; at that time. He did not need to see her again until she is 18 unless she has problems.  She states that she generally does very well and other than this tightness she does not have any other significant symptoms.

My daughter dealt with the other symptoms but her asthma became less treatable over the two days since the second shot. I finally administered the nebulizer and inhaled steroid today after all other treatments failed to relieve her symptoms. She is doing better but I will follow up with the pediatrician.

                                                Patient presented for her first COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately a minute after vaccine was given, she was noted to be seated upright in the passenger seat of her car, with head bent forward and eyes open. She was unresponsive, stiff posture, and was placed into a reclined position. She then had some posturing with head turned to the left, no eye deviation or nystagmus, no tonic-clonic movement. Radial pulse was thready, bradycardia was noted, with normal respirations. She was noted to become diaphoretic and pale/ashen color noted to the face and arms. She became responsive within a few minutes, however initially was not able to answer questions clearly. She had no loss of bowel or bladder function. EMS assisted with evaluation.  Initial blood pressure 78/31, HR 54, SpO2 100%.  EMS then transferred her to the stretcher and she was transitioned from her car to the ambulance. She continued to improve spontaneously with BP 94/61 then 103/60 and HR 86 then 74. SpO2 remained stable at 100%.  Skin color improved. She had normal responses to questions, no complaints of headache, dizziness, chest tightness, shortness of breath, numbness or tingling. She had some shaking/voluntary movement of the limbs and body noted, but she could control and stop this voluntarily, no myoclonic or tonic-clonic jerking noted.  After syncopal event occurred, mom reported that the patient has a history of syncope routinely with blood draws and vaccines in the past, however this episode was slightly more prolonged and seizure-like activity was different. She has had some jerking movement previously with syncope which lasts 20-30 seconds, different from today&#39;s response. No known history of seizure disorder.

                                                Asthma Attack started at 1 pm while seated and attending virtual class. She was under no distress and was not in any way exerting herself. She described the attack as a feeling of someone sitting on her chest and began to hyperventilate. The color drained from her face and her hands felt numb. Her asthma attacks are generally exercise-induced, so this was highly unusual.  She took a dose of albuterol ( 2 puffs with a spacer) and followed her asthma action plan. She laid down and slowed her breathing. 20 minutes later her facial color returned to normal. Two hours later her hands returned to normal. She was disoriented for about 5 hours.

The patient&#39;s mother initially supported the patient and I was called to assist the patient to the floor. The patient was very pale in appearance as she was assisted gently to the floor, avoiding any injury.  EMS was called shortly after the event around 1810. The patient remained conscious however was a bit disoriented initially while lying on the floor.  The patient recovered quickly, however remained nauseous and complained of feeling hot. Upon questioning the patient, she had not eaten since lunch at school at 1300. The patient was given a cold water and a sprite, of which she had a couple of drinks out of each. The patient was relocated back into a chair at 1815 as she was feeling much better. EMS arrived at 1821. EMS performed a general assessment and a blood pressure check resulting in 130/80. The patient&#39;s mother dismissed any further treatment from EMS.  EMS exited the building at 1827.  The patient and mother waited in the store for a while longer.  Both patient and mother exited on their own, denying escort from associates at 1840.

Mom was in the room as well, we gave her water and sat with her for about 10 minutes and she seemed weak but okay. They remained in the waiting area for another 15 minutes, she was feeling better and mom was comfortable to take her home as Mom is a Doctor.

                                                Patient stated in evaluation form that she had passed out once before after giving blood for labwork. She and her mother decided to continue with the vaccination as it had never occurred before after getting a vaccine.  A few minutes after the vaccine the patient lost consciousness.  Mom stated that her face tensed up right before hand.  The patient remained in her chair for the duration of the event.  She regained consciousness about 30 to 60 seconds later, and within a few minutes she was conscious but still very shaky, pale, and hot.  She was able to sip some water and we put a cool, wet  paper towel on the back of her neck.  The patient and her mother remained seated and under observation for an additional 15 to 20 minutes with no further issues, at which point they left the store.  I followed up with the patients mother the next day and she said her daughter was exhausted last night, but this morning she woke up feeling well and went to school like normal.

Patient placed on ECMO and imaging revealed bilateral large pulmonary embolism as likely etiology of arrest. Risk factors included oral contraceptive use.  Labs have since confirmed absence of Factor V leiden or prothrombin gene mutation. Patient declared dead by neurologic criteria 3/30/21.

                                                Patient was given a Pfizer covid vaccine and then immediately passed out.  She was completely unresponsive and given 1 dose of epi and she responded to the epi.  Her dad was with her and said that she has anxiety issues and this is probably the reason she passed out.  EMS was called  and it was decided between EMS and Dad that there was no reason to transport her to the hopital as she was doing fine after being checked out by EMS;  Dad signed a waiver with EMS declining transport to the hospital.

In the meantime, we had call 911 and when they evaluated her, they felt it was somewhat of a panic attack since she did have anxiety before getting the vaccine.

She did not hit her head because I was able to help her on her way down - it was a ver small room with 3 people in it. The pharmacist was there and he said it was a seizure, she just jerked her chin up, sharply 3 or 4 times. She laid on the ground for about five minutes, then sat on the ground, then sat in a chair for a total of about 20 minutes. She felt dizzy and nauseated for about 15 minutes after. She drank a juice and felt better so we drove home, no other symptoms since.

                                                After RN administered vaccine she spoke to my daughter for some time afterwards 5-6 minutes and my daughter was fine answering her questions and just visiting with her. She directed us to the table to schedule her second vaccine which was directly in front of us. We went to this table and spoke with two other ladies choosing a date and time and she was also fine talking with them and answering questions of eat time offered and then suddenly she went straight back with warning passed completely out and struck the back of her head on the concrete floor. EMS and RN?s who were there went to her aid immediately and she was unconscious for a little over a minute. They initially couldn?t get her to respond and finally she came to and had no idea what happened and no recollection of falling. She had blurred vision and bleeding a bit from the back of her head and they wanted her to have CT of her head after hitting it that hard. They took her by ambulance to hospital and they assessed her and ordered a CT. The CT thankfully came back clear and she has follow up appointment with concussion doctor first thing in the morning. On discharge she was describing her pain from hitting head a 7/10 It was very scary and everyone around us was visibly upset as well. She has never fainted or had a reaction to any other shot, vaccine or needle before today so that was a very unusual reaction.

                                                After getting the 2nd dose of Pfizer, two days later, my daughter developed chest pain. She gets the chest pain every day and it today&#39;s date is 4/27/2021. She went to urgent care on April 18, 2021. However, she kept having chest pain and Saturday, April 24th the chest pain was intense. Patient states she has daily chest pain. Chest pain tends to be intermittent but she has it several times throughout the day. Sometimes the chest pain can be intense. (patient has a history of Kawasaki Disease, she received IVIG as a toddler and was on aspirin for a few weeks after the treatment. We were concerned if the chest pain was related to her heart).  Currently, still monitoring her chest pains daily.

                                                Stroke; severe allergic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient&#39;s father) from the Pfizer-sponsored program. A 16-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the Right Arm (also reported as: right shoulder) on 23Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) at 16-years-old as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included heart valve operation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Mechanical heart valves).  Concomitant medications included an unspecified medication, taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, which was reported as: &#34;Yes she is taking other medication.&#34; On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced stroke and severe allergic reaction (medically significant). The clinical course was reported as follows: On behalf of his 16-year-old daughter, the patient&#39;s father reported that she had the first dose administer in the right shoulder on 23Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, the patient had a stroke.  The patient&#39;s father stated, &#34;our lives have changed, completely.&#34; The patient&#39;s father reported that his daughter was receiving medical care ever since then; and was also being treated by a physician.  The patient&#39;s father was asking about compensation from Pfizer regarding his daughter&#39;s severe adverse event (AE) that occurred after the first dose of vaccine. The patient&#39;s father reported that the case had been submitted by the (Name) healthcare team &#34;to the FDA and to Pfizer, and I haven&#39;t heard back from either.&#34; The patient&#39;s father mentioned in passing, that he &#34;could call (Name) and have this all over the news&#34; but that he &#34;wants to be responsible&#34; and doesn&#39;t want to do that.  The patient&#39;s father stated the concern, &#34;Well my concern I am not sure that medical profession is what I really need to do, my concern is that my daughter took the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 23Mar2021 in (Name) in vaccination location. On 29Mar2021, 6 days later, she had a stroke, and that she is receiving a medical care ever since then , now  my question is like I said probably for  maybe for correlated relation type of person define as well as  for it  there is a compensation for adverse reaction to COVID vaccination being that this was only thing that was introduce in her system as far as doing that time the vaccination shot.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: &#34;that&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34; on an unknown date; also reported: &#34;Yes that&#39;s been ongoing as far as giving blood. That&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34;. Therapeutic measures were not taken and was reported as &#34;no she isn&#39;t taking anything for it.&#34; The clinical outcome of the events, stroke and severe allergic reaction, was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021411875 Pfizer

Symptoms started pretty much right after getting the shot but the dizziness and tightness in chest stopped after I took a nap about an hour after the shot. As of the submission of the form I am still feeling soreness in my arm but it?s lessened a bit and I still feel nauseous and am having trouble breathing properly.

Medic noted that the client was CAOx4,  her skin was pale, warm and slightly moist, pupils were equal, round, reactive to light and accommodating (PEARRL), respiration rate (RR) was 20. The client&#39;s sister stated the client had a history of anxiety and that &#34;she gets this way whenever she gets a shot&#34;. Medic walked patient to the zero gravity chair. The client was given water to sip on. At 1213 baseline vitals were taken with client sitting: Blood pressure (BP): 110/82, heartrate (HR): 98, RR: 20, PEARRL. Medic  reports she coached the client on her breathing  to help alleviate her complaint of feeling lightheaded, mild nausea and anxiety. Client reported she felt anxious prior to her vaccination and that her last oral intake was 15 minutes prior to vaccine. Client denied headache, blurry vision and chest pain. At 1220 a second set of vitals were taken while standing: BP 108/80, HR 86, RR 16, CAOx4. Client stated her symptoms were diminishing. Client&#39;s RR slowed down to normal rate and rhythm, vital signs were trending to normal and client was negative for orthostatic pressures. Client was advised to stay for additional 30 minute observation. Client&#39;s symptoms resolved completely and she was able to ambulate away from observation site without assistance and with a steady gait.

                                                16 yo female came into our injection site today 05/05/21 to receive her first pfizer vaccine. She was accompanied by her father. Pt received vaccine IM to her left deltoid. Pt completed vaccine at 2:55pm at which she sat down for her 15 minute observation period. As soon as she sat down she called over the staff that administered the vaccine. She explained to her that she felt nausea and was breathing heavily. I then walked over to them and the attendee was very pale and breathing heavily. By that time I had RN getting attendees history from her father, She has no history of allergic reactions, not taking any medications and no current illness. She is &#34;slightly asthmatic&#34; but is not taking any rx.  RN was helping me by putting cold pack behind attendees neck. Pt then proceeded to explain that she felt nauseas and starting dry heaving. RN then brought over trash can and attendee started to vomit. I then started to proceed and take her vitals. first set of vitals were taken at 2:58pm BP: 90/60 HR: 132 RR: 24 O2: 100%. Attendee at this point was diaphoretic, pale, breathing heavily and vomiting. We continued to monitor attendee in which she started to feel better by 3:08 pm. She was no longer pale, diaphoretic or vomitting and was breathing normally. We provided attendee with water and continued to monitor her. Now that pt was calm, I was able to ask her some questions. She stated that she had a smoothie and an avocado toast about an hour prior to vaccine. She explained to me that she does have a phobia to needles and was feeling very anxious prior to appointment. I then repeated her vitals at 3:16pm BP: 98/60 HR:89 RR: 20 O2: 99%.  I had attendee stand up off chair and walk at 3:22pm. She felt fine and did not feel dizzy at all. No signs of distress noted. She was then discharged and walked out with her dad at 3:25pm.

As she was walking to the teacher&#39;s desk, she lost consciousness and fainted, hitting her head on a desk, scraping her neck on a desk, and suffering several other minor injuries from the fall.  She was immediately seen by school nurse and released to my care for the rest of the day. She rested at home and then was seen in at Walk-In Clinic to be evaluated for a concussion.  On Day 2 after receiving the vaccine, the patient reported a sore throat, but no other symptoms.  She was seen on the third day post-vaccine by our pediatrician&#39;s office for possible strep.  She tested negative for strep and a concussion from her fainting episode was confirmed due to the lingering headache.

                                                My 16-year-old daughter, very healthy without any health conditions, got her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday evening, April 10th, at around 5pm. On Wednesday, she started complaining of shortness of breath, chest pains, which she described as a feeling of someone stubbing her heart. By Thursday, she began blacking out repeatedly throughout the day, each blackout lasting about a minute. These progressed and whenever she blacked out, she would not remember what happened. At first, she and I brushed it off as maybe lack of calcium since she rarely drinks milk. But as they intensified, I began to become more concerned. I told her I cannot leave her by herself in the house as I prepared to go pick up her young siblings from school then schedule an appointment with her doctor. On our way back home, she blacked out again, however, it was for more than a minute. Straight away, I drove to the  ER close by. The doctor came back to inform me that her heartbeat was irregular and concerning based on her age. In that same moment, she began complaining of excessive pain like someone punching her heart out, and then she passed out again. Still with my two other children, the whole ordeal began to frighten them and illicit some heavy tears.  Being that this ER was general admission, the doctors insisted they call in the paramedics to transport her to another ER for children. However, after being transported to the other ER, her condition began to intensify rather quickly and the pediatric doctor at the second ER informed us we would have to be transferred to Childrens intensive care unit where the cardiologists could check her heart, find the ultimate cause, and monitor her closely. In that moment, as a mother, I was speechless and extremely terrified. Seeing my daughter being transferred from ER to ER, made it even tougher on me so much that I could no longer hold myself together. Here she was in terrible pain and being moved around with no clear diagnosis and treatment.  From there on, we spent a couple days in the Cardiac ICU waiting and praying with friends for answers and the best treatment she could get to ease the pain. By about the third day of being in the ICU, the cardiologists informed me, she had Acute Myocarditis. This was so shocking in a sense that both sides of the family have no history of heart issues. Secondly, she is a very healthy child.

                                                16yoF was accompanied with an adult who was present for the vaccination. The COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech 0.3mL administered IM in right deltoid while patient was sitting. Patient remained sitting for 10 minutes after administered dose. Patient reported feeling well after the injection. Patient stood up while we continued to talk, after 2 more minutes passed out while standing. Suddenly, patient begain to go limp and her eyes crossed and rolled back. Patient fell backwards into the privacy curtain and into aisle 13 of the store. Patient&#39;s head bounced off the floor. Immunizer  knelt next to patient. Patient was unresponsive until immunizer placed cold hand on back of neck and front of chest to check if she was breathing, immunizer calmly  guided patient to breath, slow deep breaths into the belly and patient&#39;s eyes fluttered open. She said her head hurt really bad. Immunizer offered to the accompanying adult to call EMS because patient should be evaluated after hitting her head so hard. The accompanying adult denyed EMS, then stating that patient had previously fainted while walking and said that she would be fine. Immunizer advised patient to remain laying down while immunizer got some ice. Ice was then placed on the back of the head. Patient slowly stood up after laying for 10 minutes and was walked over to a sitting area to put feet up and continue with ice for another 5 minutes before the accomanying adult wanted to leave.

                                                The patient felt tired and describes her eyes going dark, then passed out a few minutes after vaccination.  She was vaccinated and then left the immunization room to sit down for a 15 minute waiting period.  When she went to sit down, she collapsed on the floor.  Her mother assisted her into a chair.  She continued to be incoherent and have her eyes rolling back into her head for a few minutes.  We used a cool cloth on her forehead and the back of her neck.  The parents requested that we call 911.  EMS arrived shortly and evaluated her.  Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse ox, blood sugar and chest sounds were all within normal range.  The patient stated that her arm felt heavy and &#34;funny&#34;.  She then stated that her tongue felt funny.  EMS evaluated her tongue and said it looked normal.  To err on the side of caution, she was taken to the hospital to determine whether or not she was having a delayed onset anaphylactic reaction.  This patient has no history of seizures.

Her course was complicated by respiratory failure (requiring ICU admission for CPAP), pancytopenia, diarrhea with buttock skin breakdown requiring rectal tube for wound and stool management, and extensive workup which was unrevealing for an infectious cause.  She clinically improved with respect to pancytopenia with discontinuation of felbamate, and completed a treatment course with Zosyn for suspected buttock SSTI.

She remained seated in the room and closed her eyes a couple times but never appeared to lose consciousness.  Her dad joined us in the room and confirmed she was really nervous before the vaccine.  We kept her seated for several minutes and then she said she felt sick and vomited.  After that she started to regain her color and was able to move to the waiting room.  She sat there for about 5 more minutes and then felt well enough to leave with her dad.

A 16-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 25Apr2021 (Lot Number: EWO171) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, Pyle disease, food allergies, short stature, seasonal allergies, peanuts allergies and nuts allergies. It was unknown if the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. On 26Apr2021, the patient had elevated temperatures to 104 [unspecified unit], 4-5 days post vaccination (pending clarification) with associated chills and headaches. Thrombocytopenia noted. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was provided for the adverse events. The patient was tested post vaccination with a nasal swab test on 28Apr2021 and the result of negative. The reporter did not consider the events was serious. The outcome of the event was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event thrombocytopenia was observed only 1 day after vaccination.  It is unlikely that thrombocytopenia is related to BNT162B2.  It&#39;s more likely intercurrent medical condition. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Mother and I moved patient to a laying down position where she immediately woke up and knew where she was and what just happened. Declined any other symptoms. Mom said she passes out often after vaccinations. Patient was conscious carrying on a conversation like normal immediately after coming to. Over the next 30 minutes I tried to get patient to a sitting position to take her blood pressure but every time we tried she needed to lay back down because she felt like she was going to pass out. After trying this twice and being unsuccessful I had EMS called to check on patient to make sure nothing more serious going on. EMS came and took a couple blood pressures and pulses which were normal. Patient was starting to feel better. Walked out with EMS and planned on going home.

Patient was waiting the period of time afterwards.  Mother then stated she was having a reaction.  Mother stated she is a nurse and said she believed the patient was having a seizure.  Mother later was not sure if patient had fainted also since she was nervous about receiving the shot in the first place.  After paramedics arrived, they took her glucose and was 77.  Paramedics let mom then take patient home to get food.

She was tested for active COVID-29 infection via nasal swab PCR and tested positive. Upon presentation labs were drawn and her platelet count was found to be 8 on 5/15. Repeat labs were drawn that day to confirm low platelet count and confirmed diagnosis and thrombocytopenia secondary to an immune reaction to the vaccine was suspected. She was admitted and was started on tranexamic acid, medroxyprogesterone, dexamethasone and IV immunoglobulin (Ig) to help treat low platelet count and vaginal bleeding. As of writing, she is still admitted and her most recent platelet count on 5/17 was 16.

                                                Right after receiving Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, patient began to feel queasy.  I asked her whether she had eaten recently and she said she hadn?t.  Her eyes rolled back and up then her head fell backward.  I supported her head and her dad was checking her for awareness.  I gave her a bottle of water and she drank some of it.  She indicated that her vision was still not accurate.  Her dad brought her a candy bar and she ate the majority of it and drank the majority of the contents of the water bottle.   We gave her a few more minutes to feel comfortable then I asked whether she was ready to stand up.  She was not.  We gave her a bag of chips and she ate some and finished the water bottle.  After a few more minutes, she stood up and was able to walk without assistance.     Her father indicated that she had an incident like this before, but patient did not remember the previous incident.

                                                is a 16-year-old female patient admitted with tachycardia.  Starting 1-1/2 weeks ago, mom notes that she has had episodes where she feels her heart racing.  It began 1-1/2 weeks ago with her crying and her watch that her heart rate was 208.  They went to the ED, where she was given some fluids and her heart rate improved so she was sent home.  She had had prior episodes of mild tachycardia up to the 140s in the past but which has always improved with fluids.  Mom states that she used to have a lot of trouble maintaining her hydration and would not drink a lot of water.  Since the last 1-1/2 weeks, she has been having these episodes 1-2 times a day that last about 1 to 2 minutes with a max of 5 minutes.  When it comes on, she feels dizzy and lightheaded, and after the episode she feels a big rush of blood to her head.  She also has some associated shortness of breath.  She denies having any episodes of chest pain at all.  She has never passed out, she has never felt like she was going to pass out, she has never felt like she was out of balance.  She denies any nausea or vomiting during episodes.  She denies any headaches during the episodes.  She does have history of migraines, but has not had one in the last couple weeks.  Her prior resting heart rate was in the 80s per her watch, and lately it has been in the 110s to 120s while awake in 80s while asleep.  Along with the episodes, she also feels some pulsating sensation in her abdomen.  She does not have any abdominal pain.  Today, her heart rate was again in the 200s, but it was worse than before because it lasted about 30 minutes total.  Lately they have been using an app that continuously monitors her heart rate.  Since these episodes started, she has cut down on her caffeine intake and she has increased her water intake.  Does not feel that this helped. She has never had syncope in the past and has never had seizures in the past.  Patient was started on carvedilol which has helped control heart rate and was encouraged to drink fluids. Per primary care team, her current episode of tachycardia was not due to the vaccine.

A 16-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0167, expiry date: Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left deltoid, on 30Apr2021 15:30, as 1st dose, single, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a pharmacy/drug store. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On 30Apr2021 15:30, the patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and was very anxious. She wanted her mom to be present. On the same day, 30Apr2021 15:35, five minutes later, the patient was shaking, and she fainted. The reporter did not know if she was having a convulsion or a seizure. A few minutes later, the patient was sitting and becoming more alert. The patient was given water and one dose of Benadryl. The patient&#39;s vital signs were checked (unknown result). The reporter talked to the patient&#39;s mother and contacted the patient&#39;s pediatrician. The events resulted to emergency room and physician&#39;s office visits. Later in the evening, the reporter followed up with the mother and she confirmed that the patient was doing well and better. The mother asked the reporter if the patient should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of the events fainted, shaking,  &#34;didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure&#34; and &#34;was very anxious&#34; was recovering. The reporter assessed the events fainted, shaking,  &#34;didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure&#34; as serious (medically significant). The reporter considered that BNT162B2 has a causal effect to the adverse events.  Follow-up (18May2021: New information received from a contactable pharmacist includes: reporter information, lab data, suspect drug details (vaccination site and vaccination time), event details (onset time provided, outcome updated to recovering, causality and seriousness assessment provided).  Follow up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, and on a reportedly closed temporal association, the company assessed that a reasonable possibility could not be excluded that the reported events (fainted;  didn&#39;t know if it was a convulsion or a seizure) were related to the suspect product BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Vaccine administered at outside facility. Patient is a 16 yo girl, admitted on 4/19 with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (4/19) after presenting with progressive new onset chest pain. She was in usual state of health up until 2 days ago when she started developing body aches, and chest pain. Patient received her 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine last week (4/15). No known history of COVID infection. Parents brought her to the ED yesterday after she complained of dizziness, SOB, chest pain, and had a near syncopal event. EKG showed non-specific ST abnormalities with labs showing elevated troponin, mildly elevated CRP, normal CXR, negative COVID PCR. Denies fever, GI symptoms, GU symptoms, headache, rash. Once transferred to our PICU, she was worked up for myocarditis vs MIS-C. Troponin has been trended q6 and is trending up (now 11). Of note, there have been no fevers. Patient is a 16 yo girl, s/p admission (4/19-4/23/21) with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (4/19), has now been readmitted on 5/10 with myocarditis after presenting with headache and neck pain for 2 days. Following discharge from the PICU on 4/23, patient states that symptoms have lingered (low grade fevers, feeling tired, on and off chest pain). After developing a progressive headache and neck pain, she came back to the ER for re-evaluation. Upon readmission, her troponin was elevated (2.06 on 5/10). Her CBC and CMP were reassuring. Blood culture collected on 5/11 and urine culture collected on 5/10. ID consulted for workup.

                                                Patient was visibly nervous/anxious about the vaccination. Patient had reported syncope from a previous vaccination on their consent/screening form. Vaccine was administered as prescribed and patient initially appeared fine but lost consciousness approximately 15 to 20 seconds after. The patient&#39;s mother, who was present as her legal guardian, helped me cushion the the patient to ensure she did not fall and injure herself. Patient regained consciousness in 10 to 15 seconds but then passed out again. I was then able to elevate the patient&#39;s legs and she regained consciousness. Provided patient with chilled bottled water and allowed her to rest in the vaccination booth for 15 minutes. I stayed with the patient during that time and observed her. Afterwards she said she was feeling better and the color in her face was returning. She felt comfortable standing up and moved to a different seat in front of the pharmacy where she waited another 15 minutes. I observed her from the bench during that time.  When the patient and her mother felt comfortable they left the pharmacy together.

Her body was leaned back on the bench, with head tilted back a bit. When I came out, patient appeared very pale. I immediately ran back into the pharmacy, instructed a fellow employee to reach out for assistance from front end management, and I called 911. While on the phone with 911, I walked out to check on the patient. At that point, she appeared to be coherent and said she was okay, and doesn&#39;t need any medical help. At that time, her brother explained that a reaction like this had occurred in the past when she got other vaccinations/injections so they were familiar with the symptoms. We continued to monitor patient for further reactions. After about 30 minutes, patient appeared to have no further reactions and left.

She immediately turned  around to sit down again.  She then  proceeded to start falling to her right and passed out.  I was able to catch her and then she started  shaking as if having a seizure.  This lasted about 5 seconds .  She stopped  and then it happened again  for about 5 seconds.  When she came to, she tried to walk away again and had to return to sitting.  Then she vomited twice.  Upon checking her blood pressure after about 30 minutes, it was 97/66.  She sat for a total of about an hour before feeling  good enough to leave.  She was nauseous for the remainder of the day and the next day as well.

                                                Shortly after receiving vaccine (about 5 minutes), pt complained about difficulty breathing. I went to check on her and she appeared pale and seemed very drowsy and unresponsive to questions. She continued to complain about dizziness and nausea. Her parents grabbed some water for her and still there was no improvement. I called 911 to report the symptoms and was advised to administer EpiPen. When asked if her breathing improved, she nodded yes, but she did not appear to have improved. She continued to be unresponsive to questions and appeared extremely drowsy. Within 15 minutes, the ambulance arrived.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine. Patient left to sit in out waiting room after vaccine. Patient&#39;s mother informed in a few minutes that the patient was not feeling well. She stated that the patient felt hot. I grabbed an ice pack on my way out to her. I put the ice pack behind her neck. Patient passed out within a minute of me getting to the patient. She came back to quickly and stated that she was having a hard time seeing and hearing. She then again passes out. At this point I made the decision to call 911. I delegated to my tech to call 911.  She called 911.  I asked my other tech to come help me thinking the patient my have needed to be lower to the ground. The patient again regained consciousness.  At this point I asked tech to call our Store Director and inform them. I also asked that she get me a water for the patient. The patient was feeling better and drank some water. She then again passes out. This time we were struggling to get her to regain consciousness. I used sternal rubs to help the patient regain consciousness. I was having a hard time finding her pulse. This lasted for a minute or two and then she stared responding. Right then EMS arrived and took over. I gave them the information I had and they took her vitals. EMS decided that she was stable and could go home to be monitored by mom. I did call the Mother the next morning to check on the patient. The patient did well last night and was feeling good this morning.

                                                passed out; BP was 70/44; could not sit or stand; EKG-Potential abnormal Twave; Calcium was low; This is a spontaneous report received from two contactable consumers reporting for her daughter. A 16-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), vaccinated at the age of 16 years old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Deltoid Left on 05May2021 15:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8735; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient received the first dose on unknown date. Her daughter had no reaction from the first one that was three weeks prior.  The patient medical history included Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Concomitant medications included lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE) taken for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, start and stop date were not reported. Last Wednesday, at 3 pm, caller&#39;s daughter received the second vaccine.  Her daughter had no ill effects.  Her daughter got up the next morning, 18 hours after administration, and passed out. Caller states that they called the squad and her daughter&#39;s BP was 70/44.  They pushed an IV, transported her daughter, and they were in the ER for 10 hours. The local hospital gave her daughter 2 1/2 bags of fluid and transported her daughter to Hospital. Caller adds that there were 4 liters of fluid given, and her daughter could not sit or stand without her blood pressure dropping for about 8 hours after the incident. There were 2 transports and 2 ER&#39;s. Caller asks why were they not told that this is a symptom.  She was grateful that she could catch her daughter before she hit her head, but what about parents who leave their kids alone. Last Wednesday, caller&#39;s daughter received the vaccine 05May2021 at 3 pm and passed out 06May2021 in the morning.  It was the only time she passed out and caller states she saw her daughter&#39;s head drop and then was trying and caught her.  She was trying to talk to her and her eyes were in the back of her head, and was trying to arouse her.  She was out for over a minute.  She went to Emergency Room in. They were there for 6 hours.  Then, when she could not sit up and her blood pressure was dropping, they recommended Hospital.  She was there, this all took place, on Thursday from 9 am or around 8:50 am when she passed out and then they were discharged after 9 pm.  It was a 12 hour situation where they were transported and she spent 12 hours in 2 emergency rooms. The only one she had at time was vyvanse but she did not take this before passing out.  The last time that she took this would have been nine hours before administration of the vaccine on 05May2021. She did not take it on 06May2021 when the incident happened.  She was just getting up.  She had only been on this for about a week.  It is a stimulant drug but it is out of the system in the evening so people can sleep.  She asked each doctors if this had any role in it and they said no.  They told her to take it again which they have not started back yet.  She has no other medical conditions. Investigations: caller does not provide dates or specific test results.  The first ER did bloodwork, urine, chest x-ray. They wanted a CAT scan of her head but caller declined because she thought it was unnecessary. They did an EKG at first in the ER.  Nothing was abnormal.  She did have some things out of range in bloodwork which is not surprising because she was taking in fluids. Her calcium was low.  Nothing was way out of range, nothing was abnormal. The second ER did a follow up EKG but no other tests or bloodwork.  According to three physicians, the EKG was fine.  A cardiologist reviewed the 2nd EKG and she got a phone call that they wanted her to follow up because of potential abnormal T waves which could have been a result of that much fluid intake and electrolytes being out of sync after that much fluid.  They are following up on this. Her father has as vasovagal response hat he has experienced 4-5 times in his lifetime. He has never passed out following a vaccine. Caller had no idea that was even a response to vaccine. He has passed out after giving blood, with severe pain, coming out of anesthetic, and with severe stress. He has never had an extended period of time where his blood pressure was low. She, they could not get, her blood pressure up with fluid after fluid which is why she was transported to the second ER because they thought they did not know what was going on there. Caller states does she think that there may be some relationship and her daughter has this tendency to vasovagal - yes.  Was it brought on by the vaccine?  Yes.  She has never fainted in her life.  Caller adds she can see how some many say this may not be related to the vaccine but 18 hours after administration, they can not get her blood pressure up and were in the ER for 12 hours. Treatment included all the fluid, and 2 capsules of acetaminophen.  No other treatment. Outcome of events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available.

I took my blood pressure and the reading was 120/71 with a pulse of 54 which is really low. I went to the Dr. to be evaluated. Dr. felt it was a vasovagal response. I will continue to monitor myself and if it continues, I will see a cardiologist.

                                                Mother reported daughter fell in bathroom in the middle of the night- said she couldn&#39;t see  then sight came back.  Then again Mother checked on daughter later on and daughter was unresponsive when mom was tapping her in the face-she was just looking at her mom but not seeing or hearing her -like a black out-- couldnt be woken up easily- and when she did wake she couldn&#39;t see.  But since those 2 episodes daughter&#39;s sight is back but she feels nauseous and has an upset stomach.

She fell out of her chair, her eyes fluttered and rolled in the back of her head, her teeth were clocking and chattering and her body was shaking mildly. She lost consciousness for approximately 2 minutes. At 8:33 pm she felt a second seizure begin, her step father grabbed her before she could fall and again, her eyes fluttered and rolled in back of her head, her teeth were clicking and chattering and her whole body was shaking. The second episode lasted approximately 2 minutes as well, with her losing consciousness again. She was taken to the emergency room and stayed overnight for observation.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine the patient start to feel light headed, she saw stars, she vomited, she started to look pale and felt tightness in her chest. We called the EMTs and we advised the patient that syncope is something we have seen in children receiving the vaccine and the EMTs advised of the same thing. They took her vitals all normal and the patient began to see the symptoms disappear. The patient once better and cleared by EMTs went home per their advise.

She couldn?t see and it seemed like it was a Vaso Vagal response which resolved quickly. At 5am the woke up with a fever of 102 and extreme left arm pain. The fever was controlled with Tylenol. Two days after the vaccine she woke up complaining of chest pain and a knot under her left arm. It felt like something was pressing on her chest. We went to the ER and all tests were negative. The feeling lasted until the end of the day. Three days after the shot the next morning she got a headache  for half of the day and resolved with Tylenol. The next day all symptoms were gone.

                                                atient was in for 2nd covid-19 (Pfizer lot was EW0167, exp 8/31/2021):  It was her and her brother receiving the vaccine. Brother went first and was fine. She was second. After receiving the vaccine (~30-60sec) she appeared to lose conciseness (not sure if complete or partial) she said she didn&#39;t remember all of it, but it was more like a dream. During that she had some twitches/spams (involving circular motions with her arms and leg, leg extended and then retracted, but her head rolled back). Upon coming out/waking she appeared sensitive to light and was nauseous. Left her in the room with her mom to get an ice pack, water, paper towel. Total episode lasted less than a minute, but took about 10-15 minutes (estimate, unsure of full time spent) before she felt good enough to use a wheelchair and get in her mom&#39;s car to drive home.

                                                Fever and chills on the 8th and  9th; Over the last couple of weeks, several times that I&#39;ve gone to doctor. On May 18th, she had what was considered to be  a pre-syncope event (almost passed out). And she had a pretty large migraine headache as well - the headache lasted for days - for probably three days. 18th, went to dr and they took her vitals. They were under the impression she passed out from having the migraine (her blood pressure is low but normal, in general). Dr was called on Monday 24th - doctor wanted tests. She had another pre-syncope event on May 1st in school and then had  a fever the rest of the week. (From 6/1/2021 - 6/6/2021 - fever and threw up and bad headache - fever until yesterday). I did take her pediatrician. Negative for COVID and Strep on 2nd . She had another migraine on Tuesday. Pediatrician said it could be a viral infection of some sort. Neurologist believes the migraines were exacerbated by the viral infection as well. This one has lingered and it&#39;s the first time she had a migraine within a week or two  weeks of each other. She was out of school was out 2 1/2 days last week and the week of the 18th she was out of school the 19th and got sick again the 20th and was out.

                                                sepsis; myocarditis; pneumonia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable HCP (nurse). A 16 years old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via intramuscular in arm right on 01May2021 10:00 AM (Lot Number: EW0175) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnancy at time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient had no known allergies (NKA). The patient&#39;s concomitant medication was reported as no prescribed medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Symptomatic COVID-19 (Non-PCR rapid NAA) from nasal swab on 19Dec2020 was negative. The patient admitted on 19May2021 with sepsis secondary to myocarditis and pneumonia, status post (s/p) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), after presenting with fever, myalgia, sore throat, hypotension, elevated troponin, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocytosis with left shift. Sore throat has been present for about a week (onset estimated on 12May2021) and fevers began on 17May2021 with a T max of 103. On 18May2021, she began developing shortness of breath and upon evaluation by the primary care physician (PCP) on 19May2021, she was admitted. During initial workup on 19May2021 upon admission, hospitalist was high concerned as she developed hypotension of 91/48 on 20May2021 at 08:35 am. Computerized tomography (CT) of chest on 20May2021 showed patchy consolidation of the posterior lower lobes bilaterally. Upon transfer to another place, further serologies were collected which showed leukocytosis with left shift, highly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated troponin, elevated Interleukin-6 (IL-6), elevated ferritin, negative covid antibodies (abs) test, negative respiratory viral panel  (RVP), and negative COVID PCR. Coronavirus NAA from nasal swab on 18May2021 was negative. Respiratory Viral Panel from nasal swab on 19May2021 was negative. COVID-19 (Standard NAA) from nasal swab on 19May2021 was negative. SARS CoV2 Antibodies from blood test on 20May2021 was negative. SARS COV2 IgM Antibodies from blood test on 20May2021 was positive. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, and hospitalization. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2grams/kg started on 20May2021 at 22:57. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the consistency with the known safety profile of the suspect product BNT162B2, there is a reasonable possibility that events sepsis, myocarditis, pneumonia were related to suspect drug based on the temporal relation between the vaccination and onset of events.

                                                Patient admitted with myocarditis s/p dose #2 of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  At the time of the report, she is still hospitalized. From EHR note: Patient was in her usual state of health when she received her second dose of the Pfizer mRNA Covid vaccine on 6/3.  She experienced mild myalgias in the day following the vaccine.  However, on 6/5 she developed new severe substernal chest pain, dizziness, and dyspnea.  Pain radiated to her throat.  Given severity of pain, she presented to the emergency department.  In the ED she was afebrile, tachycardic, and initially hypertensive.  Labs demonstrated WBC 10.9 (N 49, L 27), Hb 11.7, PLT 315.  ESR 25, CRP 7.61.  Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.08, consistent with mild cardiac inflammation.  SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were negative. An EKG was normal. However, an echo demonstrated low-normal LVEF (55%).  Otherwise, patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, new rashes, arthralgias. Patient was admitted to the cardiology service for further monitoring.  Following admission, she was started on ibuprofen.  She notes that her substernal chest pain has improved somewhat since admission.  Differential for patient&#39;s presentation includes infectious, post-infectious, and non-infectious causes of myocarditis. Although post-vaccination mild myocarditis seems likely, we agree with the infectious workup already undertaken, and recommend additional EBV and CMV PCR testing.

He is warm and well-perfused although is slightly tachycardic but appears anxious.  His reported inability to move her arms and legs does not seem consistent with a neurologic etiology of this complaint and more likely consistent with anxiety/conversion reaction in the setting of a vasovagal episode.  Will give zyrtec at mother and patient&#39;s request, PO challenge and reassess.

                                                While waiting during the 15 minute monitoring period patient (17 year old female) fainted in her chair. Mom noticed that patient&#39;s arms went rigid right before she passed out. Patient was still breathing and was laid on the ground to her side and 911 was called immediately. Mom was massaging her thighs and arms to increase blood flow and she regained consciousness within a few minutes. She was very pale and felt weak. She was given water and remained laying on the ground for another 10 minutes before EMS arrived. She explained she gets anxiety about any medical procedure, has had history of fainting after shots/blood draw/blood pressure reading. EMS took fingerstick reading and gave her oxygen to ensure she doesn&#39;t faint again from blood glucose fingerstick. Vitals came out to be normal. Mom explained this is very normal and she doesn&#39;t see the need to take her to the hospital. EMS offered to have patient with them in the ambulance for another 15-20 minutes before she&#39;s free to leave.

Mom reports a history of fainting so nurse decided to administer vaccine with client lying down. Vaccine was administered and client immediately stiffened arms and appeared to seize while her eyes rolled back. Nurse reported she turned the client onto her side and she &#34;came to within 20-30 seconds.&#34; She reported blurry vision but could read when asked to do so. She quickly became alert and oriented. Her mother reported that she had a previous episode one time in the past year with painful menses. Her vitals remained stable but each time she attempted to stand up, she reported feeling &#34;sick.&#34; She developed a headache within minutes of the vaccine and took 2 Tylenol while still there. Client left with parent to follow up at hospital.

Approximately 5 minutes while sitting in the waiting area, patient&#39;s father noticed his daughter was about to fall over but caught her without her falling to the floor.  The patient was conscious, has a pulse and was breathing the whole time.  Pharmacist on duty called 911 and within 10 minutes the paramedic arrived.  They checked her BP, heart rate and blood sugar.  Both her BP and blood sugar were within normal range, while her heart rate was out of range. The paramedics suggested to the parents that their daughter needs further monitoring. The parents agreed and left wit the Paramedics.

I asked her to go outside the immunization room and wait 15 minutes for observation.  Immediately upon leaving the room, she felt dizzy and made it to the chair to sit down, when she said she briefly blacked out. By that time, her father arrived, and gave her some orange juice to drink. She said she was starting to feel better, but that her stomach felt queasy. After15 minutes, the patient was feeling better and walked out with her father with no other reports of problems.

I threw up 5 times and my arms started to get numb. I had a fever when I got home and I couldn?t move because my body hurt so badly. Migraine and dizziness has been persistent ever since and is interfering with my daily life. Been treating with tylenol which helps a little but not completely. As soon as I stand up and move I feel like I?m going to pass out.

                                                about 5 minutes after administration, patient became unresponsive and was going in and out of consciousness. Her pupils became dilated and she would not respond to stimuli. Her respiratory status was unclear. No hives or rash could be observed. Patient became pale in the face. An allergic reaction could not be ruled out and the patient became less responsive so an EpiPen 0.3mg was administered in the left thigh. Patient was placed on her back on the ground. She became more alert and seemed to have normal breathing. EMS arrived and took vitals. Blood pressure was 138/77 with a heart rate of 88 bpm. Patient&#39;s father is taking her to her PCP for follow up this afternoon.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

                                                Recipient is a 17yo who presented for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. She reported some anxiety related to receiving dose #2, and had some nausea after dose #1. She was alone as a driver of her own POV.  Consent was obtained from the recipient and her custodial grandparent by phone, witnessed by doctor. She initially did well after the vaccine, but after approximately 5 minutes began to complain of feeling nauseated, lightheaded, and tingling extremities (hands and feet). She was noted to be hyperventilating, and was placed in a supine position but continued to feel some lightheadedness and difficulty breathing. Breath sounds were clear without wheezing noted, HR 70s with RRR. She was noted to have ongoing anxiety, nausea and symptoms progressed and although she remained normotensive to hypertensive (initial BP 128/74), she had repeated episodes of syncope.  She was transferred to the ambulance and further vitals and EKG were obtained. She had some confusion after episodes of syncope and some seizure-like activity with syncope, with very brief episodes of LOC, with noted tachycardia with HR up to the 140s during episodes of syncope.  BP ranged 129/86 to 140/84. IV access obtained and she was given NS and started on oxygen at 2 liters, but saturations remained in the 98-99% range. She was ultimately transferred to the local ER for further evaluation and management given ongoing symptoms, evaluated at hospital.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of receiving the shot, my daughter felt hotness running down the length of her vaccinated arm and into her hand. Started feeling hot and started to produce a small patch of hives on the outside of the throat and chest. Did vigorous windmill motions with vaccinated arm.  She had a feeling of slight unwellness that was followed by a rush of energy.  As we leave the store and start to drive home her hives are a little bit worse and she says she feels a little lightheaded and has some heart palpations. But is still reporting a rush of energy. By the time we get home 10 minutes later hives,  lightheadedness, and heart palpations have resolved.  She feels great the rest of the day. Next day slight redness around the injection site and arm a bit sore. The following day redness is gone but a slight rash is starting to show up around the neck. 5 days later, the rash becomes inflamed, sore, hot and itchy, hives are full upper-body flareups. She takes Allegra 24 for hives control. Rash comes and goes daily.  Acts more like hives. Allegra 24 controls hives mostly along with icing. After a few days, the effectiveness of the Allegra 24 is not as efficient with the neck rash. Switches to Zyrtec 24 which seems to provide better relief from both hives and rash around the neck. Sees Dr. April 29th. He advises not to take a second dose of Pfizer at this time and prescribes her an EpiPen.

Client appeared &#34;unsteady on her feet&#34;. EMT rushed to patient and guided her slowly to the ground while protecting her head. Patient then fainted. EMTs assisted patient to gravity bed where patient regained consciousness. Patient was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and event (AAO x 4) immediately following the incident. Client&#39;s vitals were assessed every 5 minutes. They were recorded as follows 10:19- Blood Pressure (BP) 100/74, Heart Rate (HR) 86, Oxygen Saturation (SPO2) 99%, and Respiratory Rate (RR) 18; 10:24- BP 100/72, HR 81, SPO2 99% RR 18; 10:29- BP 100/76, HR 82, SPO2 99% RR 16; 10:34- BP 102/74, HR 84, SPO2 99% RR 18; 10:39- BP 100/72, HR 82, SPO2 99% RR 18; 10:44- BP 110/76, HR 86, SPO2 99% RR 18. Client was given a bottle of water and instructed to remain in a semi-fowler&#39;s (45 degree) position until vitals stabilized. Patient remained on vaccination site for 30 minutes following the episode of fainting. EMT obtained orthostatic vital signs (vital trend from lying down, to sitting, to standing). Patient was negative for orthostatic hypotension. Symptoms resolved as indicated above in vital signs. Patient stated she was &#34;feeling better&#34; and declined EMS transport. Patient and father were educated by RN on home care (rest and fluids) and to seek emergency medical attention if symptoms persisted or worsened. Patient left the vaccination site at 10:45 with father and sister with steady gait and in no change in status.

Her dad came to check on her, she broke down saying that her arms were numb and chest was tight. The 15 vaccine minute timer went off, client stood but legs were week. She sat down and then slid herself onto the floor. She at first went into a fetal position then laid out flat on the floor.

Ambulance arrived quickly and client was taken to the Medical Center via ambulance.

It was worsened by laying flat and relieved somewhat by sitting upright or forward.  NSAIDS were slightly effective at improving the pain.  It took about a week to totally resolve.  The patient went to a walk-in clinic initially and they noticed right-axis deviation on an EKG and sent her to the Hospital for further workup. She was discharged from the ER several hours later with no clear diagnosis but a suggestion that it sounded clinically like a viral pericarditis.

                                                Patient became light headed and fainted from a seated position about 10 minutes after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination. She doesn&#39;t think she lost consciousness. Her skin was quite warm and sweaty after this event. I had her remain laying down on the ground while she recovered and I assessed her symptoms. She felt better almost immediately so I had her move to the pharmacy office for observation for an additional 15-20 minutes. She then reported that she has fainted with shots before and she hadn&#39;t eaten anything today. Her mother said this has happened before and drove her home once she felt well again.

She does not remember the event, but was at a friend&#39;s house and was found in the bathroom after they heard a bang and was noted to be shaking. She then passed out again and continued shaking. She texted her mom and was given a cold rag on her forehead but has no recollection of any of that. Afterwards, she returned to normal.

On Wednesday, May 19the she woke up and said that she had a terrible time in the middle of the night with a tight chest and she couldn&#39;t catch her breath. She wouldn&#39;t go to Urgent Care with me so I told her that we had to call the 24 hour nurse line (on the back of the insurance card). I called and she spoke with a nurse, then spoke with a doctor on the phone who told her to go the doctor if her symptoms got any worse.

                                                Less than 1 minute after received the shot, patient became clammy and pale while sitting in chair. Her eyes rolled back in her head and her body went slack. Myself (parent) and the nurse who had given the shot braced her on either side while she appeared to fade in and out of consciousness for several minutes (she seemed to occasionally interact with us, mumbling responses to &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; questions). The nurse did not want to lower her to the floor, but wanted to keep her propped on the chair. Her head kept rolling to the side. At one point, she began to jerk rhythmically.  Just as I was about to bring this to the attention of the nurse, the patient returned to consciousness. Patient was moved to a rolling recliner chair and taken to a recovery area where I (parent) did not see her for another 30 minutes as I was receiving my own shot. The chair she had sat in was wet, but it was assumed this was due to sweat (patient had sweated profusely).  On the way out of the clinic, noticing a wet stain on the back side of patient&#39;s pants, I asked if she had wet her pants (quietly) two separate times. Patient denied it both times. However, upon returning home, patient confirmed that she had wet her pants.  Patient was monitored during the evening for similar adverse events ; none noted.  Patient ate lunch approximately 1 hour before receiving shot and was given crackers while at clinic. Patient is a well-hydrated individual, and also drank water while on-site. No fever either before or after shot. A slightly elevated BP the next day (135/83). However, patient complained of headache, fatigue, and pain at injection location; elevated BP may be related to headache and/or ordeal from day of the shot.

Once EMS arrived, patient had had resolution of blurred vision and the sweating. Her vitals were normal. Her mom refused further treatment to the hospital. I recommended to follow up with pediatrician.

When I reached the patient, she was shaking and then came through and stopped shaking. Patient was still pale, sweating, and didn&#39;t feel okay. 911 was already called once the patient was shaking. As I am checking in on the patient, the mom discloses that she has fainted at least twice before and when she comes through she shakes but it is not seizures. However, during the screening process, patient and mom stated the patient never had any problems when getting vaccinated. I got her BP checked and it was 102/61 and HR of 92. We had the patient sit still and drink water. When EMS arrived within 5-10 mins, they took her vitals and it was 112/70s and HR of 84 with 98% O2 sat. Patient and mom decided to be taken to the ED to make sure she is okay.

We took her to Hospital Pediatric ER on Thursday, the ambulance took her in because she had a seizure on Wednesday (the Ambulance - they stabilized her that day and  took her vitals and was sure she was okay - they knew we had an appt to go in the next day at 10:00 am for tests (previously scheduled); Thursday morning she had another seizure - we gave her seizure meds and she came out  that - she ate breakfast after and then took her regular meds and the next thing we know ,50 minutes later, her head drop forward and her arms go completely limp and there was no response. She was breathing but she was out. I called the ambulance. And they took her in to ER. What they put in the paperwork was that she had a seizure and they wrote that she had  had syncope episode - it took 20 minutes to come out of it. Which she has never had anything like that. We were in the ER for 7 hours. Was admitted to Hospital -from 24th -28th.

                                                I saw and evaluated the patient. I agree with the findings and the plan of care as documented in the Fellow note.  Of note patient is a 17yo male with no significant past medical history who received the second dose of his Pfizer COVID19 vaccine on 5/25/21. This morning he woke up with chest pressure and eventually was seen at an outside hospital ED. EKG was concerning for possible myocarditis and he was transferred further work-up of myocarditis. On arrival, echocardiogram was performed demonstrating grossly normal LV function with some suggestion of apex hypokinesis. EKG was repeated and showed ST elevation in lead I and V1. Troponin was elevated at 1.11. On exam, no murmurs rubs or gallops. No known family history cardiomyopathy. I personally reviewed the echocardiogram. Overall, patient is a 17yo male with what appears to be myocarditis that is temporally associated with the second dose of the MRNA Pfizer COVID19 vaccine. We have seen several of these patients with similar presentations over the past few weeks and most seem to respond well to treatment with IVIG and steroids. We will confer with our Rheumatology and ID colleagues. Plan will be to obtain cardiac MRI in the next 24 hrs. Ibuprofen PRN for pain. Will trend troponin and EKG.

Doctor initially thought it could be a simple case of Acid Reflux and gave her Nexium. Once that didn&#39;t work, she had her Chest X Ray done that came back all clear. She then had her blood tests done and that too came all clear except for Vitamin D3 that came in at 15 so doctor gave her a 50,000 unit Vitamin D3 dose. That also didn&#39;t do much to relieve the chest pains and shortness of breath so he had her EKG and Echo done and those were all clear as well. Finally, he gave her a  day steroid course of Prednisone at 40 mg/day which is where  she is currently. It is helping her a bit but she is still complaining of original two issues - chest pain and shortness of breath. She is also doing cold and warm compressions throughout the day that helps her temporarily.

                                                The patient felt dizzy and weak then fainted while her mom was holding her . Her mom gradually led her to the floor from a sitting position. She felt nauseous and dizzy. I laid her on floor with her feet elevated on a chair with her head to the side so she would not aspirate if she vomitted.. She felt better after a while and wanted to sit. When she was sitting in the armchair she vomitted and said she felt worse, so I then called 911.   They evaluated her and her blood pressure was very low and they gave her iv fluids and took her to the emergency room

                                                Patient was very anxious and breathing heavy. About 5 minutes after the vaccination they started to hyperventilate and ended up throwing up. After letting them sit and relax for 5 minutes, the patient then had to throw up again and told their mother they felt like they were going to faint. Mother and myself stood by, while patient did end up fainting. We slowly lowered them to the ground, and on the way down their body got stiff and patient had uncontrollable movements and was hardly responsive. Mother and myself finally got her safely to the floor as they came to and was responding to verbal ques and stimulation from mother. Mother went to get water and i stayed with the patient to ensure no other things happen. Patient ended up doing alright after relaxing for a few and then i walked them and mother to their car and ensured they were feeling good enough to go home. I then advised the mother to seek medical attention.

He is an athlete and not able to do any of the sports  - he starts breathing heavily when he walks across the room. He couldn&#39;t attend school for over a month. Has been to several physicians - a pulmonologist several times; cardiologist; gastroenterologist; his pediatrician. He got a steroid shot - 24th,  given to him for the headaches. Last Monday, the 24th of May (the pulmonologist gave this to him).  It (the headaches pain) was really bad on Tuesday, Wed, Thursday and he started feeling better with the headaches on Friday. He has been given an inhaler and Pepcid for acid reflux (gastroenterologist). These have given him a little relief - but he don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the steroid shot or the inhaler that is helping. Yesterday he tried to go to his Sports class and he couldn&#39;t do it - there was a problem with breathing; a lot of shortness of breath. The headaches and the breathing issues are still what are debilitating him the most.

                                                Patient told us that she has passed out and vomited after receiving vaccines in the past. After getting the vaccine, she didn&#39;t feel well. We monitored her in the vaccine room for about 5 minutes. She had a drink of water, then when she was ready, her family helped her into the lobby I returned to the pharmacy, and continued to watch her. The patient&#39;s mom came to the window and said patient had fainted. I went to her, and said we need to lower her to the floor. At that point, mom said patient was not breathing I quickly lowered her to the floor, while dad supported her head. I didn&#39;t have time to verify that she wasn&#39;t breathing, because as soon as she touched the floor, she began convulsing, then sat up and w was immediately awake. She sat up, and we explained that she had passed out and I had her lie down. I stayed with her for a few minutes, asking if they wanted an ambulance (which mom and dad declined) while making sure she was ok. She was just resting at this point, so I returned to the pharmacy, and ask them to let me know if anything changed I continued to watch her from the pharmacy window, and the patient said she was nauseated. We gave mom a bag, and patient vomited in the bag. After a couple more minutes, she seemed to be recovering, and mom and dad helped her out of the store. I followed up with mom at 4:15pm, and mom said patient was still nauseated and had vomited a couple more times. I followed up one last time at 4:45pm, and patient was feeling a bit better, but mom was going to keep an eye on her I recommended that mom take her to a doctor to be evaluated, but mom said she would just keep an eye on her through the night. I told mom that I would follow up again in the morning.

                                                The day after the second dose of the vaccine she started to have pains in all of her joints. Her chest felt painful and even her finger joints.  It was a constant pain that got worse with movement. The pain scale without the medication was an 8 but with the medication a 5 on the scale of 1-10. Ibuprofen and Hydrocodone helped control the pain but it did not make it totally go away. The joint pain lasted for three weeks to date but the chest pain has improved. Heat pads also help.

RPh advised patient to wait in the waiting room for 15 minutes to make sure she felt fine. Around 3 PM patient told another patient sitting in the waiting room that she was feeling light headed and told her to call the pharmacy staff, which she did. One of the RPhs went out of the pharmacy into the waiting room to check up on her while the other pharmacist called 911. RPh who went to check up on her found her on the floor slouching. RPh tried to shake her awake and she appeared nodding off and on. Finally after a minute of two, she became more coherent and conscious. Team member grabbed orange juice to give to her. Other patient who grabbed our attention stated she was slowly sliding off her chair. RPh stayed by her side until paramedics arrived. Although she marked &#34;No&#34; on Section B #5 on the VAR form, she stated that she gets light headed and dizzy whenever she gets blood drawn or at the dentist. Paramedics checked on her vitals, was within normal range. Patient opted not to be taken to the hospital. RPh advised patient to call a  family member to pick her up because although she felt ok to drive, she stated she felt a little nauseous and her head kind of hurts. Mother picked her up about an hour after the incident occurred.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 10:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to Red dye, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heart murmur, Wilkies syndrome. The patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not take other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took Excedrin and experienced allergies. The patient previously received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Feb2021 09:45 AM (Lot Number: EL9269) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. On 24Feb2021 at around 7:00pm she started getting a migraine at the base of her head. She then was lethargic, and became extremely nauseous. She started getting extremely cold and then hot within a matter of minutes (inability to control temperature regulation). Her heart rate rose to around 133 just laying down. Her ribs and lungs hurt. And her stomach began to have a really intense stabbing pains. At one point it felt as if she could feel every cell in her body if that makes sense. Not the worst pain she had experienced but definitely not pleasant. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being run over by a car and 1 being a paper cut) she would say it was a 5-6. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Facility type vaccine was facility. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and did not have COVID test post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

                                                The Pfizer shot was given at 1:30. We shopped at the store for 15 minutes (they didn&#39;t have a waiting area to sit down). We left the store. As I (her mother) was driving home she passed out and her head almost hit the dashboard. I grabbed her head and pulled into a parking spot. She was white as a ghost. I called 911. The ambulance arrived 6-8 minutes later. She was speaking incoherently to the paramedics and her blood pressure was extremely low. They transported her to the Medical Center. Her blood pressure was monitored and she was given a bag of fluids. We were there over 2 hours before she was released. They said it was Vasovagal Syncope and the paramedic said he had a few similar calls shortly after the Covid-19 shot had been administered (I hope they are all reporting it).  A friend of ours called us and told us his daughter passed out after the Pfizer shot just last week. She was at  (college in out of state) and got her shot there. They didn&#39;t report it or anything. I think this needs to be looked into. Especially in regards to younger people.

                                                bleeding; less soreness at the injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 18-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration administrated on left arm on 05Apr2021 at 16:00 at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other medications in two weeks. The patient did not have any known allergies. She received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, Lot number: EN6204, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administrated on left arm on 14Mar2021 at 15:00 (03:00 PM) at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 05Apr2021 04:00 PM, reported that the 2nd dose of vaccine caused unusual amount of bleeding after needle was removed. The patient had to clean excess blood after the shot. The band aid was soaked with blood. The patient experienced less soreness at the injection site compared to the first vaccine shot. The concern is whether the vaccine was bled out due improper injection. She did not have any other vaccine in four weeks before the covid-19 vaccine dose. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. She was not having COVID prior to the vaccination, neither was tested for Covid-19 post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date in 2021.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after vaccine administered, patient started feeling nauseous and dizzy. She was also pale and clammy.  Offered patient water and allowed to remove face mask. Instructed on breathing slowly in through the nose and out through the mouth. This helped briefly but then patient verbalized that she was feeling more light headed and thought she should lie down on exam table. Remained at patient&#39;s side but did not allow her to stand up in order to relocate from chair to exam table. Approximately 7 minutes after vaccine administration, patient briefly lost consciousness for less than 30 seconds and had slight jerking movements during this time. Remained at patient&#39;s side and prevented her from falling out of chair, hitting head, or other injury during syncopal event. After patient regained consciousness, she began sipping on water. A cold, wet paper towel was placed to the back of her neck. Continued to observe patient in exam room for another 5 minutes then she was escorted to waiting area by provider. Waiting area was just outside exam room and patient remained in the presence of a patient care technician, as well as her mother. Patient remained in waiting area for a total observation time of 30 minutes. No other adverse events occurred. Patient and mother both reported that patient does not do well after vaccines and has had similar symptoms after other vaccines in the past.

After establishing that the patient was conscious and breathing. We initiated the emergency protocol.  The EMTs came and checked blood pressure and blood sugar.  The patients dad also came in and after concluding that the patient was okay they decided to forgo  going to the hospital.   They went home on their own accord.  I called them again after 3 hours to verify that they were still okay.

                                                Patient was near syncope. After receiving the vaccine about 2 minutes she started getting light headed. Patient was given water and animal crackers to get. She was feeling a little better but when she turned her head she still felt lightheaded. I had her eat and drink some more water. I asked how she was feeling. She stated that she was feeling better so i had her sit the rest of the way up with her feet hanging over the bed. I asked how she was feeling. She stated that she was feeling good. I then had her stand up with me standing in front of her and asked how she was feeling. She stated that she was feeling light headed in the middle of her forehead. I had her sit back down and gave her an ice pack to put on her neck. I then asked how she was feeling and she stated that she was feeling better and while she had the ice pack on her forehead she kept eating and drinking. I then had her stand up and she stated that she was better. i took her vitals at 11:24 am heart rate 75, o2 99 and BP 115/81, again at 11:30 am heart rate 79, o2 97 and BP 117/82. I released her to go home with her mom and dad at 11:41.

I went to my doctor and they suspected I could have appendicitis and also symptoms from the vaccine. They suggested going to the ER after 3 days if systems persisted. I went home after the doctor visit and was nauseous. I had sprite, ate white rice and chicken broth. My abdomen felt a bit better but I had a bad headache. 5/8/21 - Saturday I awoke at 6am with stabbing/burning chest pain that increased as time progressed. The chest pain was increasing and getting worse after 1 hour and 30 minutes. The pain was in the middle of my chest. My mom took me to the Emergency Room.

After she came to in about 10 seconds I offered her a cold compress for her head. After a couple of minutes the patient felt good enough to move to observation area. I started getting a vaccine ready for another patient and this patient saw the needle and fainted again. I rushed over to her chair and kept her from falling. After she came to in about 10 seconds I offered to call 911 but the patient refused. Her brother came over from shopping and after a couple more minutes they decided to leave together.

                                                The first dose of the vaccine went fairly well aside from fever, muscle aches, and pain in the left arm at the injection site. The second dose was reportedly worse. The fever ranged from 104.8 degrees Fahrenheit as a high and 102 degrees Fahrenheit being low, which receded after 3 days of care. In addition, chest pains and heart pain started at 8:00pm the day of the vaccination which was completed at 11:15am. Pain at the injection site and overall body muscle aches lasted for 3 days.   The heart/chest pains have yet to recede. Instead it is occurring more frequently in ?bursts? of pain with a constant aching sensation.

I spoke to the patient and when she said she was ok I had her sit down on the chair. After about 15 minutes patient and father left and confirmed that she was doing ok.  Next morning patients dad called and said she was doing fine, that we might need to fill out paper work regarding the incident to submit it at patients school so she would not have to take the second dose.

                                                Tachycardia; Lost 14 pounds; Ulcerative colitis flare up; Throat and glands swollen; Throat and glands swollen; vomiting a lot and couldnt hold food and water down; Diarrhea; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (reporting on herself). A 18-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0150; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 07Apr2021 13:30, as 1st dose, single dose and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0171; Expiration Date: was not reported ) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 28Apr2021 12:30, as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 2015 and ongoing. Additional Information for Other Conditions: states was in remission for 6 years prior to her second dose of the vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that she had a pretty severe reaction to her second dose of BNT162B2. States she has been in the hospital for 5 days last week and has now been in the hospital for 4 days this week because of side effects from vaccine that she received on 28Apr2021 which was her second dose. She thought the side effects would go away after the first hospitalization but was readmitted. First admitted to the hospital on 01May2021 for severe reaction to the shot for 5 days then was sent home because they thought the side effects would go away but the side effects have still been heavy. She was admitted again on Friday (14May2021) to the hospital from the side effects that are continuing. States she had lost 14 pounds from the time she was home from her first visit to the hospital. Patient vomiting a lot and couldnt hold food and water down: States that right after she got the second shot a couple of hours later she vomited a lot and couldn&#39;t hold food or water down which started 28Apr2021 and that she hasn&#39;t thrown up since Friday 14May2021, but has improved. She was starting to recover from it, it was just starting to get better. The really bad diarrhea started on the 28Apr2021 and was ongoing. The doctor thinks the second dose of the vaccine caused an ulcerative colitis flare up. She noticed the tachycardia on 29Apr2021. States her resting heart rate before the vaccine was 55 on average and now her resting rate was 105-115, and when she gets up to walk around it was 140-160. States that this was what was preventing her to be able to leave the hospital now. Tachycardia was the reason for admission for the first hospitalization. she was at urgent care she was tachycardic and her throat and glands were all swollen and they thought she needed to be admitted to the hospital. Swollen glands recovered last week, either 12 or 13May2021 and was completely recovered from that. Clarifies throat and swollen glands recovered 13May2021. Her dates of admission were 01May2021- 04May2021 for tachycardia. States she was currently at hospital and was admitted 14May2021 and was still there today for tachycardia and weight loss. States the tachycardia warranted both hospital admissions but the weight loss also contributed to the second admission as well. States her current weight was 116 after losing 14 pounds. She was weighed on the 4th when discharged from her first hospital admission and she weighed 130 pounds or 59 kilograms then had a follow up appointment with her cardiologist on the 14th for tachycardia and was weighed then and was 116 pounds at that time. They then sent her to the emergency room right after that follow up appointment to be admitted. States she hasn&#39;t been weighed again during this hospital admission so she thinks her weight was the same. She coughed and said sorry something got stuck in her throat, then continued her conversation. Ulcerative Colitis flare up- states she was unsure of when it transitioned from diarrhea to this flare up of ulcerative colitis. States she has just starting getting steroids and they increased her normal medications for her condition and was starting to improve. States she has a picture of her vaccine card and the events started after her 2nd dose. They did a procedure to confirm it was flare up at around 15:00 on 17May2021, performed a sigmoidoscopy and just found her left colon and rectum were inflamed as results which was similar to the ulcerative colitis flare up. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included heart rate: 55, heart rate: 105-115, heart rate: 140-160 on an unspecified date, sigmoidoscopy: found her left colon and rectum were inflamed as r on 17May2021. The outcome of the ulcerative colitis flare up was recovering, for event tachycardia, diarrhea and on 29Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered , lost 14 pounds was not recovered, and for vomiting a lot and couldnt hold food and water down was unknown and for events throat and glands swollen was recovered on 13May2021.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

That lasted the entire night.  24 hours after the injection and I am still feeling tightness in my chest when I breathe, sore throat, and sore muscles.

                                                I was tired that night and slept until 11:00 am or 12 pm and muscle aches and body aches were noticed when I woke up. Thursday night, My heart started racing very quickly and it lasted for 30 minutes - my whole chest was hurting really bad and my heart was beating hard. I had a monitor  - 207 beats per minutes. Blood pressure was normal. ER - monitored my heart. I think they gave me some medication. They gave me a heart monitor to check my heart for next 14 days. There was not another occurrence.

                                                Got second dose of vaccine the morning of March 10th.  Had the &#34;expected&#34; symptoms of fatigue, headache, and chills the evening of March 10th. Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

I decided to leave after sitting for 20 minutes and go back to work because it got a little better. on tuesday.   A few hours later, my chest started to ache and my throat started to hurt. thinking I had asthma due to the heat, i ignored it and used my inhaler.   By the next day, I was coughing and it hurt worse. I was still dizzy but worse, felt neasious and had a headache. I used my inhaler twice with no help. My arm started to hurt to move, and my injection spot became a red lump.   By Thursday, I could barely take a normal breath. It hurt to walk, talk, yawn, sneeze or anything that lifted my need to breathe above bare minimum. It hurt greatly and I couldn&#39;t take a full breath. I felt like my lungs were swollen and my throat hurt to swallow. I was very dizzy and had horrible nausea.

History is consistent with vasovagal syncopal episode given resolution of symptoms in a quick period of time. Must also consider anaphylactic reaction to vaccine given patient had vomiting and low blood pressures following vaccine administration. However, this is less likely given that patient returned to baseline blood pressures without any additional interventions and has had no additional episodes of vomiting since presenting to the emergency department. Must also consider pregnancy given vomiting and recent Plan B usage

My eyes unfocused, I got slightly nauseous, I went absent, and my heart raced. I couldn?t focus the rest of the night I felt very off and strange. It was very sudden and scary. I shook for like 30 minutes after. It has been happening on and off in very short durations for four days now.

Duration of seizure symptoms was 12 minutes. &#39;  The patient regained consciousness, symptoms resolved, and patient was discharged home with family following increased observation.  No medication treatment needed.  Upon chart review, it was identified that she has a similar reaction following her 1st Pfizer dose.  On 3/28/21, the patient received Pfizer (Lot ER8730 in the left deltoid).  Following her 15 minute observation period, she rose from her chair and fell to the ground unconscious.  She was taken to the treatment tent and observed to have &#39;seizure like jerking of upper and lower extremities, fluttering eyelids, unarousable.&#39;  Vitals stable (BP=103/68, HR =111, SpO2=98%).  Patient and family described this seizure as similar to the ones she experiences due to stress/anxiety.  Symptoms resolved, no medication treatment needed.

As soon as the pharmacist ran to help her, she looks seriously pale, nauseous, sweaty, and then lost all her faculty. She said she could not see anything and started to feel difficult of breathing. The pharmacist immediately gave her EpiPen, and called 911. While waiting for EMS, she started to feel a bit better, could see things. EMS came, measured her blood pressure, and told that she got syncope. They transported her to the hospital.

                                                Within 5 minutes of receiving vaccine daughter felt something was not right as we sat in 15 minute holding period. She was holding her chest. I advised her to sit and I would get help.  as I turned she was standing next to me holding her chest saying she isnt feeling right.  they put her on a bed and was looking for a blood pressure cuff.  they placed a pulseox on her finger which showed 100.  then they placed another clip on her other finger and it showed her heart rate increasing to 138 from 93 in seconds. her face was red her neck was red and she said her heart was racing.   they finally found a BP cuff and her blood pressure was 148/94 which they said this was normal.  it was not. they they told us to seek medical attention.  She continued to complain about chest pain and racing and her face and next continued to be red.  the nurse then gave her 50ml of benadryl with no relief.  She was taking out by wheelchair to a waiting ambulance then to the Hospital Emergency Room.  They treated her with a Steroid and IV.  She was released after about 3 hours.  we came home and 2 hours later went back to the same Emergency room for the same chest pain and racing  at which point  she now had a rash on chest and neck.  this time they gave her medicine to slow down her heart which made her feel better.  she was then released.   Since then she continues to have heart papatations and rashes, and a heard time swallowing with a continue feeling something is stuck in her throat.

The pt then stood up to leave the vaccination area and slouched to the ground. She went unconscious for about 4 seconds. When she came to she was awake, alert, and oriented. Paramedics were called to ensure the pt didn&#39;t suffer injury. After an evaluation by the paramedics the pt was released and her friends picked her up.

The clinical team transferred patient to the Assessment Tent, where she was observed to have seizure-like jerking of her upper &amp; lower extremities and fluttering of the eyelids while she remained unconscious. She had normal pulse and respiration during this time, no tongue biting or urinary or stool incontinence. Within approximately 10 minutes her seizure-like movements resolved, and she gradually regained consciousness. I spoke with the patient afterwards: she recalls having stood to meet with her father, and then she has no recollection of the event.

After about 5 minutes she fainted in the chair and appeared to have a seizure. We called 911 and we were able to get her to talk to us but she appeared to go in and out of it. After the paramedics arrived she became better and better. She was able to walk out of the store with her mom and appeared fine. We spoke with her dad later that evening and she was doing well.

                                                At 7:40 pm on 04/27 I received my second Pfizer COVID19 shot. I felt okay for the rest of the night and went to bed around 2am that night. The next day, I woke up around 10:30am and was sore until about 12pm when I began to feel completely awful. I was tired and no pain reliever helped with the muscle aches in my shoulders and back. I felt like my chest was being weighed down and it felt like a horrible chore to even breathe. About 24 hours after the shot, under my jaws began to hurt terribly and ice didn&#39;t do much to help it. I finally fell asleep on 04/28 around 2am and woke up on 04/29 without any pain.

Her L arm pain got progressively worse. She then received the 2nd dose of pfeizer vaccine on 4/19/2021 this time she got it in her R arm because of the pain  in her L arm. Her L arm pain got worse to the point she was not able to feel her entire L arm. So she decided to go the ER

                                                nausea; passed out; seizure; enlarged heart; hurt knee; sore mouth; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 19-year-old female non-pregnant patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 20Apr2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 19-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no history of COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine: 2nd dose of Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine on 06Apr2021 in the right arm. On 20Apr2021 22:30, the patient experienced passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, enlarged heart, and nausea.  The patient reported, &#34;I was fine all day until around 10:30 pm I went into my mothers room and she was asking me how my arm feels I told her it was fine and right after saying that she said I passed out in front of her and then I began to have a seizure for about 50 seconds and then I woke up. After waking up from the event I had a hurt knee and sore mouth as well as an enlarged heart. I have no history of seizures in the past so it was definitely scary.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on 20Apr2021. Therapeutic measures taken included anti seizure meds, fentanyl, and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient recovered with sequelae from the events, passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, and enlarged heart. Outcome of nausea was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time. However, the information provided is very limited and does not allow for a complete medical assessment. Case will be reassessed if additional information is received. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

She was hooked to a heart monitor throughout the night.  Discharged with treatment plan the next day 5/22.

                                                We left the store and got a bite to eat at the drive through. After driving about 7 minutes she grabbed her throat and started acting like she was not able to swallow. I asked her was she ok? She stated no in a raspy voice. She shook her head and said she felt like molasses was in her throat. She seemed pale and began to sweat. I am a former EMT-Parmamedic. I remembered there was a store about 2 miles away. I called  and got the Pharmacist on the phone. I ran into the  after driving 92 miles an hour and she converted children&#39;s Benadryl for me and stayed on the phone. I gave her 1/2 a bottle. began to be more responsive. I had a medical bag with me with airways and other medical devices I use for work but no Epi Pen. After giving her all the Benadryl she said she felt better but she stayed hoarse for the remainder of the day and was sleepy. I kept an eye on her an Called her physician on Monday morning as this was a Saturday and they called in Epi pens in case this happens again. The first shot she felt like she swallowed a potato chip wrong and started acting the same way then through up but never got this bad. We just thought she ate something and it went down the wrong way. Never giving it a second thought. Then after the second shot it was much worse. Had I not the pharmacist on the phone, Benadryl liquid and a medical bag, I would have called an ambulance. In the county we live in though we do not have enough ambulances and I am afraid she would have went into full anaphylaxis and died. I did what I thought was the best for my only child.

We administered the Pfizer shot in the left arm and was asked to stay in the store for 15 to 20 minutes to make sure she di not have an adverse reaction. She walked to the front of the store and and started felling dizzy, therefore, mom had patient sit down on the floor. Our store manager noticed she was on floor and cam over to offer assistance. Pt&#39;s mom said she pass out and was not feeling good. I was paged and upon going to front of the store saw the patient on the floor. I came up to and ask how she&#39;s feeling and noticed she was flushed and warm. An associate got her some water and a chair. Our store manager offered to call 911 and mom did not want an ambulance called and after 15 to 20 minutes of sitting in the chair drinking water, patient was able to leave the store with no assistance. I called to check on Pt at 5:30pm and she was feeling good with no other issues.

She lost consciousness for less than a minute.  She lost color in her skin and was confused when she woke up.  Her mother and brother were with her and called for help.  The pharmacist and a technician also went out to assist.  Patient was seated in the chair and assisted the whole time not to fall out or get up and walk after waking back up.  She was given a cold compress and water.  Her blood pressure was taken and was WNL. We asked them to stay in the pharmacy an additional 15-30 minutes after to watch over her.  Her mother and brother were able to stay with her in the waiting room.  After resting for an additional 20 minutes patient was able to walk out on her own and color returned to her body.  Her mother felt comfortable taking her home at this point.  Patient is very nervous about shots and had little to eat today.

No other local or systemic allergic type signs or symptoms noted.  Client appeared anxious and admitted to same.  Responding well to reassurance.  She normally takes hydroxyzine PRN for anxiety, and we offered diphenhydramine which she accepted (50mg po x 1).  Feeling improved prior to discharge, this is NOT suspected to be a severe adverse reaction to the vaccine (suspect panic/anxiety).

                                                chest pain; tachycardia; cold sweats; shakes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional. A 20-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on an unspecified date (at the age of 20-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) administered in arm left on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient ended up in the hospital with chest pain, tachycardia, shakes and cold sweats, 5 hours after receiving second dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: unknown results on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine can not be excluded for the reported events of chest pain, tachycardia, shakes and cold sweats due to temporal relationship.  Case will be re-assessed upon the additional information provided. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

These symptoms lasted throughout the night into the morning. In the morning on Saturday (3/27), and for most of the day I felt fatigued and slightly nauseous. At 5:00 PM that night, I was walking in the hall of my residence when I experienced a syncopal episode, which has never happened to me before. I fainted several times and my roommate brought me to the ER. Other than low BP, my EKG and other vitals looked fine, and the doctor sent me home with the conclusion it was likley related to the vaccine. The next day, Sunday 3/28, I felt naseua and dizziness all day.

EMS was called to the scene and the patient was evaluated after having a near syncopal episode just prior to their arrival.  EMS stayed on scene for approximately 30 minutes and evaluated the patient in the ambulance.  Staff was advised that the patient ended up feeling better after evaluation and refused care from EMS, leaving with her family.  No further information was obtained.

                                                Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. Upon administration, patient reported she felt as though she was having an anxiety attack. She then fainted and started falling forward in her chair. The pharmacist and technician caught the patient as she fell forward and as they were leaning her back in the chair she began seizing in their arms for approximately 5-10 seconds (no more than 20-30 seconds). At this point, the patient spoke and stated that was weird and said she felt lethargic. Another technician was on the phone with 911 at this time. We gave her a bottle of water and kept the patient seated in the immunization room until EMS arrived. She was complaining of being very hot and lethargic. EMS arrived and checked her vitals and recommended the patient go with them to the hospital due to B/P and pulse being very low (exact vitals were not communicated to us). She agreed to go to the hospital and we will be following up with the patient tomorrow.

                                                experiencing passing a ton of clots; I washed my face, it got extremely red; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 20-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 20-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 19Jan2021 13:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included lupus and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Concomitant medications included mycophenolate mofetil (CELLCEPT), esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM), medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPOPROVERA), and propranolol; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient has known allergies to rituximab and amoxicillin. As a woman, the patient was having a lot of blood clots being passed. The patient doesn&#39;t get a period because of depo, but for some reason, she was experiencing passing a ton of clots on an unspecified date. Also, after the first dose, when she washed her face, it got extremely red on an unspecified date in 2021 (She did the same in the days before and that didn&#39;t happen). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid test: negative on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown. No treatment was received for the events. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 on 11Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation administered at the left arm.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine was injected, I felt like I got slugged in the arm. I also had a momentary hot flash. Then, I went to go sit in the waiting area, and I continued to get warmer and warmer. After 5 minutes, I went up to the front desk, and told them I didn?t feel well and that I felt like I was overheating. They put me in a wheelchair, and I immediately passed out and hallucinated for a minute or two. I felt incredibly weak, and I had sweat completely through my shirt. A paramedic came and put me in a stretcher in a cornered off area of the clinic. After 30 minutes or so, I started feeling better, but I got several spirts of cold flashes. All of my vitals came back normal.

                                                small clot behind my left knee; left foot had swollen; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 20-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: ER2613) first dose on 20Mar2021 10:15 on left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient is not pregnant. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination, No known allergies. She took the vaccine around 10:00am and around 6:00pm (also reported as 06:30 PM) she noticed that her left foot had swollen. She consulted with her general physician and he requested that patient did an Ultra Sound exam of her left leg. The result of the exam reported a small clot behind her left knee. Therefore, doctor suggested that she reported these events to Pfizer so an evaluation is made to identify if similar events have occurred with other patients. She was concerned if she should take the second shot on 17Apr2021. AE resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Patient received Eliquis 5mg (two times daily) as treatment. Patient had Nasal Swab on 01Apr2021 and tested negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                20 yr old Female patient received first dose Pfizer covid19 vaccine in left arm administered by pharmacy intern at 3:27pm .  supervising pharmacist was (Name) pharmD.   Prior to patient receiving the covid19 vaccine  pharmD reviewed and went over all the DUR and digital patient questionnaire questions.  Mother of patient was present and mentioned that in the patient&#39;s past , the patient had fainted after receiving a vaccine.  PharmD told patient that because this occurred in the past, the patient will have to wait 30 minutes after vaccine administration for observation.    Patient was sitting in post-vaccination area, and about 3 minutes later patient&#39;s father notified staff , that patient felt dizzy and  looked pale and had blurry vision and patient was sweating.  PharmD  asked the patient if she had any difficulty breathing and if she felt itchy or had any rash as a result of the vaccine reaction.    We immediately called the pharmacy and notified (Name) of the situation.  The patient refused us to contact 911 and refused 911 care.  The pharmacy manager immediately arrived to the Clinic fitting room area.  Upon arrival,  the pharmacy manager provided alcohol swabs to patient to inhale because at that moment we did not have ammonia inhalants. PharmD  quickly made his way to the pharmacy to obtain the ammonia inhalants , which is a respiratory stimulant.  The pharmD returned to the Covid19 clinic with ammonia inhalants, which were never used, because we did not see the need.  Patient remained conscious the entire incident.    We decided not to  use epinephrine.   The pharmD measured the patient&#39;s blood pressure at 3:38pm .  bp reading was 109/65.  Pharmacy manager took pt temperature at 3:45pm, reading was 97F.  Pharmacy manager retook blood pressure at 4pm.  bp reading was 93/63, pulse of  72.   The pharmacy manager advised the patient to seek medical attention if patient continues to get worse.  bp was lower the second reading.  The pharmacy manager asked  patient a second time at 4pm if patient wanted us to call 911 again, and again patient refused us to contact 911.

                                                Woke up about 12hrs after vaccine and felt incredibly nauseous and had chills. I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

                                                Pfizer covid vaccine was administered to patient at around 2:10pm and was advised to stay in sight for 15 min before leaving the store. At around 2:15pm patient started to faint. Patient was accompanied by her mother. Rph on duty rushed to the scene noticed that patient had lost consciousness and started to have a seizure. I also noticed that the patient had passed urine while unconscious. I notified my technician to call 911. I quickly grabbed an EpiPen and administered one dose into the patient thigh. I assisted the patient along with her mother until the patient regained consciousness. Paramedic arrived to the seen few mins later. They checked all vital signs and patient was responding better and but still exhibiting some tingling effect in her hands. Patient decided not to ride with the paramedics. I advised her to stay for another 30 - 45 min so that I could monitor her. She was feeling much better and was released to go home along with a EpiPen.

                                                syncopal episode; dry mouth; chills; nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other health professional (patient). A 20-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose on 12Jan2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported), second dose on 02Feb2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported), both via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm, at 20-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient was not patient diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient experienced dry mouth, syncopal episode, chills, nausea on an unspecified date. The events did not result in emergency room visit or physician office visit. No treatment was received for the events. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current limited available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be totally excluded/assessed.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate

On 5/21/21 at 1723, the patient reported to our urgent care facility with a chief complaint of chest tightness (hurts when laying down), difficulty breathing, and nausea since the evening of 5/20/21. Given a recent Nexplanon insertion the day prior (5/20/21), the provider had a concern for possible PE so the patient was referred to the Emergency Department.  The patient arrived at the ED and was seen by the provider on 5/22/21 at 0416.  The patient continued to report chest discomfort as a heaviness, squeezing, ache.  The pain was constant and worse upon taking a deep breath.  Following a review of labs, EKG, Troponin, physical exam, the ED provider diagnoses &#39;chest wall pain&#39; and the patient was discharged home with instructions to f/u as an outpatient for any ongoing symptoms.  No additional chart documentation as of this report date (5/25/21).

Symptoms included headache, loss of sensation in arms, light headedness.  Patient appeared pale, and confused.  Attempted to have patient stand up and walk to counsel room opposite where she was sat.  After standing, she immediately sat down, and fainted while she was seated.  Pharmacist supported her head, and her boyfriend/significant other prevented her from falling off the chair.  Patient was momentarily unresponsive for about 3 seconds.  During this time her eyes remained open.  Once patient regained consciousness, walked her to counsel room and had her lie down on her back with her legs elevated on a chair.  Blood pressure was within normal limits.  Patient was feeling better in about 10 minutes, and continued to monitor for another 5.  Gave water to sip on, and no additional adverse effects noted.

A 20-years-old female patient (daughter) received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: ER8733, Expiry date: Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration in right upper arm on 20May2021 13:30 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medication was not reported. Patient historical vaccination was Flu vaccine on an unknown date in Sep2020 for immunization and first dose of BNT162B2 lot Number ER8733, Expiry Date: Jul2021 on 29Apr2021 at right upper arm for COVID-19 immunization and patient experienced little sore arm but it was no big deal. On 20May2021 patient experienced sore arms, had chills, her hands were very cold and her fingernails were purple. For a 3 hour period she had low grade temperature of 103.2F. Her heart was racing very fast. The mother gave her Tylenol in 15ml liquid form at 04:00 am and the temperature went down to 2 degrees. Her heart was still racing very fast at 5am. 3 hours later at 08:00 am her temperature was 101.5 F more Tylenol was given but her heart was still racing fast. Later that day it settled down. Her temperature went down to maybe a hundred and heart rate was slowly settling down. The mother said that it was really scary. They had call the doctor on Friday and talked with the nurse two times and the nurse said that they never heard anyone experienced a fever that high with the vaccine. She is asking if this was normal and if anyone has experienced this before. She is asking if ever there would be a third or booster dose, can her daughter take it after experiencing side effects after the second dose. She went back this past Thursday 20May2021 around 1:30pm for the second dose and she felt fine. About 10 hours later that night, she started not feeling well. She had gotten her second dose 3 days before and had a low grade fever, body aches, chills and didn&#39;t feel well for 24 to 48 hours. She started not feeling well and started getting chills. She was shaking really bad at 1:00 in the morning. She really didn&#39;t feel good. She took her temperature and it was 100.5. Her hands were freezing and her finger nails were purple. Her hands were cold and she was getting a fever. She guesses that can happen. Lasted a little longer from 1:00 until about 3:30 in the morning. Caller was up with her the entire night. Her fever went up to 103.2. Her heart was beating really fast. Caller was getting really scared and was thinking about taking her to the emergency room. She thought this was really weird. She gave her Tylenol trying to hold off. She was trying not to give her too much because there are dozens of interactions. She needed to give her something. Within an hour, it brought her fever down about 2 degrees and was then around 101.5. Her heart rate was still pretty fast. Was still a bit concerned but was glad her fever went down. Other than that, she seemed fine. Her daughter was drinking a lot of water to keep hydrated and was peeing a lot because she was drinking so much water. She seemed okay after that but her heart was still beating faster. Her daughter got up, she didn&#39;t sleep very much, and got up around 8:00 am, about 4 hours after taking the Tylenol. She didn&#39;t have a high fever but it was still around 101. She gave her more Tylenol and her heart was still beating fast. Reporter did not time it to see how fast it was. She could just tell that it was beating fast, like she was doing aerobics or something. Her daughter got the shot in her right arm. It really felt lumpy under her arm pit. Caller had read that some people get that, their lymph nodes get inflamed. Consumer only gave those 2 doses of Tylenol, her daughters fever got better. Her heart rate went back to normal and she seems fine now. She said her lymph nodes under her right arm seem like they are feeling better- before, she couldn&#39;t even put her arm down because they hurt so bad. She does seem to have improved; This was last Thursday and this is Tuesday. She did call the doctors office and talked to the nurse who said she hadn&#39;t heard of a fever that high. Said that sometimes when people get a fever, their heart rate can increase and that it is not unheard of. She didn&#39;t think that she had to be seen because she was improving. It bothered her the next few days. She heard on TV that kids were getting heart inflammation. Heart beating really fast: Reporter felt her wrist and felt her heart beating really fast. Lasted a little longer, until about 3:30 in the morning. Her daughters heart was beating so fast, it felt as if she were exercising but, she was sitting still. Her daughter seems fine now and caller has been checking her every day. Arm sore and lumpy under arm pit: This happened the next morning, Friday. Her daughter felt like she couldn&#39;t move and wanted to take a shower. She felt so sweaty and she couldn&#39;t touch her arm pit because it hurt so much. Reporter had read that some peoples lymph nodes get inflamed. It seemed better as the day went on. Treatment: Had  only 2 doses of Tylenol. Her daughter doesn&#39;t swallow pills, so she had given her Children&#39;s strength Tylenol that is for children ages 2-11. She had only given her 15ml, which for her wasn&#39;t a lot. It says it&#39;s for up to 80 pound kids. Gave her 15ml at 04:00 am and it did bring it down 2 degrees. She gave her the same dose at 8:00 am. It wasn&#39;t even an adult strength dose. Fever: Her daughter&#39;s fever went away. She went back to bed, she had only slept from 05:00 am to possibly 08:00am, and didn&#39;t even sleep well then. After the second dose of Tylenol, her daughter went back to bed. Later in the afternoon, when her daughter got up, it seemed like she had a fever but a low grade fever, probably around 100. She hasn&#39;t seen it go back up. It seemed like it had settled down. Caller has been checking every day. Chills: Occurred after the second dose, maybe about 10 hours after on 20May2021. Called the CDC yesterday but was not able to talk to a person. She left some messages with the vaccine adverse something but no one ever called her back.

                                                Client received her first Pfizer shot (Lot# EW0182 EXP 08/31/21) from RN at 18:40. RN stated within 20-30 seconds after administering shot, client&#39;s eyes rolled back, and she began to pass out.  The client&#39;s friend was also in the room.  RN stated that she and the friend grabbed the client, held her, and she started responding to their voices within 15 seconds.  RN stated she simultaneously called for help.  2nd RN ran down the hallway to grab EMT  and 3rd RN called 911.  From the Lead&#39;s room, Lead RN and  Co-Lead RN observed 2nd RN running down the hallway.  Leads proceeded to the hallway and observed a cluster of individuals at vaccination station 5.  Lead RN &amp; Co-Lead RN  arrived at station 5 at 18:42. Leads observed client conscious and sitting in a chair.  Thirty seconds later EMT  arrived.  Leads observed client was pale in color.  Client stated she got dizzy, and her eyes got blurry within seconds after the shot was administered.  Client stated she was hot and sweaty, but was not experiencing SOB or trouble breathing.  Client was alert and oriented times 4.  Co-Lead RN opened the window.  RN  put a wet towel on client&#39;s forehead and client was transferred to a zero-gravity chair.  Client stated she had eaten and drank plenty food and fluids earlier in the day.  At 18:48 client stated she was feeling better.  EMT took vitals at 18:50. (BP:  82/54 HR: 42).  RN took client&#39;s pulse again and stated HR:  76.  Client stated she has no known allergies and takes no medications other than birth control.  Client also stated she used to take medication for anxiety, but stopped taking the medication 6 months ago.  Firefighter EMTs arrived at 18:54 took vitals (BP:  106/74 O2: 99 HR 68) and performed a 12-lead ECG.  At this time client stated that she has never given blood because she starts to pass out when she sees blood.  She also stated that she passed out 9 months prior when she saw her sister&#39;s blood drawn at the hospital.  At 18:58 client&#39;s color was coming back.  She stated she was no longer dizzy and felt better, but was now cold because the window was open, and her jacket had been taken off to perform the ECG.  RN closed the window.  Firefighters took vitals again at 19:00 with client sitting (BP: 104/70 O2: 99 HR:  70) and standing at 19:01 (BP:  106/70 O2:  99 HR:  72).  Client stated she felt much better.  Client declined transport to hospital.  Lead RN provided client with a Pfizer fact sheet and educated client on the common side effects vs the adverse effects of the Pfizer vaccine.  Lead RN instructed her to contact her HCP if the common side effects persisted beyond 2-3 days and to go to urgent care or the ER if she experienced any adverse effects.  Lead RN also instructed client to call 911 if she experienced any respiratory issues once she was home.  RN walked client to observation room for additional 15-minute surveillance.  Client walked with a steady gait.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

The emergency provider ruled out the chest pains as NOT being cardiac or Gastrointestinal related after doing countless blood tests and other various tests. I then followed up with my PCP and they said to keep an eye on it to see if it got any worse and to seek medical attention if the chest pains did get worse. After 4 days the pain went away.

                                                One moment she was fine. The next moment she was completely pale, white as a sheet, even her lips were white. She had beads of sweat on her forehead. She said she didn&#39;t feel well, and she didn&#39;t want lunch. Then she went and vomited. We took her temperature, and it was normal. We talked to her, made sure she was oriented. She then had a bout of diarrhea in the bathroom. It took about an hour for her color to completely come back and for her to feel better. She called Pfizer and spoke to them to make a report. They told her they have not had reports like this a few days after the vaccine was given. We were not sure if she should have the 2nd round or not.

I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

                                                I received my shot at 11:47 and started to lose sensation in my hands in the waiting area. After about 25 minutes I felt dizzy and was about to stand up but my muscles started shaking. My heart rate was checked and found to be 140. This lasted for about another 30 minutes. My heart rate went down and I was taken to a private area and checked out by EMS they gave me water and concluded it was some sort of panic attack. However, these are the same symptoms I have whenever I am allergic to a medication, NSAIDS, dicyclomine, etc. It always starts with ascending numbness from my fingers to the rest of my body. Then I start to shake and my heart rate goes way up. Usually I start to cough then vomit and my airway closes. Thankfully this time we were able to slow the process and I never experienced some of the last symptoms.

Her mother is a physician and was present, providing care for her by fanning, comforting and helping her to lie down on the floor next to the waiting chairs. The patient did not faint. She did experience what appeared to be heavy breathing and light-headedness. We provided an ice pack from the immunization cart. The mother stated that the patient experiences this reaction every time she receives a vaccine due to her fear of needles. After about 30 minutes the patient was up and smiling. The family was thankful for our concern and help.

                                                i received my vaccine right about 12:30 that money and while waiting in the 15 minute clinic at the center i felt relatively fine aside for a dry mouth which i didn&#39;t even thing was a adverse reaction at the time. i processed to continue with my day and head to my 2pm class and while sitting in my class my throat which at this point was pretty itchy and felt like it was to some extent tightening. I also started to cough and wheeze profusely which is something im use to as an asthma patient but usually something has to induce that and at this point i was literally just sitting in class. i left the class and at this point it was getting extremely hard for me to breath i was coughing and wheezing essentially in a full on asthma attack. i drove to the clinic where they first gave me an albuterol nebulizer and then tried to give me a Claritin but just a few minutes after i threw up we tried again with a Benadryl and while i was able to keep that in longer i also threw up after taking that medicine. After my breathing calmed down a bit i was released to go home but there i had a fever and headache, body chills, extreme fatigue, exhaustion. nausea and  abdominal oain in my lower left side and right below my breast bone. for the rest of the night and even into today (march 23). i continued to take both Benadryl and the nebulizer over night and that has worked to help releeve symptoms but i still feel significantly unwell.

                                                Patient was nervous before the vaccination. After vaccination she started to feel hot and cold. Her hearing started to fade in and out. She sought help and was directed to lay flat on the floor and breathe. She started feeling light headed and that her vision was tunneling. Her appearance was pale and her hands were clammy. Her blood pressure was taken via wrist and was normal for her (112/72). The medical professional tending to her had her continue talking, asked her to state her DOB, name, age, the date, etc.  After about 5 minutes she started to feel better- she sat up and had some water and M&amp;Ms. She then laid back down but continued to converse with us. This took place over about10 minutes from first symptoms. She remained laying down for about 10 minutes after and then slowly sat up, and when she felt comfortable sitting she tried standing up. She then went home for the day (was an employee of the store).

                                                Around 10 minutes after getting the shot, felt sudden wave of light headedness/dizziness. About 40 minutes prior I had a snack and immediately after the shot I had another snack. I also had been drinking water. At one point I felt that I was close to passing out. I also had tingling/numbness in my feet/legs in certain positions and had to move them. I went through the drive through for the vaccine and so I sat in the car drinking water and breathing deeply for about 20-30 minutes. It gradually got better but never fully gone. When I got home some of the light headedness got a little worse when I had to stand up and walk even though I did it slowly. Even an hour after, side effects still lingering and have not yet gone as I fill this out.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm on 11Mar2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low thyroid. There were no concomitant medications. After receiving the shot of the vaccine on 11Mar2021 16:00, the patient stood up and started to feel dizzy. She was able to find a nearby chair and fainted when she sat down. When she woke up seconds later of fainting, she felt throat pain like strep throat pain and then she started feeling very intensive cramps in her lower abdomen like very intense period cramps for about 10 minutes. The patient stated that nobody in the (Pharmacy name) was prepared to react to these symptoms and the rescue took too long to come in, when they came in she was feeling better and did not see the need of going to the hospital. But it was an immediate reaction that affected 3 different parts of her body that was very painful. During the day and the day after she felt very weak with no energy to get out of bed. &#34;I am wondering if I can still receive the second dose after this reaction to the first dose?&#34; No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient was not pregnant. No known allergies. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a pharmacy drug store. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovering.

Right after getting the vaccine she experienced her throat tightening - stated she felt off- was shaky, lightheaded and heart racing. She came to the observation station- while sitting for observation she felt she wanted to get away from everyone else and came to the check in desk. Her symptoms started to subside when I escorted her to the recliner.  I gave her some Gatorade   bP 90/60 pulse 80.  She was feeling less anxious   O2 sat done at 11:51 99 % she stated she was feeling fine .  repeat BP 104/60 p 60 at noon.  I checked with lead at the clinic who agreed she should stay till 12:10 She felt fine when she left this nurse discussed the plan if she needed help would be to go to urgent care or call police if it was urgent.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after vaccine administration the patient told her mother she was dizzy while sitting in a chair outside the pharmacy. I, the pharmacist, ran to the scene and the patient was regaining consciousness as I approached. Her skin was red, and she was disoriented for a moment before asking what had happened. Her mother state she began shaking, and her head slumped as she fainted momentarily. EMS arrived and determined the patient was well enough for her mother to drive her home. The patient reported nervousness, and stated before vaccination that she had dizziness and fainting with Guardisil, but that it did not occur until 3 hours after administration while she was at home.

                                                I felt severe arm pain after the injection.  About 12 hours later I had a fever of 100.1 and went to bed.  At 1 am I went to the restroom and passed a good deal of blood as I am on my period.  I got up and then fell to the floor.  Then I went to my parents bedroom and fell again.  I drank two bottles of water and took Tylenol at that point and after about two hours I felt better and went to sleep.  I also twisted my ankle when I fell the first time.  I have never fainted nor have I had such severe cramps or passed so much blood associated with a period.

                                                Saturday morning, the arm felt sore - I did notice a little red spot. I felt fatigue and a slight headache. Saturday night  to Sunday morning , the spot got bigger (on the injection site). I drew a circle around it. It got a little bigger on Sunday. They other symptoms subsided at the end of Sunday.  The redness didn&#39;t seem to be going away on the injection site. On Monday, I just had the red arm and it hurt pretty bad to touch. It was tender and warm to the touch. I was at work and I felt shortness of breath just walking down the hall. I took my pulse while I was standing still and it was about 120. Near the afternoon, I was instructed to go to URGENT CARE to get it checked out. Closer to the afternoon, I started noticing that the heartrate  (on my watch) it got to 164. I went to URGENT CARE and they stated it was a normal reaction to vaccine but because of my tachycardia they wanted to send me to Hospital ER. At ER they weren&#39;t worried about injection site (still pretty painful) they were worried about how fast my heartrate was going. The wanted me. The injection site and the tachycardia was back to normal.

She has no medical history that she knows of. After talking to the patient, her vision improved and she stated that she feels better. Patient was transferred to observation and was observed for 30 min.

At the ED, Benadryl, Pepcid, and Solu-medrol were given and continued for 2 days during hospitalization.  No further respiratory distress developed, but the patient still had intermittent itching and rash. Patient was discharged on tapered prednisone, Benadryl as needed and Pepcid.

After 10 minutes, her body began to seize/shake for about 10-15 seconds and then she went completely limp in the chair she was seated in. I removed her mask to help with her breathing and lifted her head slightly. She began to seize/ shake again and then woke up. Patient was disoriented and reported of head pain, feeling  hot and rapid heart rate. We called 911 and EMT arrived a few minutes later, checked her vitals, which all came out normal, and spoke with the patient for a few minutes. Patient refused to go to the hospital and wanted to wait for her mother to arrive. She has no history of seizures and only takes Zyrtec OTC. The patient&#39;s mother arrived and spoke with the EMT personnel and I spoke with her as well. I recommended that the patient does not receive the second dose until she has been checked by a doctor and has been given approval to receive it. The patient recovered after about 20-30 min since the event and went home with her mother.

These symptoms included severe nausea, headache, weak/rapid heart rate, chills, muscle aches, and a fever of 101 degrees F.  Lymph nodes in the left armpit were also swollen and painful to the touch. After 10am, the chills and fever subsided, but the headache, general muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and bouts of nausea persisted (these lasted the entire day). The following day (4/23),  nausea and muscle aches subsided but the headache remained. The headache only came on whenever changing elevation of the head (standing up, sitting down, bending over), at which point it would be painful for a few minutes after moving. An extremely stiff, painful neck also began the same day (4/23) and persisted for approximately 2 days after injection (accompanied by the headache). Lymph nodes under the collar bone on the left side of the body also became swollen (4/23). Lymph nodes in armpit and under collarbone are still swollen 6 days after injection, although not painful.

                                                4 days after first shot, she called me complaining of bad back pain. She was going to her family doctor the next day for her 21 yr old well visit and was going to get it checked out then. She had a complete physical and was cleared even her lungs were clear and she was good. Tuesday night April 13th at  10pm, she told me she had &#34;air bubbles&#34; in her chest. I said you mean indigestion, take tums I said. She said not mom, actual air bubbles and they are popping in my chest. I said you just got your physical, you are fine. They Thursday night April 15th she started having difficulty breathing and was out of breath. She went to urgent care on April 16th because she felt awful and they saw in an X-ray that she had a &#34;cyst&#34; in her upper right part of her lung and her lung was about to collapse. Sent her home on bed rest with a stereos and 2 inhalers. We got her Friday night from college because the pain in her back and now her chest was worse. Took her to ER and she had a collared lung and pneuomothroax. She was admitted to the hospital and they tried to see if the lung would heal itself.  It did not. They had to do surgery to repair the hole. When they were in there they saw a cobblestone texture where the hole was an they removed that texture and repaired the hole. She has never had a lung issue. Ever. She is also the 3rd person in my family to have had an adverse reaction to the shot. 6 of us vaccinated and 3 with injuries.

                                                This is a 21 year old female who reported to the emergency department on 5/17/21 at 0917 with complaints of intermittent chest pain since the previous Tuesday (5/11/21).  She described it as light in pressure, pain 4/10, in the right upper chest/right breast area.  The patient believed her chronic anxiety may be playing a role since she has recently started a new job that involves public speaking and she had stopped her paxil due to adverse effects.  No pleuritic pain described, no pain on exertion described.  Differential diagnosis included low risk for ACS, PE given oral contraceptives, anxiety.  Given no evidence of abnormality in labs/work-up, the patient was discharged home with instructions to follow-up with PCP for any ongoing symptoms/anxiety.

                                                I received the 2nd dose of vaccine around 2pm on 01/02/21, was feeling fine until around midnight/1 am I felt chills and feverish but had a temp of 98.8 at that time, woke up around 4am with body aches, chills, fatigue, and a temp of 102.3. I was fine with these symptoms as I knew they were common side effects until my heart rate spiked from about 60 to the 160s and I began to have a throbbing headache. I could not get my heart rate to come down, I was calm and knew it was not anxiety so I went to the ER where they did blood tests, EKG, UA and gave me fluids. Everything came back normal but my heart rate continued to be elevated around 130s for a couple more hours, finally came down to about 100-110, HR is still slightly elevated and I still have a fever of 100.4 and migraine

Was feeling well prior to that.  Has soreness at her arm as well.  She has a history of POTS and did detect a rapid heart rate at home.  She has mild sinus tachycardia at this time reports a gradual improvement in symptoms.  Fever is improving, had not had any antipyretic prior to coming in.  I have low suspicion for acute infection and would favor immune response to the vaccine itself which has been reported in multiple persons receiving same vaccine.  She is not hypoxic, has clear breath sounds.  No thrombocytopenia on CBC.  IV was placed, IV fluids given.  Heart rate improved, blood pressure remained stable.  Patient feels well enough for discharge on reevaluation and declined need for analgesic or antipyretic here.

Pain is mostly at top of my lungs, going across my chest. Deep breathing sometimes helps but there?s also pain upon inhalation.  * Took the next doses of Advair and my Dexedrine (ADHD meds). Nothing weird yet just drained.   They switched my Ventolin inhaler to ProAir, I have been taking it about five times a week so I can workout. When I was on Ventolin I didn?t have any of the side effects I have with ProAir.

                                                Patient is a registered nurse at facility.  She reported having slight itchy lips and scratchy throat after 1st dose.  Patient very much wanted full protection that 2nd dose offers in order to be safe and keep family members safe.  We discussed the possibility of an increased reaction, but she wanted to go ahead and felt the benefits outweighed the risk.  I considered the fact that she is a health care professional, was fully informed and that we were at a skilled nursing facility and were prepared in case she had any reaction.  About 10 minutes after vaccination she seemed to be coughing and felt like her throat was maybe swelling.  She seemed to be breathing ok, but I asked her to take a Benadryl, which she did.  Within 5-10 minutes after that she began shaking and seemed very pale.  She said her symptoms were getting worse.  I told her I was going to administer an epi-pen dose.  911 was called, I administered the epipen, we had heart rate monitor and pulse ox monitor on patient and she was stable, but scared.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported patient to ER.  She was later released with Benadryl.

                                                About 5 mins after the shot I received on Sunday, I got a cooling effect in my chest and began to feel a bit off with an elevated HR of 132. I raised my hand to talk to a nurse and she said I was probably just nervous, got me a water, and said to continue to monitor symptoms. Then, after 15 minutes were up with no other symptoms I left the facility where I got the vaccine. The rest of the day I began to get a burning and cooling effect all around my sternum. It persisted through the day despite Tylenol 500 mg and worsened at night, keeping me up along with a slight fever and chills. The next morning I awoke with slightly lowered symptoms but the sternum pain would flare up on and off through the day and again was worse at night on Monday. So, I took a Benadryl and a 500 mg Tylenol and slept great. I woke up Tuesday feeling great with no fever and minimal chills and no sternal pain. I thought since I hit the 48 hour mark everything was going fine and I was recovering. I ran some errands and even went to the gym to do a mild workout. Then at about 6pm all the symptoms of the sternal pain flared up and was just as bad as Monday night. I took another 500mg Tylenol and 1 Benadryl again and they did not seem to work or help nearly as much as the night before. I woke up this morning with some pain in my sternum again and did not sleep much last night due to the pain as well. I have not taken any further medications at this time and I am also experiencing the worst fatigue I have so far today.

It would go back and forth between normal heart rate and the highest it got was 175bpm. After a week of this going on I followed up with my PCP had an EKG done and saw I had sinus Tachycardia. They put me on a Beta blocker from now until 2 weeks after my second dose to see if that slows my heart rate down.

Emergency Room doctors say it was very likely related to an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer Covid vaccination. Treatment included Tylenol and Ibuprofen, rest, and fluids.

                                                Developed a whole body rash 6 days after my first Pfizer vaccine. The rash was very large and covered about 80% of my body. The rash consisted of redness, small bruise spots and extreme itching. I self treated myself by taking several cool showers and took acetaminophen two times two capsules. On the second day, blotches are subsiding but I have fatigue and weariness in limbs. Skin is less red but has a sallow color and blotchy which is unusual.

                                                On Monday at around 2pm I started having severe pain in my chest near my right breast, and as the day progressed it got worse with a horrible migraine. It began to radiate to the left, and Wednesday I went to Urgent Care because I was scared. My EKG &amp; chest x-ray were clear. Today I feel even worse with migraines, chest pain (that radiates up my neck and around my back), and overall feeling gross and exhausted. My head is what?s bothering me the most along with my joint pain.

                                                Shortly after being given the vaccine the person had an episode of near-syncope where she felt light-headed and was not feeling well.  She has had a history of this occurring in the past after an injection before (unknown if vaccination or other IM injection) and blood draws.  She did not have any loss of conscious, but she became pale and diaphoretic and felt like she could pass out if she would stand consistent with a vasovagal event.  She initially had an elevated pulse at 113 which came down to 65 and her blood pressure was initially 110/60 and then 98/62 on recheck.  Patient was placed supine on a cot and then her legs were elevated to help her symptoms.  She did have some improvement in her symptoms prior to transport to the ER via EMS at her request.

Over the next several days she had migraines, fever, nausea, diarrhea.  She had a very heavy period that was not normal for her.  She was treated twice for presumed UTI (once with macrobid and then with cefuroxime) in the days after the vaccine though cultures ended up negative.  She was referred to me, a hematologist, when she was noted to have a dropping hemoglobin and platelet count.  She appears to have a Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and possibly ITP.  She is feeling a little better but her labs remain abnormal.  Please note this was reported on Pfizer website as well but I have not been contacted.  Guidance would be sincerely appreciated.  My cell phone was provided.

Was with her mom, in case she had an issue. Vaccination without incident.  Kept pt at the vaccination area to observe.  About three minutes after receiving the vaccination, pt started to shake.  Was conversing.  Stated she was warm, so got her a cold bottle of water.  Stated she was dizzy so helped her to the floor to lay down.  She had contractions of her hands, which she stated that they were numb.  She recovered from the dizziness, but then had a panic attack.  Her BP was normal, but her heart rate became elevated.  Had her lay down until she felt better, helping to slow her breathing.  After about 40 minutes,p t felt good enough to sit in the recovery area.  Ensured she had water and some food to help prevent a blood sugar drop.

Outcome of all the events  was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  Coombs negative hemolytic anemia and other events  due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The technician confirmed that patient&#39;s friend was driving her home and the pharmacist cleared her to leave after she spent a total of 30 minutes in the pharmacy.

                                                Arrived at pharmacy for 1:15 PM vaccine appointment. 10 minutes after vaccine injection, I could not swallow. Throat started to close and feel tight like I could not breathe. Tongue swelled and could not feel tongue while biting down. Chest compression on center chest. Around 1:30 PM I told sister to get a nurse and the nurse said due to my allergic reaction I needed to do the EpiPen.  She administered properly in my thigh. About 1:35 PM, symptoms started to go away. Stayed until 1:45 PM and when I left I told the nurse I was leaving. Took 2 Benadryl pills in my car with water.

Felt very restless and sick during night, by the next morning symptoms really sat in.  March 24, 2021: Went to Urgent Care due to fever. Had COVID-19 test (negative). Very close to passing out there (put head between knees and did not). Was sent to emergency room immediately due to heart rate (high 140s-150s. Highest known was 152 BPM). ER performed following: portable chest x-ray, blood tests, urine tests, EKG. Was told results were all normal with the exception of EKG (not told anything about it, form listed as abnormal). Passed out 2x at hospital. Was given one IV rehydration solution and released that night. Symptoms below lasted for several days: Headache Aches Nausea Aggressive shakes Shortness of breath Confusion Dizziness Site pain (also developed bump under arm) Fever - 103.8 (after 2 Advil, 2 Tylenol, 3 ice packs and eating frozen grapes) Heavy sweats Racing heart Restless  March 30, 2021: Still having frequent heart palpitations (they come and go but happen several times during the day. Keep having very high heart rates). Went to doctor. While there, nurse noted irregular heartbeat that sounded like it was ?skipping a beat? and heart rate was also jumping all over the place (high pace, low pace, high, etc.). It was clear something was abnormal. Doctor gave EKG approximately 20 minutes later, EKG looked normal. Was told to come back next morning for blood work and to cut out caffeine.  March 31, 2021: Came in for blood work to check thyroid.  April 6, 2021: Thyroid results were normal. Still having palpitations among other symptoms (see April 12 for more info) so was told to come in. Was given ?work from home? note and referred to cardiologist.  April 12, 2021: Appointment at cardiologist. Still having severe palpitations, occasional dizziness/ lightheadedness, nausea, shortness of breath, exhaustion and chest pain. Heart rate was recorded this day to have gotten up to 139 BPM-- was very high majority of the day. EKG was normal (with exception of high heart rate) but 30 mins later doctor observed high heart rate and abnormal rhythm. Was told to come back in a week and one day for a heart ultrasound and heart monitoring for three days. Still no caffeine intake since 3/30/21. Previous heart rates taken at doctor&#39;s visits over the years for comparison below. Never had any prior heart problems whatsoever:  8/29/18: 70 BPM 9/17/18: 88 BPM 10/17/18: 64 BPM 10/31/18: 73 BPM 1/21/19: 78 BPM Note: At this point, I have missed over a  week and a half of work, and worked from home for over a week. I&#39;m not any better heart wise at all over the course of three weeks post vaccine.

                                                About five to ten minutes after I received my first shot, I started to feel like my throat was closing a little. I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

                                                On April 5th, 2021 I went to the E.D. , for shortness of breath and severe right shoulder pain. While there they got a chest x-ray, ran labs, and did a chest CT. The CT revealed that I had one blood clot in my left lung and two blood clots in my right lung, as well as slight pleural effusion in the right lower lobe. They put me on Xarelto for the next 3-6 months and monthly follow up visits with my primary care provider. I was also given Hydrocodone as need. I experienced extreme pain with breathing and sort of movement for a week and half but currently only have occasional shoulder and back pain usually at the end of the day.

A 22-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), second dose intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 11:30 (lot number: EN6205) as single dose (at the age of 22-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rhinitis allergic. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen; cefuroxime; clarithromycin (MACROBID [CLARITHROMYCIN]); ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE); spironolactone; acetaminophen; origanum minutiflorum oil (OREGANO OIL); tretinoin; ondansetron (ZOFRAN [ONDANSETRON]) and &#34;Olly probiotic/prebiotic&#34;; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2.

The vomiting,  being dizzy and sleeping continued for days.  Went to Urgent Care on April 20, 2021.  They gave me nausea medicine and said I should expect to feel this way for about one week.  The nausea medicine helped with the vomiting, but did not help with being dizzy and sleepy.  Making a trip to the ER for more answers.

I called her the next day but she didn&#39;t answer but I left her a message . I also recommended the she would check with her md on the next day.

I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

While resting during the onset of these symptoms she then felt like she couldn&#39;t breath, experiencing pain in the sides of her chest.  The next symptoms that occurred were angioedema to the face, she described her eyes getting so puffy she couldn&#39;t see.  She also described her skin getting reddened and itching all over.  She took Benadryl at home and started to feel better in about 1 hour.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

                                                I received the COVID19 vaccine on January 22, 2021. I started to have chest tightness and somewhat of a dry cough midday on Monday January 25, which continued until January 27. I started having congestion and runny nose on January 27, so I went and got tested for COVID on the 27. The test came back positive on January 28. On January 28 I had extreme congestion and head pressure, a bad burning sensation from my left sinus that went back to my left 2nd molar, and a runny nose. I had not gone anywhere the week prior due to studying for an exam besides to lab at school twice where everyone was socially distanced and was wearing a mask the whole time. The highest my temperature got was 99.4 with Tylenol on January 28. In addition to this, my husband got covid tested on January 28 to see if he had it, or had given covid to me and his test came back negative. We had not socially distanced and still had physical contact the entire time, and continued not to do so in our house. We have had full contact the entire time because he is working from home and most of my school is online, and he got tested again on January 30 and came back negative again. If somehow I got covid from school in a short amount of time with everyone wearing a mask, how would he not get covid from me after a full week of exposure unless I was not contagious, which makes me think I somehow got it from the vaccine. I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, as I got the shingles when I was 4 as a direct result from the first chickenpox vaccine.

                                                After being vaccinated and while waiting in the observation area, I began to feel hot and light headed. I fainted about 15 minutes after sitting down in the waiting area and upon fainting hit my head on the floor. I regained consciousness while laying on the floor getting my vitals taken by staff. Because of the minor head injury and proximity to getting the vaccine, I accepted being taken to the ER.

                                                29 minutes after being given the vaccine my tongue started itching and swelled up a bit, my mouth felt dry, my face became a bit reddened, puffy, and itchy, my throat began to swell a bit and my chest felt tight, giving me some discomfort when it came to breathing. I let the nurses who were keeping an eye on those waiting for 15/30 minutes know that I was having a reaction. I waited 1 more minute, and when my throat felt tighter and I had a bit more difficulty breathing, I took 1 Benadryl tablet, and waited 2 minutes, and when the symptoms were still worsening slowly, I took a second Benadryl tablet and after a few minutes my symptoms started to go away.  I waited another 10 minutes and then went home when it seemed that my symptoms were going away.  At 6:45pm on 2/21/2021 my throat and chest started feeling tight again and gave me mild breathing discomfort, so I took another Benadryl tablet, a few minutes later my face began to itchy and my mouth felt dry and my tongue felt a bit swollen, whereupon I took a second Benadryl tablet at 6:56pm, and then felt a wave of nausea.  At 6:59pm, the feeling of tightness had not abated, but also hadn&#39;t worsened noticeably, and the itching feeling began to spread from my face to my ears and down my neck.  At 7:04pm the tightness of my throat and chest began to increase some, and I started to feel some anxiety.  At 7:11pm I inhaled two puffs from an albuterol inhaler used for treating asthma as my throat and chest were continuing to slowly get tighter.  At 7:26pm I still felt itchy and my throat and chest still felt tight, but it wasn&#39;t noticeably worse.  At 7:35pm, my throat began to feel tight enough to give me noticeable discomfort while breathing and for me to make a slight wheezing sound while breathing, and my tongue felt like it swelled a bit more, and my mouth still felt dry.  At 7:51pm the Benadryl made me feel sleepy, but had no effect on my itchy skin or tightness of throat or chest.  8:00pm, my throat and chest felt tighter and I started having some difficulty swallowing and I felt very warm.  8:05pm, I had a lot of difficulty swallowing and had trouble breathing, so I went to the Emergency Room and was given an Epinephrine shot and sent home after an hour of observation.

                                                After my first dose, I had a sore arm for a few days. After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

Uncertain about time of loss of consciousness. Other symptoms included pallor, fast heart rate, sweating, nausea and loss of bladder function. No treatment required, seen in the ED and recovered without treatment.   Because she was driving a car at the time, she rear-ended the car in front of her and the airbags deployed. Underwent evaluation for motor vehicle accident as well in the ED with no injuries noted.

Immunizer notified me/pharmacist of patient&#39;s history and staff was informed to watch her for any adverse events.  5-10 minutes later patient walked up to counsel window and notified pharmacist she was going to faint.  I asked her to please return to her seat and immediately a technician and I went out and assisted her to a chair.  We provided a bottle of water and advised her to sip some.  After a few more minutes she passed out in the chair.  At that point we called 911.  The operator advised us to lay her flat.  We moved her into the training room and waited for EMT to arrive.  They arrived a few minutes later.  At that point she was beginning to come around.  I left to return to pharmacy as she was being cared for.  20 minutes later the EMT consulted me and patient vitals were good and she was feeling much better and refused to be transported to hospital.  I signed off their form as a witness of her refusal.

This was presumably because I also have a needle phobia but I did almost faint and had to have on site EMT asses condition and observe for 30 minutes. At 4 pm one hour after injection face felt itchy and irritated and noticed hives on neck and jawline. Immediately administered benadryl 50 mg which made the hives subside.

Patient received vaccine and about one minute later the patient passed out and fell forward. I was able to catch her and lower to the ground safely. I called for pharmacist on duty to assist in the care of the patient. Less than a minute after the patient passed out she was awake and alert.  The patient was asked multiple times if she needed to go to the hospital and asked if she was okay to drive home.  She insisted that she faints frequently from vaccines and denied any further care.  She stayed in the waiting area while being checked on several times. The patient left after she said she was &#34;100% good.&#34; She thanked us for taking care of her and apologized for what happened.

Received 2nd covid vaccination last week- mild reaction with fever thereafter.  She had w/u in the ED including an EKG with inferior and septal TWI and trop of 1.61.  CTA chest was negative.  She was admitted.  After admit, troponin trended up (1.61--3.71--4.93).  CRP 49.1, ESR 21.   Echo showed apex hypokinesis so with TWI on EKG and elevated trop, cardiology elected for LHC.  This was normal.  Cardiac MRI showed myopericarditis. She was started on high dose ASA, colchicine and bblocker for this.  Likely viral etiology (Covid, Resp 4 plex negative).  Trop trended down on 4/13 (CRP still rising).  Cardiology was ok with discharge.  Will need 2 weeks of ASA and 3 months of colchicine.  No strenuous activities for that time frame.  She is getting her Masters in music/violin and did not need a return to school note.   Feeling somewhat better at discharge- rated pain 6/10.    Internal Medicine followup in 1 week Cardiology followup in 2 months

                                                I noticed a petechia rash on my legs the day after I received the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, April 06, 2021, I noticed the rash spreading around my chest area, neck area, thighs, and arms as the following days progressed. On Friday, April 09, 2021, I made an appointment at the Student Health Center where I was seen by clinician,  who requested I get blood labs done. After results showed that my platelet count was 30,000, she immediately referred me to the ER at Hospital. She informed that it was an adverse side effect to my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she also informed me that it was a very rare instance and there are cases of other individuals that this has also happened to. Dr. informed me my situation was extremely dangerous and could have potentially been fatal if I had not decided to seek medical attention. I was admitted into the  Hospital on April 09, and was discharged on Monday, April 12, 2021. While I was in the hospital, that Friday 04/09 I received a blood transfusion for my low platelet count, it did not show much improvement, I was diagnosed with ITP by clinician  who is a clinician within the Hematology and Oncology department.  Dr. also informed me that this seemed to be an adverse side effect to the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine, Dr.then recommended I receive steroids for 4 consecutive days to increase my platelet count. The date of my discharge 04/12, my platelet count was 20,000 which is still considered extremely low but due to steroids that were given to me for 4 days, Dr.agreed that this would hopefully increase my platelet count.

I left work around 3 pm on 04/22/2021 with major bodyaches and extreme fatigue. Around 4 pm, I felt extremely itchy and found hives all over my arms, legs, above the injection site, cheeks, and butt. All my hives seemed to be worse on my right hand side, the side I received both vaccines in. After taking 2 Benadryl around 4:30 and taking a cold shower, I could feel the cold water turning warm from running off my hives when hitting my feet. No signs of fever. Shortly thereafter, I used Hydrocortisone cream and they left. At 6:30 am I woke up covered again, by 2pm 04/23 they are off and on.

Feeling of swelling in throat/difficulty swallowing lasted until about 4 hours after vaccine was given, and was more intense after second dose, though not enough to seek medical attention.  In addition, after the second dose, a feeling of prickling/heat on skin, which began within 1-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and lasted for about 5 minutes after symptoms began.   No respiratory effects. No other symptoms which resembled an allergic reaction (itchy mouth, rash, adrenaline rush, etc.)

A 23-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 21Apr2021 08:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 23 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen. The patient previously took septra and experienced allergies (known allergies); and first dose of BNT162B2 on 31Mar2021 08:45 at right arm for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine in four weeks. On 22Apr2021, the patient had a fever of up to 103.5 and was down to around 102 by the time of the incident (around 4:00). The patient woke up and was standing for about 3 minutes to refill water when she got super nauseous. She was making her way to the bathroom to throw up, and the next thing she knew she was on the floor. The patient was not sure how long she was passed out for though she had no reason to believe it was long. She tried to sit up, but she really wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she laid back down and closed her eyes for a bit. Then she got super hot and sweaty. Once that passed (maybe a few more minutes), she was able to check her temperature and she was down to around 101 and was able to get back to bed. No treatment for the events. No COVID prior vaccination. The patient had not been COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in Apr2021.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                At 2 AM I woke up with a tight and heavy chest. It was difficult to breathe and I used an oximeter to check my O2, which showed 99% saturation. I checked my temperature but that was normal, around 97 F. I tried different positions to make breathing easier but the pressure would not lift. Around 3 AM I used my (expired) inhaler. Almost immediately I could feel my chest getting lighter. I used my inhaler again around 10 am. The chest tightness did not lift a noticable amount until around 2 PM. By 5 PM all tightness had subsided.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 17Apr2021 (Lot Number: EW0162) (at the age of 23-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and diagnosed at age 2, allergy and allergy to bull dogs. Concomitant medications included budesonid taken for allergy, start and stop date were not reported; formoterol fumarate dihydrate taken for allergy, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced her lungs felt swollen in Apr2021, the back of her tongue felt numb/developed a numb tongue on 17Apr2021, throat was itchy then sore/her throat was sore and itchy on 17Apr2021, chest pain on 17Apr2021, not quite normal breathing/uncomfortable breathing/heavy breathing that was more of an irregular breathing/out of breath walking up the steps on 17Apr2021 and fatigue on 17Apr2021. A family member had some reaction to the first pfizer covid-19 vaccine. Wanted to know where can she find information to determine if the second vaccine shot is safe. 40 minutes from the time of the injection the back of her tongue felt numb and her throat was itchy then sore. About 40 minutes after that those symptoms went away. Later in the day she had chest pain and not quite normal breathing. After using her asthma inhaler twice in a short time this dissapated. Fatigue remained for about a week. Her daughter was prescribed Metronidazole 500mg (she initially thought it was penicillin) and the packaging information of the antibiotic says not to receive any vaccines. She was scheduled for her second dose next Tuesday (18May2021) and wanted to know if it would this be applicable to the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine. Mother calling on behalf of daughter who received the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine on 17Apr2021. She was told to wait 30 minutes after the vaccine and was okay, however after 40 minutes after the vaccine she developed a numb tongue, her throat was sore and itchy. This subsided within about 30 minutes (also reported as 40 minutes). About 4 hours after the vaccine she developed chest pain and uncomfortable breathing. Her daughter states her lungs felt swollen, and was out of breath walking up the steps. She did use her AuviQ and albuterol inhaler and the first dose of AuviQ didn&#39;t work so she repeated it and it helped. She called the doctor and used her peak flow meter and the doctor on call stated that her reading was okay and did not need further medical attention. After that evening those side effects went away. Caller has a past medical history of asthma and allergies to bulldogs. If she was even around someone who has been near a bull dog she will develop chest symptoms. Mother spoke with CDC and they told her as long as her daughter didn&#39;t go to the ER it was okay for her to receive the vaccine and wanted to know if she get her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine. She is scheduled to receive it next Tuesday (18May2021). Her doctor said that some people react to the polyethylene glycol and want to know if she could get tested for that. After the patient received the vaccine, her tongue was numb and her throat was sore and itchy but it went away. This started 40 minutes after the patient received the vaccine. 4 hours after the patient received the vaccine, she had chest pain and heavy breathing. The caller is nervous because the patient has only had this chest pain during a severe allergic reaction in the past. The patient do about the second dose. The patient was also prescribed an antibiotic this week and the antibiotic paperwork said not to have any vaccines while taking that product. The patient is due for the second dose of the vaccine this week, is it okay to get because she will still be on the penicillin. This event happened after receiving the first dose of the vaccine on 17Apr2021. The patient also had fatigue for a week. The patient had the heavy breathing that was more of an irregular breathing. The patient&#39;s lungs felt swollen, it felt like there was weight on her chest, it was uncomfortable breathing. The caller felt out of breath walking up the steps. The caller used her inhaler twice. The patient underwent lab test included investigations: the on call doctor had the patient do the peak flow meter and it was fine, over 550 on 17Apr2021. No more information was available. The doctor also had the patient press her chest to see if there was pain when she touched it and there was not so the on call doctor felt comfortable not making the patient go to the emergency room. Caller reports that her daughter received her first vaccine dose on 17Apr2021 and afterwards experienced a severe reaction with symptoms including, tongue swelling, sore throat, and Chest pain. Caller reported that it didn&#39;t getm severe enough for her to need an Epi pen. Caller reports that they have an appointment to see her doctor as well, for further discussion. She calls today to ask if symptoms with the second dose are expected to be worse than they were with the first shot and timing of the second dose. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID- 19 infection. Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision. The outcome of the event her lungs felt swollen was unknown, the event fatigue was recovered in Apr2021, the other events was recovered on 17Apr2021.

Symptoms in leg started a few days prior to admittance. Was put on Heparin via shot and then IV. Clotting grew worse overnight with leg swelling, leading to an inability to walk. After increased elevation leg improved and was put on an oral dose of Eliquis. Was put on oxygen in the ICU and took portable oxygen home when discharged on 5/17.   Also tested positive for strep 4/11.  Was advised to file a report by my PCP.

                                                Pt had a scheduled appt at 1235 pm for her 2nd dose of pfizer covid vaccine on 6/4/21 at our store .  Pt stated that she had some &#34;chest tightness&#34; shortly after the first dose (~4/24/21). After reviewing VAR filled out by patient today, I consulted with pt about having a reaction to the first dose.  Pt stated that EMS observed her for 30 minutes after the 1st vaccination and patient self-reports that she recovered without the use of an epi pen (pt does carry an epipen on her at all times) within that 30 minute window and was allowed to leave.  We administered 2nd dose with the understanding that patient recovered from 1st dose with no breathing difficulties or swelling of tongue or throat (just chest tightness as reported by pt).   After administering the second dose today, Pt began to show signs of an allergic reaction ~ 5 minutes after administration  and we administered the epi-pen and  911 was called.  Observed that pt vomited and complained of chest tightness, tight throat , difficulty breathing and being hot and &#34;sleepy&#34; after second shot.  Pt appeared to be alert and oriented and was sitting in a chair.  EMS arrived and pt is now under their care.  We dont know the lot number of the 1st covid vaccination but the lot used today was EW0167 with an expiration of 8/31/21.

                                                4/30 - Five minutes after the vaccine, I passed out. I felt uncontrollably shaky and my vision went white. I was not anxious prior to getting the vaccine and felt terror afterwards. 5/1 - I developed severe depression and suicidal ideation. I reported to those around me that I did not feel safe. I am not diagnosed with depression and did not experience depression prior to the vaccine. I felt suicidal, completely hopeless, anxious, and was uncontrollably bursting into tears without an identifiable trigger. 5/2 - I developed shooting pain in my legs and arms. It felt like a pulsating, stabbing pain that throbbed. It was unlike any pain I had experienced ever before. 5/3 - I developed a metallic taste in my mouth that could not be washed away with water or food. It was extremely noticeable. 5/4  - My period came a week early. I have been on birth control for seven years and have never experienced any changes in my menstrual cycle. I made no other lifestyle or health changes other than the vaccine. The period was extremely heavy, full of clots, and was painful. It lasted longer than usual, until about 5/9. 5/16 - I developed another period only a week after the first period. This period was equally as heavy and long-lasting. It remained until about 5/21.  Following the vaccine, I began suffering from heart palpitations, leg cramps, and random pains. I did not experience these prior to the vaccine. I cannot identify the date these symptoms began, but it was within the first week of taking the vaccine.

                                                Patient ,, was vaccinated at approximately 2:15pm today at  Vaccine Clinic. While in the observation area post-vaccine, patient lost consciousness at approximately 2:20pm for 60-90 seconds. Patient was not nervous, did not feel dizzy, nauseous, or feel she had an allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient is an employee of  Environmental and was accompanied by a co-worker.  PA  evaluated the patient, initial pulse rate was 104, a few minutes later was 87, then rose again to 97.BP was 125/78. Patient reported feeling weak and cold, has not eaten or had anything to drink today except a cup of coffee and cookies in the morning. PA assessed the patient vasovagaled due to dehydration, not due to a reaction from the vaccine. Patient drank 3 small bottles of water, ate saltine crackers and a granola bar.   EMS was called and we attempted to cancel as the nurse was going to take the patient to  ED, but EMS arrived on site already, assessed the patient and the patient refused to go to the ED by nurse or EMS.  Patient was observed until 3:12pm and went home in an Uber.   Patient info:   Appointment #D11KA5Q

Called 911 transported to ER. Monitored cardiac unit for 24 hours, HA. Two months of HAs. I went home and I don&#39;t recall exact how everything transpired.  I do remember they wanted follow up with PCP.  I developed blood clots in R arm, platelets were high since getting vaccinated.  *originally diagnosed with colitis but now diagnosed with Chrohns disease.  1/16 I did have a personal injury in a parking lot that exacerbated the issues, I was vaccinated after.  *In transition with new doctors now and have not really discussed the potential of this being caused by vaccine, focused more on pain management.  **before this vaccine, I was relatively healthy before, no issues.

                                                About three days after vaccine, I started bleeding and getting blood clots. I went to ER to make sure I wasn&#39;t miscarrying. I wasn&#39;t that day. Everything looked okay. Baby was measuring much smaller than it should be. I kept bleeding lightly for a couple of days. Tuesday I was bleeding heavily - I went to ER again. Hormone levels - were going up but not as they should be. From Tuesday - Friday, I didn&#39;t bleed. I started bleeding on Saturday again. And I&#39;m still bleeding. I called my OB today and she is going to call me back in the morning to let me know what to do. I was last seen on Friday at ER again.   Pregnancy History - One other pregnancy - carried twins fine. Estimated date of delivery for this pregnancy - January 17, 2022.

Tingling sensation is still present to this day 2 months after first vaccination however it comes and goes, especially present under periods of stress which never happened before until I received the vaccine. I haven?t not received the second dose because I?m too scared I will completely lose feeling in my body and it will never returner I will develop Guillian-Barre syndrome as a result.

                                                I felt very fatigued starting around 6pm. Severe chills began around 9pm, followed by a fever. The fever went from 100.1 to 102.2 over the course of about an hour (11:30pm-12:30pm), at which time I took 400mg of ibuprofen. The fever was 102.1 thirty minutes after taking the ibuprofen. Along with the fever I experienced tachycardia, body and muscle aches, and moderate to severe deltoid pain at the injection site. I believe the fever broke around 3:00am. The fatigue and body aches lasted about 24 hours since they began, but the majority  of the rest of my symptoms were gone after the fever. The arm pain at injection site was noticeable and painful for about 72 hours before subsiding.

                                                Third day after receiving the vaccine I have been continuously experiencing sparatic and sharp pains mainly in my chest but also in my stomach and occasionally my back. It mainly shows up in my chest. Sharp and achey pains all in different spots at different times. This has been occurring now for 6 days and has not gotten better with time or any medicine I?ve been instructed to take by physician. Sometimes it throbs, sometimes it aches, sometimes it?s sharp and sudden. There is no consistency other than how painful it is. The pain has gotten more intense this evening 1/19/21. I have not experienced more than a half hour without any pain. It has been ongoing since 1/13/21. I woke up last night at 2:45am with a throbbing pain on the left side of my chest.

The chest tightness continued until 1/23.  It was not a constant pain, but sometimes when I would move a certain way, my chest would hurt. The spot that hurt is right in the middle of my chest. It got worse when I would exercise and breathe heavily. The chest pain continued to stop and come back for several weeks. The night after I received the vaccine, I felt dizzy and felt as if I would pass out, but did not. This only happened one time and was better when I woke up the next morning.   The weekend after I got the vaccine, I was worried I might have covid, so I got tested for covid, but the results came back negative.

The nurse placed ice packs on the back of my neck to cool down. She continually monitored my vital signs. Upon leaving my blood pressure was still elevated, but improved.

                                                At around 7PM 01/29/2021, I was at the store to get groceries when walking around the store became difficult due to being out of breathe. When I got home the body aches got worse and I started getting severe chills and could not stop shaking. That night was difficult to sleep because of the pain I was in. When I woke up the next day, 01/30/2021, I was dizzy, severe fatigue, had severe migraines, I could not breathe when standing up and moving around, my heart was racing, and it felt like I had a sun burn all over my body.

                                                Patient was given second dose.  30 minutes later she sat down on a couch and was breathing short and shallow.  She was not responsive and mildly shaking.  I gave her an Epipen shot and in less than a minute she was a wake and feeling much better.  She drank some water.  911 was not called because her mother was a nurse and was nearby.  She came and picked her up and took her to a doctor.  I checked on the patient this afternoon and she is feeling fine other than feeling tired.  She has a medical history of weight loss surgery and not dieting properly.  The administrator of the home  said she has a history of not feeling well and almost fainting from not eating properly after her weight loss surgery.

My heart rate was consistently in the 110s-120s and my blood pressure was in the 100s/40s. My highest temperature was 103.5. My fiancé is a nurse who took care of me at home. I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen for the aches and fever. I slept the majority of each day and was unable to perform my activities of daily life or exercise. I lost my appetite for about 1 week. I had no sense of taste in Sunday, which slowly returned over the next week. I was concerned about the loss of taste so I scheduled a COVID-19 swab which came back negative on 1/11.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I am now 30 weeks pregnant and the reason I went to see my hematologist is because my platelets dropped. I had lab work done the week of 02-22-2021 through 02-26-2021. I also had soreness at the injection site and a palpable lymph node under my armpit that was present for 24 hours then it resolved. I will also be receiving treatment with IV, IG and prednisone medication starting this week of 03-15-2021 through       03-19-2021.

                                                7 AM  (about 21 hours after I received the second dose) I woke up having the most intense nausea I have ever experienced. I went to my kitchen to get water and passed out, dropping the glass I was in the process of getting from the cabinet, and I crashed. I felt so horrible I just tried to get back to my bed at that point without getting water. I passed out again trying to get back to my bed, bruising my right knee and my ribs.  One the most horrible feelings I have experienced. I stayed on the floor for a bit recovering the second spell. My sister heard the commotion and quickly brought me water and Tylenol.  My head felt full of pressure that I couldn?t get rid of by holding my nose and blowing. Eventually that went away. I stayed in bed for the rest of the day drinking water and Gatorade. I felt like I had an intense flu for the remainder of the day with chills and fever. The following day I needed more sleep but felt better.  Now today, Saturday I feel better, but I still feel shocked at how intense my body?s reaction was to the second dose.

                                                The patient received the Pfizer vaccine, given by HCP. After the vaccine, the patient felt a little anxious with increased heart rate so she asked HCP for a bottle of water. HCP went to get the water and informed the pharmacist on duty. Both pharmacist and HCP came back to the patient. She got the bottle and was about to open the bottle, but closed her eyes  and started shaking like having a seizure and passed out. She came back right after passing out but didn&#39;t know what happened. She then started shaking again for a few seconds but didn&#39;t pass out. Everything happened so quickly when she remained sitting on the chair. We called 911 and paramedics came. She mentioned that the seizure happened to her before, maybe once or twice a year. When paramedics came, they checked her blood pressure and it was ok. We asked her and she wanted to come to the hospital to check out to make sure that she is ok.

I put on my Apple watch and to check my heart rate and it was 140 beats per minute. The highest it went up to was 175 beats per minute. I was not feeling anxious or having an anxiety attack so I&#39;m not sure what caused this. I have had anxiety attacks in the past, but I&#39;ve never felt my heart pound and race like that.  My heart rate went down to 115 - 130 beats per minute. At around 11 am when  my heart rate was still not going down, I went to the Urgent Care where I was referred to go to the Emergency Room.

                                                4/4: Woke up Easter Sunday with the following symptoms: sweats, chills, uncontrollable shaking, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Went to Urgent Care, but it was closed for the holiday, so instead went to ER. See Item 19 for details. I was discharged within an hour because there was nothing seriously wrong with me, doctor wrote it off as a stomach bug and ordered me to rest and hydrate.  4/4 - 4/10: Virtually every day for this week went the exact same. I would wake up between 6-7am, feel nauseous, weak, no appetite, and shaking. Walking around my apartment would leave me utterly exhausted. I would nap from 9am-12pm, then again from 2-4pm. Ate very little, drank water and sports drinks when awake. Breathing was still shaky. Occasional diarrhea.  4/10: Although slightly less ill than the previous 6 days, I still felt weak, shaky, and exhausted. I went back to Urgent Care this time, and the doctor examined me. She noted my left ear was very inflamed and suspected an ear infection. She prescribed me a week of amoxycilin and told me to rest and eat bland foods.  4/12: After 2 days on the antibiotics, some of my symptoms cleared. I was no longer shaking or having shortness of breath, and although still tired, I did not sleep for half the day as I had the previous week. My appetite was not fully there yet, and in the mornings of this week I would wake up feeling nauseous for about 2 hours. On this day 4/12 my period also started, which is unusual. It was not due to start until around April 17th. My period is very regular and light due to being on birth control, so I consider this abnormal. The flow was also very heavy.   4/17: Heavy flow of my period slows significantly and is now just a slight pink/brown color. I only need a liner to contain it. This is also my last day of antibiotics, so I buy a probiotic supplement in the hopes that it will help settle my gut.  4/17-present (4/20): The morning nausea and lack of appetite are still present despite being off the antibiotics. Occasional discomfort in abdomen/chest. Unexplained muscle soreness in hips, legs, back, and chest. My bowel movement schedule has also completely changed. Normally I do not experience a bowel movement until late morning, after 10am. But for the past 2 weeks I have been woken up around 5:30am with a sudden urge. At the beginning of my illness it was diarrhea but now it has transitioned to slightly more solid feces. It is not really diarrhea anymore.

PA to the students side immediately and student was breathing but not alert.  Student aroused easily but 9-1-1 was called as a precaution due to student hitting head. Student was observed but was not transported via EMS. No meds were given and he was able to ambulate out to the clinic without issues after the episode.

                                                Bloody nose, happened after I sneezed after I woke up from a nap, pretty heavy blood flow and didn?t stop, started coming out of both nostrils. The left nosebleed kept going but the right nose bleed stopped after a little while. Kept on bleeding for maybe 8 to 10 minutes as I cooked lunch, I plugged the nostril with a paper towel until it clotted three or four times but the flow still didn?t stop. I used to have nose bleeds frequently when I was a young child but don?t really have them often anymore. After plugging it with a paper towel was not successful, I tried pinching my nose bridge and leaning forward which worked a little bit better but I could tell that the flow hadn?t stopped because the blood and the bloody mucus would collect in my throat and I had to spit it out. I applied a Vaseline like jelly balm in order to moisturize the skin in my nostrils. About maybe around half an hour after my nose bleed started the flow has abated and I am able to do my tasks without having to spit out the bloody clotted mucus that slides into my mouth and throat. I think I have only had a few nose bleeds that I can remember that were as bad as this, probably only two or three. I ate lunch and did not notice a change in my perception of taste. Currently experiencing a very mild headache.

I also began having a severe auto immune flare up with body pains in my legs, back, and stomach immobilizing me with generalized weakness.

Immediately after vaccination, the patient had a vasovagal episode with syncope. Upon my arrival, the patient was alert and had been placed in a supine position with legs elevated. The patient was taking PO hydration and feeling much improved. Per the patient, this is routine for them with vaccination. Plan: Moderate vasovagal episode with syncope, which is common for the patient. We discussed future compensatory measures to avoid these events. The patient was at baseline at discharge and returned home with a partner as the driver.

She experienced Tightening, heating up, swelling of throat and chest within 10 minutes of vaccine administration, also reported as at 14:15. They called the Paramedics, who gave her Benadryl injection when they picked her up from the site where she received her vaccination, which was a drug store. She was then transported to the emergency department. She was hospitalized and treated with Benadryl injection for the Tightening, heating up, swelling of throat and chest. She was monitored for 3-4 hours, and her symptoms were not worsening and she was able to leave the hospital. Ever since, this is the 9th day, everyday she had severe shortness of breath. She had no wheezing. Her chest clenches. It scared her so she had gone to the Emergency Department 2 more times for it. She had gone there 3 times in total. She had been to the Emergency Room a few times and saw doctors there. Her throat closing stopped later that evening and had come back about 4 times. Since then, she was not sure if it was just the sensation of the throat closing because it is coupled with shortness of breath. She had the sensation of throat closing about 4 times. She was short of breath every day since receiving the vaccine and up to 4 times each day. Sometimes it was worse than others. She had it while on the call (19Apr2021) and rated it 4/10. On 14Apr2021 she went to the Emergency Department in the middle of the night. She rated that episode as 9/10. Episodes of symptoms had been ongoing and reoccurring since the day of vaccine administration. She had a COVID-19 test post vaccination in Apr2021 (unknown results). The outcome of  Tightening/ Chest tightness, heating up, swelling of throat and chest, throat closing and severe shortness of breath was not recovered.

I frequently donate plasma. I had no side effects from the shot up until that point. Immediately after donating, I got in my car and looked down to see that my needle injection site from donating was pouring out an excessive amount of blood. I lost all vision and the employees helped to rebandage the site and put pressure. That had never happened before after donating. It seemed that my blood failed to clot.

A 24-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0173, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 01May2021 18:00 (at the age of 24 years old) as first dose, single for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were no other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. On 01May2021 18:00, patient immediately started sweating after getting the shot then passed out within a couple minutes. Pharmacist told the patient that she turned blue and they injected her with Epipen. Patient woke up after and felt fine. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The events were reported as serious medically significant. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from the events reported on an unspecified date in May2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events loss of consciousness, hyperhidrosis and skin discolouration cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                So at around 9pm the evening of my shot, I started feeling feverish so I went to the other room to get my temperature and while I was waiting for my temperature to be recorded, I started to feel lightheaded and I called out for help. I woke up on the floor, I woke up to my roommate and boyfriend standing over me. They were on the phone with 9-1-1. I was out for about a minute and unresponsive. According to them, my arm was flailing and seizure-ish. I went to the ER, I was taken by EMS services. They gave me fluids and ran bloodwork and monitored me. They sent me home, I did have another episode of what I think was an episode of memory loss/passed out. I just remembered waking up in a room alone. I was at the ER for about 4-5 hours. They gave me IV fluids and I don&#39;t remember what else, some sort of supplement. It was magnesium oxide they gave me. When I left the ER I was really exhausted, and feverish and gross and I was pretty sick for the remaining two days. I didn&#39;t sleep well that night, I had a fever the following day and into the second day upon returning home as well.

                                                I got the vaccine some time in the night when i was taking a shower i noticed arm soreness. when i went to bed around 11pm from the top of my shoulder down to my finger tips it was swollen and had arm pain. I tried to go to bed and about 30 minutes later i went to get up to grab some advil. I checked in the mirror to see if there was redness and got light headed. Next thing i know i passed out. I woke up on the floor and a big pool of blood i dont know how long i was out for. I had a nose bleed and had a bruise on my head, I could leave the bath room because i was shaking so bad and couldnt use any force to get up. After 45 mins that i went to my room and called my mom who is a physican i sat on the floor for 3 or 4 hours until i could get the nose bleed to stop. I ended up then getting into bed and the shacking had stopped after 800 mg of advil. I checked my pupils for signs of cuncussion. the 1/25 i had my first appointment and we checked to see if i broke my nose. after that the next days they did see signs of concussion with sleeping 20 hours a day and blurry vision. I went back to  med center to get an mri and eeg to see about the concussion because they were worried since i didnt know how long i was out for. They also sent me to a concussion specialist. I had follow up care about the concussion for a month or so.  For about a week floowing the vaccine i was taking 800mg 3times a day for the tremor&#39;s and fever

A 24-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 11May2021 at 14:45 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was taking unspecified birth control medication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was on her second week of completing the vaccine. The patient reported that on Thursday night, 20May2021, she was just laying down on her couch watching Netflix with her laptop on her lap, her leg fell asleep but she didn&#39;t think anything of it because once she started walking around it went back fine. However, on 21May2021, Friday morning, she was having serious pain in her left thigh. She believed it was a muscle strain. The patient did a cold compress, warm bath and took Tylenol from Friday to Saturday. She thought it got better but by 23May2021, Sunday night, she was incapable of walking on her own and needed assistance just to go to the bathroom. On 24May2021, she went to Urgent Care and they stated that she may have a blood clot so she went to the ER (Emergency Room). While at the ER they said she had a massive blood clot from her thigh to her ankle. She would need a procedure done to remove it and was later admitted into the hospital and scheduled for the procedure. Blood thinners and suctioning out the blood clot was done as treatment. The patient been tested for COVID-19 (nasal swab) on 24May2021 with a result of negative. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                4 days after my second dose, I started feeling chest tightness and slight pain, which increased in severity over the next couple of days. Late on April 11, 2021, I went to the ER because my heart was racing and my chest pain had become much worse. They ran several tests, and I was admitted into the hospital for two nights and diagnosed with  pericarditis. The troponin levels in my blood were very high, which made the doctors think I had myocarditis, but an echocardiogram revealed no inflammation of my heart. I?m on an 8-week course treatment of colchicine, and was taking ibuprofen and omeprazole for 5 weeks.

Around 30 hours later I started to have severe chest pain. It was hard to breathe and for a few hours I was worried I was going to have a heart attack. I put on my Apple Watch to record my heart rate and it was jumping from the 70?s to the 115?s just laying in bed. Now after reading that I am not the only one who had severe chest pain I am worried about any long lasting effects since I decided not to go to the doctor for these chest pains.

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; brand: Pfizer Biotech; lot number: EL0142) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 30Dec2020 at 12:45 PM at a single dose (dose number: 1) for COVID-19 immunization. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was workplace clinic. Medical history included premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). No known allergies (no allergies to medications, food, or other products). The patient was not pregnant. No other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced adverse events included blood pressure dropped to 70/50, heart rate went up to 140, whole body got cold and tingly and she got tunnel vision and almost passed out. The events all started on 30Dec2020 at 12:45 PM. The events were reported as non-serious. No treatment received for events. The outcome of events was resolving. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tunnel vision with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

On 1/1 the itching started spreading throughout my body. I have continuously been itching since 12/31. The itching is all over my scalp, arms, hands, back, and legs. I have recently developed a pain/pressure in the back of my head, that feels like I have smacked it against a wall. I have also recently developed pain in my chest. I have seen my PCP, dermatologist, and ED drs and no one can find a route cause for my reaction.

                                                Immediately got redness of injection site feeling of nausea. Needed to take my mask off to get fresh air.  Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

A 25-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced on 04Jan2021 felt unwell, tired, stomach upset (it continued all week) and on 07Jan2021 tachycardia and shortness of breath. Clinical course: she was feeling very like short of breath and her heart racing, had elevated blood pressure 165/90, usually it was normal. The patient was sent to the emergency room (ER) and got worked up, she had a complete blood panel, everything came back normal; she had a chest X-Ray and 2 bags of fluid, then the patient was discharged. The patient outcome of the events was recovered.   The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I then called him back 4 minutes later and failed to form words, and also could not type words. I felt like I was going to faint and have no recollection of 10 minutes during that time. I had to leave work to go to the emergency room.  I had a massive headache for 3 days following my TIA.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

                                                Was driving home after waiting my 15 minutes. Throat started to close up, tingling sensation throughout entire body, rush of heat, dizziness, increased heart rate. Made it back to the site (closest medical professionals near me) where my throat still felt swollen but I could breathe. Chest hurt and was still dizzy. Was given 50mg Benadryl &amp; 20mg Pepsid. It seemed to come and go in waves but I still went to the ER. ER doc said what he saw I was experiencing was anxiety. Pharmacist who had been with me the whole time could tell that my neck and throat had been swollen but had gone down with the Benadryl. ER administered anti nausea meds and a steroid shot. Also prescribed steroids for a few days. Received the shot at 6:45, initial reaction occurred around 7:10, went to the ER around 8:45

                                                Five minutes after vaccine, I started having trouble breathing. Thought it was anxiety attack but I didn&#39;t feel anxious. I felt light headed and I don&#39;t get that with my panic attacks; At 15 minutes, my heart was beating really fast. They checked my vitals - pulse and BP was elevated. Pulse is over 130 and normally when I have an anxiety attack it doesn&#39;t go above 110. Went to the  ER . The breathing felt better after thirty min after being in ER and Blood pressure 1-2 hours later went down. No treatment. After about two weeks I saw my primary care doctor for check up.

The day prior to testing positive I had been notified that I had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive. I did not have any symptoms when I tested positive on 12/28/20 except for a headache later that night. The next day I felt fatigued and had nasal congestion. On 12/30/20, i noticed that I had lost my sense of smell and my sense of taste was altered. I also felt mild chest tightness however my o2 sats remained above 95%. The congestion and fatigue only lasted for two days and my sense of smell and taste had come back by 1/1/21. The chest tightness has persisted even now after testing negative but has diminished over time and occurs less frequently.

A non-pregnant 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3246), intramuscular in left arm, on 15Jan2021 at 14:15, at 0.3 mL, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amfetamine aspartate monohydrate/ amfetamine sulfate/ dexamfetamine saccharate/ dexamfetamine sulfate (MYDAYIS), buspirone hydrochloride (BUSPAR), and ethinylestradiol/ norethisterone acetate (MICROGESTIN). The patient previously took cefotaxime sodium (OMNICEF) and amoxicillin sodium/clavulanate potassium (AUGMENTIN) and experienced allergies to both drugs. The patient worked on a COVID-19 study. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. On 18Jan2021 at 03:00 AM, the patient had a pounding heart rate beginning two days after vaccination and had felt faint. The patient received her first dose on Friday and then last night (3 AM; also reported as 2-3 AM) she started having rapid heart rate like it was pounding out of her chest. It woke her up in the middle of the night around 2-3 AM so it was this morning around 2-3 AM. The patient can still feel like her heart is pounding out of her chest, but it is improved a little bit since it began. It is a little better now but is still persistent. No treatment was given for the adverse events. The patient was not sure if that is something that has been reported before. She did not know what to do but she wanted to try to find out if it was because of the vaccine. The patient did report it online already, she did the event reporting, but she would be happy answer more questions. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination. The patient was recovering from the events

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 25-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number=EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at site of right arm on 20Jan2021 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medication included vitamin D3 and iron (SLOW RELEASE IRON) and daily multivitamin. Within minutes of receiving the dose on 20Jan2021 at 09:45 AM, dizziness, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, flushed, weakness, and shakiness. About an hour after receiving the dose on 20Jan2021, lethargy, chilled, in particular hands were very cold, pale color, mental fog, and slurred speech. The patient did not receive any treatment from events. The outcome of events was recovered in Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported temporary mental fog/mental impairment was likely related to first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient had COVID prior vaccination.  Concomitant medication in two weeks included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). The patient experienced vomited 40&#43; times, syncopal episodes, blood pressure dropped to 70/40, elevated bilirubin, elevated liver enzymes (ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase)) on 28Dec2020 19:30.

My heart rate increased and it felt as though my blood pressure decreased rapidly. After 30 minutes my symptoms had worsened and I was so disoriented I was not able to seek medical attention while being observed. I exited the building and once I got into my car my face (specifically under my eyes and on my cheeks) began swelling and a red burning rash appeared. By the time I got home (10 more minutes) I needed Benadryl immediately, I was not able to complete my sentences and all other symptoms had become more intense. I continued to take Benadryl every 4 hours for the next few days due to the symptoms consistently rebounding. I had one episode of throat tightness but it passed without use of my epipen. I checked my pulse and blood pressure frequently with the lowest reading being 93/60. Lethargy, shakiness, confusion, high heart rate all are still present after 5 days. The rash went away after 48 hours.

At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

                                                At 9:40 started to feel like my heart was racing, a weight on my chest, pain in my left chest area. Called nurse when I got to work, and they recommended going to ER. Was light headed when walking, slight headache, and chest pain moved between left chest, left arm, middle of chest.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

Blood pressure remains high throughout the day and was first noticed on 03/20/2021. I first took my blood pressure after noticing a mild headache that was not alleviated with hydration or OTC pain medication. Headaches have returned intermittently since 03/20/2021 but now only lasts 1-2 hours. Tinnitus was noticed several weeks ago (specific date is unknown) and is a mild and quiet but constant high frequency ringing. Unsure if any of these are related but I have never had tinnitus and my blood pressure is not this high nor do I have headaches often or back-to-back.

                                                Patient received the vaccine around 10:00 AM. Her husband was vaccinated immediately after her. We explained to the husband that they needed to wait around about 15 minutes to make sure they did not have any issues with the vaccine. She asked where the bathroom was while he was being vaccinated. When he was done with his vaccine, I was helping another patient register for his covid vaccine. The husband came running to the counter and stated his wife had called and said she woke up on the bathroom floor. So I immediately came and told RPH on duty and called 911.  Then went and checked on the patient and asked what happened and I told her I called EMS and they were going to come check on her to make sure she was okay. I then went and told the store manager what had occurred.  EMS came and checked on her and took her vitals and asked if she needed to be transported to the hospital at which time she declined and said she was okay. We told her that if she felt bad later to call 911, or call her doctor. The husband then took her home.

                                                Patient fainted while sitting in the waiting area about 5 minutes after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine.  Patient was unconscious briefly, but woke up after less than a minute a little disoriented.  She was sweating and felt very hot, except for her hands that were cold.  We gave her water and an ice pack to cool her down and waited with her until paramedics came to treat her.  She seemed alert and that the issue had mostly resolved as she left with paramedics approximately 15 minutes later, but it is unknown what happened after she left with them.

                                                10 minutes after the injection I felt my blood pressure rise up.  When I got home it was 134/94, machine told me I had mild hypertension. When I measured a few hours later it was at 137/90. It remained like that until the evening when it lowered back down to 120/87. Later that evening, I had a fever and took Tylenol to help. My headache got worse in the evening as well. Arm was sore. This morning (day after my 1st dose) my BP was at 108/79, fever creeped up as the day went on, body aches, arm was hurting more,  headache continued, pressure on chest made it a bit hard to breathe, dizziness, some nausea, brain fog.

                                                At 2:43pm patient received the vaccine in her arm. At 2:50pm my pharmacy technician witnessed the patient standing up from her chair and walk up to the pharmacy counter then faint into the pharmacy immunization booth. My technician states the patient did not hit her head on a wall. At 2:51pm my pharmacy technician brought the incident to my attention and we both ran to the patient to address the situation.  The patient was unresponsive, so I ran and dial 911 then instructed my tech to take the phone. I then ran back to the patient and patted her back, said her name and asked her if she could hear me.  It was at that moment the patient&#39;s eyes flickered and the patient had what looked to me like a 10 second seizure in the chair inside the pharmacy booth.  Once the patient was done what I could only identify as seizing, she came to and I asked her if she new her name and where she was. The patient answered correctly and then asked me &#34;Have you had anyone with a reaction like this before?&#34;. I answered that I have not personally witnessed a reaction like this before. My technician had 911 still on the phone and they instructed her to stand out front of the store to await the ambulance. A first responding officer came in and asked about the witnesses to the incident then took over for caring for the patient.

I told her to take Benadryl and to go to the ER or to the immediate care.  I followed up with her the next day and she went to the ER, she said the Benadryl helped her out significantly and that she was feeling much better that day.  She was still inquiring about the second shot but, she was following up with her MD on Wednesday.

                                                I had the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 4/6 and felt dizzy 30 minutes later. The dizziness continued for the next 84 hours. On 4/9 (three days after vaccination), I fainted on my  driveway as I was heading home around noon time. I felt dizzy the whole afternoon but were trying to help out the groceries from the car. I fell down on the concrete driveway with two bags of groceries on my hand. I did not blackout, but were not able to get up for 10 seconds due to the dizziness. I eventually recovered from the dizziness 84 hours after the first dose of vaccine. I injured my knee as I fell, but the wound were treated at home immediately.  As for the sore arm, I could not hold any items heavier than 1 lb. The arm soreness went away after 48 hours with ice pack applied on upper arm(injection area).

We had her lie down on the floor and raised up her legs on a chair. I applied cold towels to her neck and her forehead. She laid down for 30 minutes and sat up for a few minutes and then rose up and went back to work. Pt stated that she has a fear of needles and she faints every time she has her blood drawn.

                                                I received my first shot on April 6th, 2021, and on April 18th, 2021 I experienced extreme numbness with slight pain in the fold and shoulder of my arm. I went to the ER and they took a cat scan of my neck and reported back that everything looked normal - the nurse said it was most likely Cervical Radiculopathy. Then the following morning around 11 AM, I experienced very intense burning in my chest starting on the right side, eventually moving to the left encompassing my entire upper chest. I also experienced a very bad migraine, which I am typically used to but this one was more of a pressure headache between my temples that I felt in my ears and jaw. I made the decision to go back to the ER and to a different one this time. The ER failed to administer a Covid-19 test and to take bloodwork - both faults that family and friends in the medical field have pointed out to me. The doctor there had me receive an IV, a chest X-Ray, and an EKG. The X-Ray and EKG were both normal. The doctor had ordered a Covid-19 test but the nurse forgot to administer it before my discharge. In my IV I received Benadryl and Reglan along with typical IV fluids. I was also given Pepcid and Mylanta. At the end of my visit, the doctor concluded that he thought it was my acid reflux acting up - gastroenteritis. I went home and continued to experience chest burning, tightness, occasional numbness/pains in my body, and very, very bad headaches. On top of that, I could barely swallow - it felt as if my throat was closing. I took Pepcid and Tums and neither really did anything. After seeing a Cardiologist this same week, they ordered an Echocardiogram and routine bloodwork (metabolic panel). I will also be following up with a GI, and I received a Covid-19 test today and am awaiting the results. It is possible I contracted Covid before my shot, but it is also possible that I am having a delayed reaction to my first vaccination as well. Who knows.

                                                High fever (101°F), chills, fatigue, and burning eyes 12h post-injection. 1000mg acetaminophen would reduce fever to ~99°F within 1.5h of dosing, only to return to the high 100/low 101°F range once it starts to wear off. Fever broke in the early am hours of 4/22/21, with the chills going away as fever was gone. The burning eye sensation and tiredness were no longer present upon waking am of 4/23/21.  Itchy skin and hives on feet around noon on 4/21/21. Hives on feet disappeared on their own by early pm of 4/22/21. Itchy and sensitive skin persists as of time of this report in early pm 4/23/21. Shallow breathing (normal and deep breaths were painful), wheezing, and feeling like I&#39;m breathing through a sponge and that there is concrete (serving as weight) in my chest every time I inhaled began early am 4/21/20. I began producing mucus from deep coughs as of late pm 4/22/21 and that also continues to the time of this report, accompanied by wheezing and slightly deeper (but still shallower than normal) breathing.

The patient shortly after expressing this concern slumped over in the chair, shaking and twitching, for a few moments (likely 60 seconds or less) before regaining normal stature and attention. The patient expressed some changes in her field of vision, a continuation of feeling light-headed, and a ringing in her ears.  EMS was called to evaluate the patient, concerned that the patient had experienced seizure activity. EMS arrived shortly after, evaluating the patient&#39;s current state and vitals. After assessment, EMS determined this was a syncopal episode related to the patient&#39;s anxiety around the vaccination and cleared the patient to drive themselves home after resting on-site. Patient rested and recovered in pharmacy vaccination room for an additional 20 minutes before leaving.

                                                The morning after receiving the second COVID19 vaccine, I had the usual side effects of fever (spiking at 103), chills, muscle soreness, etc. However, when those symptoms subsided by the afternoon, I then developed intense chest pains and pressure that lasted multiple hours. At the direction of my primary care doctor, I went to an urgent care where my blood pressure was around 140/80 (I do not have a personal history of high blood pressure, and it was just checked at a normal rate at few weeks prior to receiving the vaccine) and my resting heartrate sat in the high 140s. The urgent care I went to at the time did not have a working EKG; however, they monitored my vitals and provided Motrin for the pain. After about an hour at urgent care, my resting heartrate lowered to 130s and the pain subsided. By the next morning, it still hovered around 110 and my blood pressure remained slightly elevated; however, the chest pains and pressure had completely subsided. The timeline for pain lasted roughly 5 hours, the timeline for heightened resting heart rate and blood pressure lingered for about 12 hours.

She ignored it but sensation did not go away. Sensation has extended from top to bottom on the right side of her body. In addition, she started having heart palpitation this morning. She called MD but they referred her back to the pharmacy. She is currently taking amitriptyline and stated that in the past on September 2019, she experienced the same heart palpitation when her body was under great stress. She does not think this is serious enough to go to urgent care at this time and will continue to monitor. Rph educated patient that paraesthesia is listed as one of the side effects on CDC website for this vaccine and recommended patient to continue to monitor the side effects. If symptoms worsen, she will need to go to the emergency room. Also, Rph recommended patient to potentially avoid second dose since her body has a strong reaction against this vaccine.

She went to the emergency department at Medical Center  and was diagnosed with ITP by a hematologist who recommended that she not receive the second covid vaccine given the risks outweigh the benefits with her new diagnosis/possible reaction to the vaccine.  She was treated with IVIG and prescribed corticosteroids and discharged.  Two weeks later she was visiting friends in another city and developed a severe headache.  She presented to our facility and was found to have a subdural hematoma on imaging and a platelet count of 9k cells/mm3.  She was aggressively treated for her ITP with high dose IVIG, romiplostim, and rituximab and has stabilized neurologically with the SDH stable - though her platelets have been treatment refractory despite transfusions and the aforementioned therapy.  Remains admitted at our facility.

                                                Patient reported  symptomatic heart palpitations after receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine on 5/11/2021 at 1pm which lasted a few hours. She then presented to her urgent care clinic around 3pm and was transferred to the Hospital ED. She was found to be in sinus tachycardia to HR 140s-150s. Work-up as described below was largely unrevealing. Plan for TTE on this hospital admission. Overall believe that severe anxiety is a the driving factor behind her sinus tachycardia, and that the SARS-CoV2 vaccination was just coincidental in time course.

                                                After receiving my second dose, I was seen by my primary doctor for suspected Celiac disease (which came back positive). I had a strange medical episodes during the bloodwork (April 15th) that they originally assumed was anxiety. Symptoms were shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and loss of feeling in extremities. I?m a first responder and did not feel this was anxiety, but didn?t argue and forgot about it until it happened again.   I had my second episode on April 20th, and debated going to the ER for it. A third episode on April 23rd did put me in the ER. I proceeded to have more episodes on almost a daily basis after that and started monitoring blood pressure, pulse, blood sugar, and food intake at home (some of my bloodwork levels were off due to the celiac). I purchased a heart rate monitor, a blood glucose meter, and a smartwatch to monitor some of my symptoms. Both devices (monitor and watch) would later flag me as having a suspicious heart rhythm (heart monitor could be for fast/slow rhythm or for arrhythmia, smartwatch flagged me as Afib twice). I could not recreate these results when my husband wore the devices.  Episodes could be as brief as 45 mins or last more than 12 hours. I have a high pain tolerance and illness tolerance, and had to leave work several times due to my symptoms (extremely abnormal for me).   After several more appointments with my primary doc and another visit to the ER (where they did another EKG, an X-ray, and more bloodwork), things were still coming back inconclusive.  After about April 28th, I started having significant chest pain with my episodes. The ER checked me for possible clotting related to the heart issues and my birth control pills. My arrhythmia could not be captured on their devices.   My doctor has since diagnosed it as suspected myocarditis (pending more testing). We?ve ruled out all possible things related to my Celiac diagnosis, and can?t seem to find a cause for this. I had a few things I brought to her attention that may be the cause (pinched nerve at chiropractors, covid vaccine) and she says it may be the vaccine, and said I should report it to you.

                                                Aside from the usual chills, body aches, etc, I ended up calling my doctor over a separate concerning issue - very high heart rate. I woke up at 8am the day after getting my 2nd Pfizer dose, walked to use the restroom, walked back to bed, and laid back down. Within a couple minutes I noticed my heart felt like it was racing and I was out of breath as if I had just come back from a jog, not a trip to the restroom.  Heart rate continued fluctuating from 105-115bpm just laying in bed. Was also feeling fatigued, nauseous, dizzy when standing up, and with slight difficulty breathing. Called advice nurse after 30min of no change. They had me check heart rate manually (had been going off FitBit), and timing was consistent with what FitBit was reading . Nurse advised to keep resting and drink lots of water, scheduled follow-up with a Doctor later in the morning.  It should be noted that I had been alternating between water and Pedialyte constantly all day, starting 5/17 through when this happened (and then the next few days as well), so I should not have been dehydrated. Follow-up call with Dr. (on-call Dr., not my usual one) was scheduled for 11:45am, and by then all concerning heart symptoms had passed. The Dr. basically reiterated what the nurse had told me, in keeping up with fluids. And that sometimes temperature change, even if you don&#39;t completely get a fever, can cause a high heart rate. As more information is coming out regarding younger people developing myocarditis after the mRNA vaccines however, I wanted to mention this in case it could possibly be related.

                                                All of the below occurred after Pfizer shot #2 administered on 4/1/2021. Pfizer shot #1 was administered on 3/12/2021 with minimal effects lasting less than 24 hours (arm soreness, flu-like symptoms, etc.).  1) Severe worsening of costochondritis (chronic chest pain) to the point of breathing difficulty and inability to lie down. Began 4/1/2021 and became unbearable the evening of 4/7/2021, requiring an ER trip the same night (see Item 19). This pain has since continued to come and go, worse than I ever had it before the vaccine.  2) Very severe worsening of tinnitus (ringing/pulsing in ears) - lasted 1.5 months, from 4/1/2021 to around 5/15/2021.  3) Severe hormone imbalance symptoms (waves of severe nausea occurring several times daily, extremely late and painful/heavy period, swelling in ankles &amp; feet, etc.) for ~1.5 months, from late April 2021 to around 5/15/2021. I cannot identify any other changes or life factors besides the vaccine that would have caused these issues.

                                                Patient received the 2nd COVID vaccine (Pfizer, Lot #: EW0187 and expiration date: 08/31/2021) around 1439 on the left arm. Patient walked up to the observation desk around 1449, during her 30 minute observation period, with complaints of &#34;dizziness, rapid heart rate, and feeling hot.&#34; Patient was conscious, alert, and oriented x4 and claimed symptoms began 2 minutes status post vaccine administration. Patient denied any reaction after receiving the 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine and denied experiencing any chest pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. EMTs had patient sit in the anti- gravity chair for further evaluation. Nurse responded to EMTs with patient. At 1455, EMT obtained baseline vital signs, while patient was sitting: blood pressure: 124/70, heart rate: 72, respiratory rate: 15. Pupils were equal, accommodating, and reactive to light. Skins were warm, dry, and normal. Chief complaint of  &#34;dizziness, rapid heart rate, and feeling hot&#34; was reassessed and patient stated that symptoms had subsided. Patient explained that the symptoms had a sudden onset, but lasted less than 1 minute. Patient has a history of migraines and an allergy to Penicillin. Patient stated that she had a similar reaction after receiving a dose of Benadryl, earlier this year. Patient told EMTs that she had eaten toast, tofu, and salad about an hour and a half prior to coming to the vaccination site, with limited fluid intake. EMTs gave the patient a water bottle to sip on. At 1502 a second set of vital signs were obtained by EMT, while the patient was sitting: blood pressure: 116/68, heart rate: 74, respiratory rate: 15. Pupils were equal, accommodating, and reactive to light. Patient was advised to stay an additional 30 minutes in observation for continued evaluation. Patient stated she &#34;felt better&#34; and all symptoms had improved. Final set of vital signs were taken at 1514 by EMT, while patient was standing: blood pressure: 114/64, heart rate: 72, respiratory rate: 12. Pupils were equal, accommodating, and reactive to light. Skins were warm, dry, and normal. Patient was negative for orthostatic pressures. At 1540, patient stated she &#34;felt normal and that all symptoms were gone.&#34; Patient had finished the water bottle provided. Patient was then educated on expected/ adverse reactions, when to follow up with her primary care provider, and the use of V- Safe. Patient ambulated with a steady gait on her own accord out of the facility.
