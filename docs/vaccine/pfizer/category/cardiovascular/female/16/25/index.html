                                                Patient in clinic for chief complaint of possible side effect of the covid vaccine which she received yesterday.  She states that she woke up at 0200 with chest tightness, achyness and headache.  She rates the discomfort 7/10 last night and improved now to 5/10.  She denies any worsening with any type of exertion and states that she can do simple things like take a shower, walk across the room, down the street or even stairs without any worsening.  She denies any SOB or chest pain--just feels tight.  Doesn&#39;t feel like she can&#39;t get a full breath or get the air out of her lungs either.  She received her first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday (4:23pm) and had no difficulty with the injection itself and then 9.5 hours later woke up from sleep with this chest tightness as well as achyness and headache.    She states that she had the exact same symptoms when she had positive covid test back in August of this year with the addition of fatigue which lasted for 5 days.  At that time it was not felt necessary to do any further testing nor treat with steroids according to cardiology.  She does have history of LV non-compaction cardiomyopathy and her last visit with cardiology was about 2 years ago and she had a normal EKG and echo only showed &#34;mild LV non compaction at the apex&#34; at that time. He did not need to see her again until she is 18 unless she has problems.  She states that she generally does very well and other than this tightness she does not have any other significant symptoms.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

                                                Patient fainted and hyporesponsive.; Patient fainted and hyporesponsive.; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other healthcare professional.  A 21-year-old non-pregnant female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot number: En9265, intramuscular on 13Feb2021 at 14:00 (at the age of 21 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient fainted and was hyporesponsive on 13Feb2021. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Feb2021. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on vaccine-event chronological association, a causal relationship between events fainted and was hyporesponsive and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 09:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.

On 16Jan2021 09:20, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient felt like she was going to pass out reported as vasovagal reaction, and experienced heart beat was high, fatigue, woozy/dizzy, hard to concentrate, feeling hot, and felt as though she was on the verge of a headache but never got one/she felt like the blood was rushing to her head. On 16Jan2021 10:00, 1 hour after vaccination, the patient experienced had to fall asleep. On the day she got the shot she sat for a full hour with the nurse to be monitored. Then she went home.

The patient was wondering if this could be a side effect 2 weeks after getting the shot or if she should look elsewhere on what could be causing these events. She is supposed to get the second dose on Friday and was wondering about getting the second dose after her experience. Patient wanted to know it is safer for her to have the 2nd dose. No physician office visit and emergency room visit. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was recovered on 16Jan2021 18:00.

I was fine with these symptoms as I knew they were common side effects until my heart rate spiked from about 60 to the 160s and I began to have a throbbing headache. I could not get my heart rate to come down, I was calm and knew it was not anxiety so I went to the ER where they did blood tests, EKG, UA and gave me fluids. Everything came back normal but my heart rate continued to be elevated around 130s for a couple more hours, finally came down to about 100-110, HR is still slightly elevated and I still have a fever of 100.4 and migraine

Was feeling well prior to that.  Has soreness at her arm as well.  She has a history of POTS and did detect a rapid heart rate at home.  She has mild sinus tachycardia at this time reports a gradual improvement in symptoms.  Fever is improving, had not had any antipyretic prior to coming in.  I have low suspicion for acute infection and would favor immune response to the vaccine itself which has been reported in multiple persons receiving same vaccine.  She is not hypoxic, has clear breath sounds.  No thrombocytopenia on CBC.  IV was placed, IV fluids given.  Heart rate improved, blood pressure remained stable.  Patient feels well enough for discharge on reevaluation and declined need for analgesic or antipyretic here.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height. AE Details and time of onset: Sore Throat 12:00 on 29 Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling 20:00 Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102: 21:00 Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes- 21:00 Migraine- 21:00 Frequent Urination 23:00 Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids 23:00 Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in: 21:00. ER or physician&#39;s office required: Went to urgent care 36 hours after administration. No treatment given. She just wanted to make sure no additional infection was causing anything weird. All test were negative. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): none. Events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102 were serious with criteria of medically significant, while the other events were non-serious. The outcome of the event Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling/Sore throat (Condition worsened) was unknown, the outcome of the events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102., Migraine, Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids, Frequent urination was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal association.

Treated with ibuprofen. 21 hours post vaccination was the peak of the symptoms, temperature of 101.6 with ibuprofen, strong body aches, weakness, and anorexia. Symptoms became more mild at hour 31 post vaccine. I had a swollen lymph node after the first vaccine above my left collarbone (injected on left side) and still have this, and now I have a swollen armpit that is very painful on my right side (injected on the right side).

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 23-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 02Mar2021, 16:15, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, covid back in Dec2020, known allergies to flu vaccine and TB test and seizure (have history). Concomitant medications included levetiracetam (KEPPRA), lamotrigine (LAMICTAL), cenobamate (XCOPRI) and magnesium. The patient had no other vaccine in 4 weeks. On 02Mar2021 16:15, the patient experienced arm swelling, pain, itching, couldn&#39;t feel lower legs, extreme chest pains and chills. On 02Mar2021, at 17:15, the patient experienced headache an hour later. On 03Mar2021 01:00, the patient experienced seizure at the middle of the night around 01:00. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had Covid prior vaccination; and was not Covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of event seizure was not recovered; outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient had underlying epilepsy. However, based on the close temporal association, a possible contributory role of bnt162b2 to the development of seizure cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I felt very fatigued starting around 6pm. Severe chills began around 9pm, followed by a fever. The fever went from 100.1 to 102.2 over the course of about an hour (11:30pm-12:30pm), at which time I took 400mg of ibuprofen. The fever was 102.1 thirty minutes after taking the ibuprofen. Along with the fever I experienced tachycardia, body and muscle aches, and moderate to severe deltoid pain at the injection site. I believe the fever broke around 3:00am. The fatigue and body aches lasted about 24 hours since they began, but the majority  of the rest of my symptoms were gone after the fever. The arm pain at injection site was noticeable and painful for about 72 hours before subsiding.

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

                                                had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 24-year-old female patient (currently 25-years-old) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 24-years-old) on 06Jan2021 12:45 at 0.3 mL, single in right deltoid for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899, expiry date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month on 09Jan2021 13:00 with outcome of not recovered. She reported, &#34;I&#39;ve had both doses of the vaccine. The last one was on 06Jan2021. I have had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month.&#34; She says she got the second dose 06Jan2021 and on 09Jan2021 she was at the doctor&#39;s office and he felt what he thought is a swollen lymph node like under her clavicle, it is the size of a golf ball now, it is not going away. She says the swollen lymph node is under the clavicle on her left side. The doctor didn&#39;t seem too concerned about it but it has been almost a month and it is still there she doesn&#39;t know what it is but it is still there. She confirms the second dose was 06Jan2021 and on 09Jan2021 her doctor noticed it was swollen, she didn&#39;t even notice it before he did. She thinks it has gotten worse but she also might be freaking out for no reason but she thinks it has gotten bigger. She says she has the information for the first dose but the second dose is on another card because she forgot the card when she went back for the second dose. The information for the second dose is at home and she is not at home right now. She does not see an NDC Number. She says the lot number information could be available later if needed for follow up because the card is at home. Dose: It is not on the card but she thinks it is 0.3 ml, she doesn&#39;t remember for sure. At the time she got the dose she was being treated for ring worm. Her doctor did draw a Calcium and a PTH and they were both normal. She says the doctor was not too concerned about but it has been almost a month and it still has not gone down (as reported). She has asthma which she has been dealing with kind of on and off because this winter has been so cold but other than that nothing else has happened, her vitals are normal she did not even have any temperature or anything after the vaccine. The event was assessed as non-serious. Vaccination Facility Type was hospital. The adverse event did not require a visit to the Emergency Room or Physician Office. It was noted while she was in the doctors office but she has not had to go back for it. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

Symptoms started 20 minutes following administration of vaccine and resolved about 30 minutes thereafter.  EMS came - thought it could be related to anxiety.

A rapid response was called, and was given Benadryl. She was brought to ED for monitoring and treatment, where she received more Benadryl &#43; Famotidine. After receiving the medications, symptoms subsided, and she was discharged home.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; brand: Pfizer Biotech; lot number: EL0142) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 30Dec2020 at 12:45 PM at a single dose (dose number: 1) for COVID-19 immunization. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was workplace clinic. Medical history included premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). No known allergies (no allergies to medications, food, or other products). The patient was not pregnant. No other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced adverse events included blood pressure dropped to 70/50, heart rate went up to 140, whole body got cold and tingly and she got tunnel vision and almost passed out. The events all started on 30Dec2020 at 12:45 PM. The events were reported as non-serious. No treatment received for events. The outcome of events was resolving. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

                                                I received the vaccine on 12/29 at approximately 12:30 pm. On 12/31 I woke up with itching in my scalp. On 1/1 the itching started spreading throughout my body. I have continuously been itching since 12/31. The itching is all over my scalp, arms, hands, back, and legs. I have recently developed a pain/pressure in the back of my head, that feels like I have smacked it against a wall. I have also recently developed pain in my chest. I have seen my PCP, dermatologist, and ED drs and no one can find a route cause for my reaction.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

A 25-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 07Jan2021 13:30 at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, fibromyalgia, idiopathic hypersomnia, seasonal allergies (dust, ragweed, pollen, dander), covid-19. Concomitant medication in two weeks included duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA), modafinil, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), ergocalciferol (VIT D). No other vaccine in four weeks. 1-2 min after shot the patient became flushed and felt uncomfortable/ couldn&#39;t sit still, began feeling clammy, saw spots, BP dropped to 60s/30s, all other vitals stable, felt like throat was closing and couldn&#39;t breathe well, hands were numb, lips were white/ blue. No itching or hives. Resolved with trendelenburg and rest, fluids given in ED. WBCs and neutrophils and platelets elevated 3 hours later. Coat hanger neck/ shoulder pain for the next few days. Adverse event start date was 07Jan2021 01:30. Event resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Covid was not tested post vaccination. Outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.
