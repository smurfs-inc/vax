And because of this he was little pale in color and he had no local reaction to the vaccine on his arm and he was communicating with us. we did call the ems services and they took him  to the ambulance and per father he was let go after some time in the ambulance once he felt better.

                                                From ED Note: 12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.   Mom notes that he was in his usual state of health when he presented to COVID clinic to get his first vaccine. He got the Pfizer vaccine, seconds after getting in his left arm, mom noted that he looked very &#34;wide eyed&#34; and distraught.  She notes that he slumped forward and had lost consciousness for approximately 5 seconds.  She noticed shaking movements in his right arm and bilateral lower legs.  She notes that his left arm was against her and therefore cannot comment on it.  She notes that his eyes were closed.  No tongue biting and no incontinence.  No secondary trauma.  She notes that when these 5 seconds were over he then had a period for about 30 minutes where he looked pale and was breathing heavy but was alert and answering questions.  She notes that he has had presyncopal episodes and episodes of feeling faint when getting flu shots in the past.  However, this time she noted that he had shaking which made her nervous for possible seizure activity.  Patient denies any chest pain or headache prior to the symptoms.  She came via ambulance for further evaluation.   On arrival, he reports that he feels 90% back to his baseline.  He notes that he does not feel quite ready to run around yet however denies any pains or discomforts, headache, weakness, numbness, or tingling.   He had eaten a full breakfast prior to getting the shot.  He had a normal night sleep and a normal day yesterday per mom.   Medical History: as above  Surgical history: none Family History: Reviewed and no pertinent related family hx pertaining to this visit Social History: Lives with family  Allergies: food allergies  Medications: flovent, epi-pen Immunizations: Up to date  Medical Decision Making  12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.  On arrival, he was alert, well-appearing, in no acute distress.  His vital signs were normal for age on room air.  His physical exam was very reassuring as above with a normal neurologic and cardiac evaluation.   Differential includes vasovagal/syncope in the setting of a known stressful trigger vs seizure given report of shaking in his extremities.  We feel the latter is significantly less likely given the timeline of the events.  Has no known seizure activity nor any triggers per history (fever, trauma, etc.).  He also has a normal neurologic assessment. At this time we will defer neurology consults given low concern for seizure.  It is possible that this represents a side effect of the vaccine however we also feel that this is less likely given the fact that his symptoms have been seconds after receiving the vaccine.  Nonetheless we reported the symptoms to the pharmacist who recorded it in the database.  We attained an EKG showing a known incomplete right bundle branch block (unchanged from 2013) and a slightly prolonged QTC of 477 (previously 451).    I encourage patient to stay well-hydrated, well rested in the setting of his suspected syncopal episode this morning.  I also suggested that for further vaccinations, that he lay down on the table and drink/eat well prior.  We provided strict return to ED criteria in the setting of worsening symptoms. All questions were answered at the time of discharge. Mom verbalized her understanding and agreement of the plan. He was discharged in a stable condition with mom at side.    **After patient was discharged, cardiology called the follow-up team due to the prolonged QTC to ensure that we were aware.  I contacted the patient&#39;s PCP to do a follow-up EKG in 1 month&#39;s time.

                                                Patient received the vaccination.  Approximately 20 seconds after receiving the dose patient said &#34;I&#39;m going to faint&#39;.  Patient appeared to  faint but also appeared to be having a seizure.  The patients legs appeared to go rigid and he make movements with his arms. He appeared very pale.  The patient &#34;came to&#34; within approximately a minute?  Patients mother and I were able to lay Patient down on the floor. I asked his mother if she would like us to call 911 and she said yes.  Prior to the incident, I discussed Patients past history of seizures with his mother. She sail he had seizures when he was younger and had been on medication, but he was no longer on any medication and had been seizure free for approximately 5 years.

I (pharmacist) was alerted to the event and I and couple technicians went out to assist patient.  I elevated child&#39;s feet,  supported head, took blood pressure and pulse. Child regained consciousness and was able to respond to name in less than two minutes. Child stated that he was hot and agreed to drinking cold water. I also applied cold compress to child&#39;s forehead and wrists. Child took sips of water and BP was continuously monitored. Parents stated that child looked much better and had regained color to his face. Child was monitored to 30 mins by the pharmacy team with no event before parents took child home.

                                                Pt had vasovagal reaction and emesis immediately post vaccine admin. NO ALLERGY to vaccine. Okay to receive 2nd dose.  At 1:37PM, 6 min post receiving vaccine, patient told mom that he felt lightheaded and was having pain at injection site left arm. Rn assessed immediately and pt reported feeling &#34;sick&#34;.  He drank few sips of water. MD called to bedside. I assessed pt at 1:39PM, pt sitting chair, elevated his legs onto the footrests of wheelchair sitting in front of pt.  &#43;Facial and lip pallor,  and   complaining of nausea followed by 1 episode NBNB emesis consisting of what he ate for lunch 1 hour prior. Pt immediately reported feeling better post emesis. Lips appeared pink. Pt brought to triage area, lay supine on stretcher with legs elevated. Nausea and &#34;lightheaded&#34; sensation resolved prior to lying down. BP improved post emesis from 75/39 to 84/46 at 1:48 PM. Stayed lying down for 5 minutes after which time pt wanted to sit up.  Upon sitting BP and HR increased 96/64 and 69, stable with no nausea or lightheadedness, only remaining  sx &#34;slightly weak&#34;. drank 12 oz apple juice and ate 2 graham crackers without any further emesis or symptoms. Observed for 15 more minutes and was ambulating without return of symptoms, discharged home with mom and brother with instructions to seek medical care if symptoms return.

                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

He subsequently developed fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.  The day prior to admission, he developed a diffuse popular rash.  He was seen in clinic on 5/20 and lab work was obtained, which was consistent with MIS-C findings (elevated troponin, elevated fibrinogen, elevated CRP, hyponatremia, relatively low absolute lymphocyte count).

Upon approaching vehicle, patient is in passenger side of his mothers van, with mother in driver seat, and is awake.  Patient is very pale and is sipping on Powerade.  Mother reports that patient passed out for about 10 seconds about 3 minutes after receiving Covid vaccine.  She also reports that patient does this every time he gets any type of injection.  Blood pressure at this time 118/60.  Patient is becoming less pale and reports he is starting to feel better.  Patient reports that he hasn&#39;t had anything to eat or drink all day.  Patient and mother deny the need to call the ambulance for evaluation.  Patient continues to be less pale and feeling better.  Encouraged patient and mother to always and eat and drink before receiving an injection and to wait at least 15 minutes and to make sure he is feeling completely back to normal before leaving.  Patient and mother report good understanding.

                                                My son developed a  fever,  brain fog,  and his legs felt like they were burning. More worrisome was the heart pain he woke up with in the middle of the night and throughout the day on 5/20. He complained of a sharp stabbing pain on left side of his chest and said it was hard to take a deep breath. I gave him ibuprofen and he rested. I called his doctor and they said not to worry, these side effects were normal. I?m a bit nervous for him to get the second vaccine  since he had the chest pain side effects as to why I?m reporting this. I?m surprised they give the same dose to a 80lb child, they do to a 200 lb grown man.

Once I got to the patient he had come to, mom said he was out for about 10-15 seconds max and patient says he did hit his head. Oxygen saturation was 99% on RA, heart rate was 62bpm. BP 110/78. Patient was alert and oriented once I was assessing him. He was able to sit up in the floor about 5 minutes after coming to. He was able to drink water and the PCT had placed cool wet paper towels on his head and neck area. We provided the patient crackers and the management team was available. The patient said he felt like his stomach was upset and did not want the crackers. I suggested he go to the ER and mom said she would drive him and asked if this was caused by the vaccine itself. I explained what could have occurred and educated them on where he hit his head he needs to go to the ER to be assessed. Mom agreed and the manager got a wheelchair from the front of the store and mom drove him to the ER. I called report to ER.

For the first 30 seconds the open mouth struggling look for breath had me thinking he was choking. Breathing improved but chest pain stayed intense for about 20 minutes. He went to sleep and the next morning said ?it kind of hurt but not much?. After the morning of May 23rd he hasn?t reported any other pain.

                                                Patient started to develop a cough on the second day of the vaccine around 6 pm. The cough was accompanied by shortness of breath, given his asthma we assumed this was some asthma related reaction to the vaccine. Nonetheless, that evening he started to complain about chest pain every time he laid back on his bed. This symptom is not common in previous asthma attacks. Sitting up alleviated the symptom, chest pain and shortness of breath lasted for 2 nights (Sunday and Monday evening), by Tuesday he felt better. We assumed this was an asthma episode, but recent reports of Myocarditis leads us to believe the had a mild myocarditis episode, given the chest pain while lying down.  He also had typical COVID vaccine symptoms such as low grade fever (100F), pain in the vaccination site, congestion, and itchy throat.

Also, lower abdominal pain but no vowel issues.

Complained of pain when taking a deep breath and would flinch in pain. By the time got to ER in the afternoon, pain had subsided. Not sure if vaccine related but never had chest pains before &amp; considering report of myocarditis after 2nd shot for younger males. Wanted this documented in case there is a pattern.

                                                The next morning he woke up with arm  hurting him (he couldn&#39;t lift it). He felt a little warm - had a low grade fever -99.something. He had a headache all day. He was very sluggish, tired. He did online school that day. He took a nap and laid down on the couch in between classes. He was really tired. I was giving him Tylenol every four hours. The first time he felt a little better, The second time, it didn&#39;t work. I called the doctor for advice and he told me to give him Children&#39;s Motrin. That seemed to do better. I gave that to him once that day.  The next morning, he felt better. I gave him a Motrin anyway  because he had a light headache. He did say he felt some heart racing. And he was a little tired. He called me from school around 11:30 am and he said that his heart has been racing through the whole morning - he was gym and said  he couldn&#39;t run or anything but his heart was racing. I told him to go to t he school nurse - he had a pulse of 120. I met him there and I called the pediatrician and he saw him at 03:00. His pulse was high but not as high as before. He had rested in between. My son did see a cardiologist in June 2020- they put him on a heart monitor and she couldn&#39;t find anything at that time. At the regular doctor on the 19th, the doctor checked breathing and heart but did not have the materials at that location to do an EKG but said with the lowered heart rate just to watch and if it goes up again to go to Cardiologist we saw in June 2020. He rested some more and it went away on it&#39;s own. After that he was fine and no other issues. In fact, the next day he felt better and was running around and had energy and felt great.

From EHR note: Patient is an otherwise healthy 12yM with recent Lyme disease (erythema migrans) transferred to hospital for hyponatremia, encephalitis, myocarditis. Initially intubated due to aspiration risk, now s/p extubation and stable on RA. Broad workup so far including consultations from neurology, cardiology, immunology, and infectious disease with unclear etiology, s/p MRI and LP with c/f covid-vaccine related myocarditis/encephalitis vs lyme carditis/meningoencephalitis vs less likely MISC vs other. Infectious testing so far negative, patient otherwise has returned to baseline behavior without any current symptoms. He is transferred to general for further workup and evaluation and close monitoring. Diagnosed with Lyme 19 days prior to admission,  treated with amoxicillin; p/w headache, fever and vomiting so concern for encephalitis as above vs inflammatory process post-COVID or vaccine. Less likely meningitis given reassuring initial CSF studies. Negative COVID antibody.  Resolving hyponatremia, thought to be likely SIADH. Given presentation and maternal history of albinism with immunodeficiency, broad workup sent. Also with c/f possible inflammatory response/MISC-C vs vaccine myocarditis.

A 12-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: unknown and Expire Date: unknown) on 22May2021 via unspecified route of administration as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. As medical history it was reported that, he had allergies and allergic to a lot of things, mold, feather dust and everything and dyspepsia. He had been taking Claritin for allergies (but not when he got the vaccine). She stated her son did not have any allergies to medications. Concomitant mediations were not reported. On 26May2021, 4 days after that he was complaining of chest pain. Caller wants to know if her son should get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Caller stated, &#34;He had other symptoms. On Tuesday the chest pain went away then complained again on Thursday. His doctor gave him an EKG and his heart rate was fine. Caller did not take him to the ER at the time because did not want a medical bill. His blood sugar spiked up. He had sweating, vomiting, diarrhea. He said he had &#34;sharp pain in my chest and never felt that before&#34; His blood sugar spiked up. He was dehydrated. He had ketones from it. Caller gave him extra insulin. He had chest pain from the vaccine. It was on Tuesday and happened again on Thursday but had not come back since then. It subsided. EKG was ok.&#34; No one was informed (doctors). I took him to the regular doctor. She did not know. She was not aware of the symptoms. They are not specialized in the medications they are giving. It was hard to give them any kind of referral. Both of us had vomiting, headaches and chills. He had never had chest pains from any vaccines. He had fatigue, these are symptoms form the covid shot. It was 4 days and then 6 days after the vaccine. A fast heartbeat. HCP are not going to help. If they are dosing the covid shots but they are not given the vaccines they did not want to do anything. There was no accountability. Caller having a hard time. No one can give me an answer, no one. Not from the experts, no one was telling me. The vaccine administration should have been through the doctors, they will not take your data without understanding the vaccines. All the kids 12 and up and all male and like my son and probably a lot more but they are not saying it. Caller scared. My son did not have a heart defect. Caller did not know. Heart inflammation; they need to know if it was safe or not. It was scary to know no one knows what was going on or not. Caller asked about myocarditis. The patient had heart burn before but said the chest pain was not that. With the symptoms the caller saw online, she thinks the patient had pericarditis. The patient&#39;s next dose was on 12Jun2021.The caller was reading online that people reported chest pain and ended up in the emergency room and the caller did not want that. All the events occurred on an unspecified date in May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood glucose increased: spiked up on May2021, electrocardiogram: fine on 25May2021 EKG and his heart rate was fine, heart rate increased: fast on 25May2021. The outcome of event chest pain was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of dehydrated. The outcome of blood sugar spiked up, sweating, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, felt sick, extreme fatigue, and slept on and off for about 4 days, dehydration, fast heartbeat and pericarditis was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Threw up twice on Friday June 4 at 9:30am &amp; 1:30 pm. Very uncomfortable, bad headache, no energy. Mostly slept from 6pm Friday June 4 to 5am Saturday June 5. Immediately threw up when he woke up Friday. Threw up again about 30 min. later and 4 more times during the day. Still having bad head pain. Started to become confused and say things that didn&#39;t make sense. Went to ER around 4:30pm Saturday June 5. Blood work showed his sodium level was dangerously low. He was immediately given sodium and transported to Hospital ICU. Had brain MRI, lumbar puncture and lots of blood work done. Brain MRI showed signs of encephalitis. Also had myocarditis. Was in hospital until Thur. June 10. Encephalitis and myocarditis seemed to resolve quickly and he was just treated with rest and fluids along with antibiotics in case there was any viral/infectious cause of symptoms. All such tests have been negative to date

                                                After receiving the second dose on 6/15, my son woke up at 3:30am on 6/16 with a nose bleed that lasted as a steady light stream for about 5 minutes.  He also had a slight fever of 100.  By 7:30am on 6/16 his fever was slowly increasing and the nausea began.  He did not throw up but it is now 10:45am on 6/16 and his fever is 102.6 and he is still nauseous.  I&#39;m not too worried since these are all common symptoms but I felt like I should should report them since he is 12 years old.

                                                Patient received 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine on 6/10/2021. Initially had typical symptoms of fatigue and arm pain. On 6/13/2021, woke up with  central chest pain and &#34;fluttering&#34; of his heart. Mother read the Agency website concerning possible myocarditis after Covid vaccinations so then took him to the ED.  The chest pain lasted about an hour (resolved in triage in the ED). There he had a normal ECG and chest x-ray. He was referred to see me in clinic on 6/15/2021. He had a normal echocardiogram. Due to the parental concern for possible myocarditis, I recommended a troponin which would show if his chest pain were possibly related to that. It returned mildly elevated at 0.21 ng/mL, prompting me to enter this as a possible mild case of myocarditis after vaccination.

Highest recorded temp was 102.2 at approx. 30 hours after shot.   Fatigue interfered with daily activities from 12 hours after shot to 36 hours after shot.  Mild soreness in arm where shot was given.   Pulse and blood oxygen were checked each time temp was taken (approx 3 times between 24 and 36 hours after shot) and were within normal ranges each time; although pulse was on the higher end of the normal range for a 12 year old boy.  Quick recover starting 36 hours after shot, when temp reduced to approx. 100.  Appetite returned at this time.

                                                Had the vaccine on Saturday and on Tuesday afternoon, felt very dizzy, became very pale, had chest pain,  pressure in  chest and couldn&#39;t take a deep breath,  vision kept moving in and out, had to sit down, felt very hot and cold at the same time and was actually sweating and feeling chills. Took it easy for the next 4-5 days and just stayed home and in bed. When it got really bad, took a dose of ibuprofen.  The symptoms slowly got better and disappeared. Took about three doses of ibuprofen total over a few days. Talked to our pediatrician a week later who said we should report this.

                                                Patient is a previously healthy fully-vaccinated 12 yo presenting with fever and chest pain. He had fevers to 101-102 6/17-6/19 that were responsive to antipyretics, then the chest pain started 6/20 and has been constant 5/10 pain since. It is burning and located substernal/between the scapula. Activity/breathing doesn&#39;t worsen the pain, but it is worst at night. He also reports a mild headache today that has since resolved. He went to his PCP today and had an EKG concerning for diffuse precordial ST elevations, so he was referred to the ED with concern for myo/pericarditis.   Of note, Patient received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 6/11.  He also travels every week and has removed ticks from himself that were unattached.  No known bites and no rashes.  He has not had any n/v/d, no abdominal pain, no cough/congestion/rhinorrhea, no syncope, no palpitations.   In the ED, he was well-appearing but tachycardic to the 120s with otherwise normal vitals. He developed fever to Tmax 38.3 that improved with Motrin. On exam he had rash concerning for erythema migrans with multiple satellite lesions. He an EKG with ST elevations in the inferolateral leads. POC US did not show any pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted (see consult note) and recommended troponin, which was 1.08, and CRP, which was 7.52.  CXR showed clear lungs and normal cardiac contours.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted for further workup and management of his perimyocarditis. Given his erythema migrans rash and positive history of recent multiple tick exposure, we were concerned about Lyme disease (Lyme antibody pending) and sent testing for co-infection (Anaplasma, Ehrlichiosis) with smear negative for Babesia. We treated him empirically with doxycycline (given antibiotic allergies) and his rash improved. We also considered myocarditis following COVID vaccination. He had serial EKG&#39;s done which showed low-normal function, with EF=55.2%. He had serial troponins sent and they were downtrending at the time of discharge. He had chest pain that improved with PRN ibuprofen. He did not require steroids or IVIG. Cardiac MRI was completed prior to discharge and showed normal function and an area of subepicardial LV myocardial late gadolinium enhancement. consistent with myocarditis. At the time of discharge, he had no chest pain, was eating and drinking normally, and family was in agreement with plan for close Cardiology and Infectious Disease follow-up.

                                                He was ok, when he took his vaccine. He went swimming next week on Tuesday he developed a headache after swimming, I decided to take his BP and temp, his temp was normal and his blood pressure was low his heart rate was fast, it showed an irregular heart beat, I checked it with different monitor just in case it was off and it was the same. After a few days I decided to take him to the clinic and asked them to check if he is having an irregular heartbeat, he was showing low bp and a high heart rate. They sent him to ER they did an EKG, That Dr. sent him home, and the next few days I contacted his pediatrician and oncologist they told me to keep watching and monitoring his bp and heart rate. We saw a cardiologist, they found he doesn&#39;t have a consistent beat he was diagnosed Frequently Ventricular Ectopy.

                                                12 Y 4 M old male with a history of chest pain that started two days ago on Monday. On 7/11 night, he didn&#39;t feel well felt nauseous. He was able to sleep but had chest pain the following morning that improved after he vomited. The chest pain is midsternal and feels pressure-like. It lasted a few hours. He swam on 7/12 without problems (at a swim club) for an hour. He had his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday 7/10/21. There has not been any fevers. Elevated troponin and CRP with recent COVID-19 vaccine, suspicious for post-vaccine myocarditis. He is hemodynamically stable with normal vitals and no evidence of ventricular ectopy or depressed left ventricular function. His troponin peaked at 11.05 and trended down, but his most recent value is slightly up at 8.2 from 7.6. Recommended continuing to trend the troponins for now (if they show a downward trend then twice daily is adequate, unless he develops chest pain). At this time, IVIG is held unless he becomes unstable or  the troponins trend upward .

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

We walked around the store, conversed, and 10-12 minutes after injection he had syncope and generalized tonic clonic seizure for minutes. We were transported 911 to Hospital ED where he had normal labs, normal brain MRI, and consultation with Peds Neuro. He was post-ictal for 30&#43; minutes to follow the incident. He has secondary trauma to his R temporal and occipital bones and likely a mild concussion resulting from the fall.

Had him sit, take off his mask, gave him water to sip, took BP (102/60), within 5 minutes he started to come back around, was able to follow command (wiggle fingers) vocalize that he could breathe fine, and felt that there was water behind his ears. His temperature to touch seemed to start to go back down, and once paramedics arrived they evaluated him and released him as &#34;ok&#34; within 10 minutes.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient fainted.  The mother caught her son in her arms and we were both able to lay him on the floor safely without hitting his head.  He came to within a few seconds.  He remained in the pharmacy area for approximately 20 more minutes for observation.  He was feeling back to normal before leaving.

                                                Roughly 7-10 mins after the patient received the vaccine he complains of black out and cant see anything for a couple minutes and feeling weak and nausea.  I measured the patient blood pressure and it seems lower than normal. After the patient rest for a while I reassess the patient blood pressure and he seemed to feel a lot better. I asked the family to stay for additional 15 mins or 20 mins to observe him but they insist on leaving . I instructed the parents to observe him and if he gets worst get medical help. I have a staff member at the facility to call the family after 30 mins later and the parents stated he is moving around and feel a lot better.  The parents also called back a few hours later and stated he is doing good.

                                                Patient developed SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) approximately 29 hours after receiving the COVID vaccine.  Patient has no prior history of SVT or any other cardiac related events.  Patient was engaged in a basketball game when the SVT occurred.

Nothing concerning but right before he went to bed he didn&#39;t feel good. My son thought he had to vomit but couldn&#39;t. He said his HEARTBEAT WAS SO MUCH FASTER than normal. I got so concerned that I slept next to him which I never did before. He fell asleep after 1 h and woke up the next morning and felt fine. I did not go to the doctor because he was feeling well the next day.

He hydrated with water that day very well and I gave him 500 mg of Tylenol. On Sunday (2 days after vaccine) we were at church celebrating outdoor Mass. about 20 minutes into church my son said he didn?t feel well and needed water. He was standing at the time he said this. He had been standing under and umbrella the entire time to shade him from the sun. About 1 minute later he fainted. He visually looked very pale at the time. We treated him with by having sit down, moved him to air conditioning. It took about an hour before he felt back to baseline.

He noticed a couple of episodes of heart racing (was not noticing other episodes) but no HR obtained.   He developed more pluetitic chest pain at the site of his rib pain and persistent fatigue.   Seen in my office three times over the next 7-10 days. and symptoms persisted.   Testing included CXR and ECG which were normal.   COVID PCR NP swab was negative and blood work was normal (cbc, ebv/cmv titers, thyroid).  He was evaluated by cardiology on 5/24/21 and diagnosed with POTS.   Currently (early June) he continues to have fatigue significant enough that he can&#39;t get through an entire school day (very atypical for him) and has intermittent pleuritic chest pain (which had mostly resolved about 10 days after the vaccine)   The tachycardia has resolved for the most part (within 2 weeks of the vaccine)

Felt tired that night and into the next day with some local swelling and pain to the right arm at site of injection, and also into right armpit. Thursday evening, he was resting sitting on the couch and developed some mild chest pain. Can&#39;t really describe the location or severity very well. Did seem to be worse with inspiration. Hasn&#39;t reoccurred since that time. Still feels somewhat tired today with mildly sore right arm. No fevers. No chest pain today.    IR showed second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine was given to the left arm but confirmed with CVS that it was given to the right arm.

I also had someone page mom because mom went shopping. When I went back out to see the boy, his mom was there and he was drinking some water. I came out to talk to mom. while I was there, the boy started to shake and complained of chill. He look pale, so, I went and called 911. They transfer me to the fire department. They said to have him stay where he is and not have anything to eat or drink just incase her may throw up.I told mom.  After that , I went about doing my things . Then emergency came . Then they all left. About 7 pm that day I called mom for follow up and she said he was doing ok.

The pharmacist told us to walk around the store for 15 minutes. 8 minutes after the vaccine, my son said his arm felt tingly. He immediately began sweating profusely and said that he felt dizzy. I made him sit down and he then said that he felt nauseous. Within 5 minutes of the onset of symptoms, he vomited. He was pale and his forehead was cold/clammy. The pharmacist said it was anxiety and nothing to be concerned about. However, my son said that he did not feel worried, anxious, etc. prior to or immediately following the vaccine.

He was also short of breath and the pain was worse when lying down. The day after the vaccine, he had fever and emesis, but that resolved within 24 hours. He was taken to  hospital where he was noted to have a troponin of 6.611, and CRP of 1.8. He was transferred to another Hospital for further care. He was treated with IV Toradol. He was seen by cardiology and infectious disease. He showed improvement with nothing more than NSAIDs, and since his MRI was normal, he was not given IVIG.

                                                While giving a Pfizer Covid vaccine today, a patient appeared to be fine but after a few minutes suddenly passed out and had a short 3-4 second seizure on the ground. He did hit his head and appeared to be hypoxic. We called 911 immediately and informed store management. The paramedics asked him to walk off on his own power, but they did offer to escort the family to Hospital which I believe was accepted. His mother and sister were present too.

                                                Patient presents to the ED with myocarditis s/p dose #2 of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.    From note: Patient is 13 yo M who was in his usual state of health prior to getting his Pzifer COVID-19 vaccine #2 on Saturday morning (6/5). Saturday night he began to feel fatigued with fevers as high as 102.8 F. These symptoms continued through the night and into Sunday morning when he had episodes of NBNB emesis. Sunday night he was actually feeling somewhat better and was able to sleep through the night. He stayed home from school on Monday due to fatigue. At 3 am this morning (6/8), he woke up with aching parasternal non-radiating chest pain that he describes as an 8/10 and worse while lying down. Denies SOB and heart palpitations. His parents took him to a hospital where he was found to have an elevated troponin (reported 5.84 - unknown scale) and Hct 28.8. There was also question of an abnormal EKG (?p wave inversion). He got a bedside echo which showed no pericardial effusion. Additional labs included: WBC nml, plt nml, MBCK 16.   In the ED, his vital signs have been stable. EKG was normal sinus. Trop elevated to 0.43 and echo was normal. Reassuringly his echo was normal, he has had no arrhythmias (after nearly 24hrs of continuous monitoring), his chest pain has largely resolved and his troponin has remained stable.

These events did resolve by June 9th when she called me however he still had a stomachache. I told her that these events would not be expected and that she needed to follow up with his primary care doctor. He received his first shot from us as well with no complaints

                                                Patient was examined by his pediatrician and cleared for physical exercise on 06/01/2021; 4 days before receiving his 1st COVID19 shot on 06/05/2021. On 06/07/2021 we dropped patient off at Soccer Camp. At 10am he started basic soccer ball control drills, which did not include rigorous exercise. At 10:30am we received a call from him, asking for us to pick him up as he had almost blacked out a few times.  We arrived at the sports field at 10:40am. I found patient to be red faced, sweaty, but cohesive. He described the following symptoms occurred during mild exercise: difficulty breathing, thirsty, fast heartbeat, &#34;black things&#34; over eyes, preventing clear vision, difficulty focusing, difficulty hearing, feeling faint  He took a water break and used his pro-air inhaler, as he thought he might have been having his 1st asthma attack (he&#39;s only ever presented with slight wheezing or night time cough). After a short break, his symptoms subsided, so he re-joined the group. After one more soccer drill, the symptoms came back again, but this time he experienced very hard palpitations and the feeling that his shoes were squeezing his feet. At that point he asked for permission to call to us and have us collect him.  We took him home and monitored him for a while. He seemed calm and symptom free. I had him shower and he was fine for the rest of the day.  The following day I had him jog on our treadmill for a period. He was symptom free. I increased inclination on the treadmill and he handled it ok without any of the previous symptoms. However, now realizing that he was within the 3 day window of his COVID shot, I decided not take him back to the soccer camp.   As of 06/13/2021 he has not complained of any symptoms returning. That said, he also has not performed any significant outdoor exercise since then either, besides walking.

                                                Patient received the vaccine 6/7 during the day, that evening into the next night he developed subjective fevers and chills. Overnight, he had several episodes of NBNB emesis and had some chest pain. By 6/9, his fevers, chills, and chest pain resolved. However on 6/10, he began having chest pain again; this pain was in the middle of his chest, without radiation. It was worse with laying flat and walking around. He went to his pediatrician, who obtained an EKG and checked some labs. Patient had an elevated troponin of 2.04, CKMB of 12, ESR of 31, and BNP of 39. His EKG was normal but he was directed t come to the emergency room for further workup. Repeat troponin that evening showed up trending troponin of 4.77 and patient was admitted for further workup and monitoring. His chest pain resolved and his troponin levels downtrended through the next day (4.77 -&gt; 2.3 -&gt; 0.4). Patient was monitored on telemetry and had no events of arrhythmia. Echocardiogram obtain did not show any evidence of decreased cardiac function. Patient was scheduled to under cardiac MRI (at this time, results of MRI are pending)

Continued to feel very fatigued. Three days after the vaccine, he started having chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion. He continued to be fatigued. Chest pain was intermittent. Saw pediatric cardiologist at outpatient appointment on 6/15/21 where he had a normal EKG and ECHO.  High sensitivity troponin on 6/15/21 was 0.08. He had a Holter monitor placed. He was asked to do activity while wearing Holter monitor and self-limit based on symptoms. He played basketball that night and had to press the Holter button 8 times while playing when he was experiencing chest pain. When he got home from practice, he felt weak and dizzy with associated chest pain. Mom notes his nails were blue/purple, and he was &#34;lethargic&#34; . Symptoms improved with ibuprofen. Patient did not want to  do usual activity, mom called cardiology who recommended going to ED. Patient has not had chest pain since coming home from practice on 6/15/21.  He was admitted to hospital on 6/16/21. Repeat high sensitivity troponin was 0.82 on 6/16/21 and repeated on 6/17/21 was 0.41. Cardiology consulted. Cardiac MRI performed with normal results. He was dizzy on 6/17/21 when he got up to use the restroom, self-resolved. Cardiology evaluated him and cleared him for discharge with outpatient follow-up and self-limitation with activity.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 13-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 28May2021 (at the age of 13-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EW0168) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 28May2021, the patient experienced nose bleeding. The mother asked if nose bleeding was common with age 13-year-old. The mother further stated, &#34;You tell whether it is normal or not. It was right after the shot.&#34; The outcome of the event was unknown.

The next day he was still sick, fainted again and hit his head, needed stitches next to his eye and had a mild concussion from it. He could have been blinded in that eye. This website was a goose chase to get to! There are probably tons of parents who can?t report the adverse reactions their kids are suffering because of how complicated it is to even figure out where to report it. You should be ashamed of this process which lends itself to the under reporting of adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccinations!

                                                On 6/11, he developed chest pain which began upon awakening.  During his evaluation in the ER that day, he was noted to have an elevated troponin level of 7.524, slightly elevated CRP level, normal D-dimer level, and otherwise, relatively unremarkable CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel.  A chest x-ray was described to be unremarkable. Echocardiogram revealed normal structure and function.   He was admitted and troponins were trended until 6/15. Therapy was initiated with Ketorolac every 6 hours.  Repeat troponin on 6/12 increased to 8.4, echo continued to be normal. Repeat troponin on 6/13 was 10.878. Troponin on 6/14 was 0.670 with continued normal EKG and Echo. On day of discharge, troponin had decreased to 0.110. Throughout admission, patient was monitored on telemetry and he remained in sinus rhythm without ectopy.  The day prior to discharge he was switched to Naproxen BID and will continued to be monitored closely for normalization of his troponin.

Patient didn&#39;t sit on regular chair to sit closer to sister and mom. After a few minutes patient got lightheaded and fainted falling back and to the right, hitting head against wall and blood pressure machine and floor. Mom and sister tried to catch patient during fall. Patient had light shaking for a few seconds before becoming conscious again. I went out and called 911 for paramedics, lifted patient legs up to improve blood flow to head. After a few minutes and after finishing call with 911 had other employees help lift child onto regular chair to sit. Patient got a small bottle of water to drink. Paramedics soon arrived after and evaluated patient. Paramedics determined child fine and mom decided to take child home. Called mom for follow up a few hours later and child doing fine per mom.

He woke up the next morning, 6/5/21, complaining that his chest hurt (with a stinging. constant pain), his heart was beating  rapidly, 102.5 degree fever, and he said it was hard to breathe. I gave him 200mg  Ibuprofen and he rested. Symptoms resolved in about 2-3 hours and did not return. I contacted the advice line at, and they set up a video appointment for mid afternoon on that same day, Saturday 6/5. By the time of the visit, symptoms were completely gone. PA recommended he have a Covid test as it was possible those symptoms were from having Covid ( coincidentally and simultaneously). The test was negative.

The patient I was counselling at the register happened to be a nurse.  She reached him first and assessed him for breathing and heart rate. He was not bleeding. We placed him in the recovery position.  The nurse noticed some firemen in the store and called them over. They did a basic assessment, but not a full write up.  After 10-15 minutes, he  felt well enough to sit up.  He remained seated for another 10-15 minutes.  He said his head hurt and was a 4 on a scale of 1-10. I told the patient&#39;s father to monitor his headache and if it gets very bad to seek medical attention.

Patient is a 13 year old male with a history of a neck dislocation who currently presents with 2 days of chest pain after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine. His first vaccine was on June 2, 2021. He tolerated that vaccine well except for some mild left arm pain where he received the vaccine. The second dose was on 6/24/2021 around 3 pm. He felt well that first day, but on 6/25/2021 he started to have achy chest pain when trying to go to sleep. The pain radiated to the left arm and severe. It was worse when lying flat. It prevented him from falling asleep at night. The following day he did okay and went about his normal day.

                                                Received vaccine in clinic room.  Eight minutes after receiving COVID-PFE vaccine, patient complained he was ready to go and felt drowsy.  The temperature did seem warm in the clinic room, so I escorted them 30 feet to the lobby.  As the patient passed through the door to the lobby, his gait, he seemed to lose his ability to remain upright and started to collapse.  I was able to catch him prior to hitting the floor.  He never lost consciousness, but we moved him into a clinic room to evaluate and further monitor him.  His blood pressure was a little low initially at 110/50, but came up to 112/60  (closer to his normal) after five to ten minutes.  His pulse was strong and regular.  We gave him a cool, wet compress to the forehead, cool water to drink, and chocolate candy.  He was able to answer questions appropriately.  We monitored him for another 30 minutes before releasing him. His mother was present with him and is a nurse practitioner.  I called the Mom on 6/22/21 (the day after the event).  She (Mom) reports the patient went home, laid down for about 45 minutes, then played video games.    I recommend she considers getting the second dose at either Hospital, so that a higher level of care is available if needed.

                                                Date of Admission: 6/19/2021 Date of Death: 6/20/2021  Primary Care Physician: No primary care provider on file.   REASON FOR ADMISSION: Patient is a 13-year-old previously healthy male who was admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ROSC after CPR for 15 minutes in the field, found to be in the context of large cerebellar hemorrhage secondary to brain lesion (AVM vs tumor).   BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITALIZATION: Patient was intubated prior to arrival to the ED. Upon arrival he was started on epinephrine and norepinephrine drips to maintain perfusion and was administered bicarbonate x2. Head CTA was obtained and was notable for midbrain hemorrhage and tonsillar herniation, and no contrast enhanced blood flow in the brain.   Brain death exams were completed at 09:59 and 14:20. APNEA test was performed at 13:30, which is the official time of brain death.  Official cause of death was brainstem herniation from intracranial hemorrhage.    Mechanical ventilation was continued to allow family time to grieve and perform last rites. Time of cardiac death after mechanical ventilation withdrawal was 18:36.     HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:   FEN/Renal/Endo:  #Central DI He received 1.5 L of normal saline bolus in the ED and an additional 3 L of ringers lactate bolus overnight in the ICU to maintain perfusion and decrease heart rate.  His sodium was 141 upon presentation but reached a maximum of 160 due to central diabetes insipidus. He was started on 0.45% normal saline at 100 mL/hr to improve hypernatremia, which was monitored Q1h until normonatremic.  He additionally required vasopressin drip to be started due to central DI, which was increased to a maximum of 20 mU/kg/hr.    CV: At time of admission, epinephrine was running at 0.1 mcg/kg/min and norepinephrine was 0.1 mcg/kg/hr. Norepinephrine was increased shortly thereafter to 0.12 mcg/kg/min.   In the morning after admission, he had tachycardia to the 190s, which appeared to be narrow complex. Epinephrine and norepinephrine were discontinued. Two doses of adenosine were administered (6 mg first dose, 12 mg second dose) due to suspected SVT. The rate decreased for ~4 seconds after the second dose however returned to ~180. EKG arrived which showed sinus tachycardia so no further medications or cardiac interventions were done.  Fluid rates were increased to 2x MIVF rate and additional 500 mL bolus of LR was administered.   Norepinephrine and epinephrine were restarted and escalated due to low blood pressures in the early afternoon.to allow family time with patient.  Both titrated to effect.   Pulm: Patient was mechanically ventilated to achieve normal pH, normocarbia, and high arterial oxygen tension per brain death protocol.  He had no primary pulmonary disease during this admission.   Neuro:  #Intraparenchymal hemorrhage #Tonsillar herniation Neurosurgery was consulted. Mannitol x1 and hypertonic saline 23% x1 were administered to decrease intracranial pressures. Keppra 2g was administered for seizure prophylaxis. No sedation was needed during patient&#39;s hospitalization.

A 13-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number and Expiration date and NDC number was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 09Jun2021 around 18:00 hours as dose 2, single (at the age of 13-years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing attention deficit disorder (was in fourth grade, around 4 years ago) and patient&#39;s sister also has autism spectrum and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and patient had seasonal allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Patient received no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medication(s) included atomoxetine hydrochloride (HCl) (was in fourth grade, around 4 years ago) taken for attention deficit disorder from an unspecified start date and ongoing; guanfacine HCl extended release (was around 3 years ago) taken for an unknown indication, from an unspecified start date and ongoing; montelukast (about 4 and a half years ago) taken for preventing seasonal allergies, from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number and Expiration date and NDC number was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 18May2021 (in the afternoon) as dose 1, single (at the age of 13-years-old) for covid-19 immunisation and was good after that. Mother stated that doctor, did not want patient to get the Covid vaccine. On 09Jun2021around 18:00 hours, patient had the second dose, and he was good for a few hours, but around 21:30 or 22:00 hours, patient started having a headache that night and headache was on and off. On 10Jun2021 (the next day), when patient woke up, he felt alright, but in the middle of the day around 15:00 hours, his blood pressure was 127/90 and his heart rate was 111 and he was feeling weird and needed to lay down and on the same day around 23:00 hours, events resolved completely. On Jun2021 (5 days after the vaccine), patient had local redness, where the vaccine was injected and also had a little bump/right arm, swelling, redness, rash, bump, at injection site and after he went out in the sun and went outside, the redness was circling his arm. Mother stated that patient did not tell her and then by Friday (11Jun2021), patient had a red rash, and she gave him antihistamine pills and pills helped a somewhat. Mother was not sure if the rash was from the heat or the sun. On 14Jun2021 in the morning, around 10:00 or 11:00 hours, patient had a big red circle, on his arm and it was persisting. Patient had no emergency room and physician office visit. No relevant tests were performed. The patient had not recovered from his arm had swelling and redness/Right arm, swelling, redness, rash, bump, at injection site, after second vaccine and recovered from other events.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                myocarditis; fever; ache; lethargy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s grandfather). A 13-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), first single dose and second single dose, both via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) for covid-19 immunisation at age of 13-year-old. Medical history concomitant medications were none. Caller stated that he was inquiring for his 13 years old grandson who was very healthy, active, athletic, on no medications, and with no medical problems. He went on to report that when he received the first dose of the vaccine he had a very strong response to it that included; fever, ache, lethargy, and more. When he had the second dose he had a very similar reaction but worse. He stated that the doctors were thinking that his symptoms could be related to possible myocarditis. The caller explained he was encouraged to call by the pediatrician. The caller reported that his grandson just had his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and with both doses he had, not a terrible one, but a reaction after both doses. His grandson was not on other medications or had any chronic conditions or acute conditions, he was healthy. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about batch/ lot number has been requested.

                                                13 year old who received his second Pfizer COVID vaccine on July 3, 2021 (3 days ago). He describes a low grade fever on the day after the vaccine which did not initially concern him.  He presented to the ER yesterday with complaints of midsternal chest pain and shortness of breath and a vague history of palpitations that started yesterday morning and continued to progress over the day.  The chest pain did not vary with position and was not aggravated with respiratory effort.   He had an elevated troponin and CRP and was admitted for management/observation. His chest pain has resolved since starting Ibuprofen (600 mg q 6 hours).  Serial troponins peaked at 22.9, now trending downward. Notable changes on serial EKG&#39;s with resolving ST segment elevation and T wave inversion. The echocardiogram showed low normal LV function but was otherwise normal.   PT presentation is consistent with the newly recognized post Covid vaccine myocarditis in adolescent males.  Timing of the chest pain in relation to the vaccine, EKG and echo findings and elevated troponins all support the presumed diagnosis of myocarditis.  He met the criteria for a cardiac MRI to be obtained prior to discharge- results pending.

They woke him up when he was sleeping and did not go away. Then, it continued through the next day and we asked our doctor if we needed to keep an eye on him because of all the reporting and stuff about the heart problems. They did a triage consult visit to see if it could be an adverse event from the vaccine. The course of action was to take 2 ibuprofen every 4 hours and use ice and heat to see if the pain improved to rule out musculoskeletal situations because that was what they thought it was. We did that for 2 days and then the pain moved to his back upper right quadrant and we noticed a rash all over his abdomen and we were not sure where he got that. Based on the fact that the pain moved the doctor was more confident that it was not an adverse event.

We asked about any other symptoms he was having and said he felt like his chest was heavier. I gave him a dose of Benadryl and told him he could take his mask off so it would be easier to breathe and told him to stay here for longer until he started to feel better and to let us know if he feels any different. after another 20 minutes he said he was feeling better and didn&#39;t have either of those symptoms anymore. We counseled on other symptoms to look out for and to let us know if anything else happens and to contact urgent care or his md if anything else happens. especially breathing issues. He left a few minutes later saying he was feeling better.

After the vaccine he was advised to sit for 15 minutes after the IMZ for observation. While I was administering a vaccine to another patient, his dad came running and said his son had a reaction and is having a hard time breathing. Right away I went out to check his condition and found that he was pale and was struggling to breathe lying on the floor. I told my technicians to call 911 and notify the store management . I knew it was time to administer the Epipen and I told his father I will administer it. I administered one Epipen at 4.08 pm, recorded the time and waited for the emergency personnel to show up . After the Epipen was administered Pt&#39;s situation became better . The emergency personnel took him out to monitor his vitals.

                                                We had a preventative EKG completed on 6/26/21 for a baseline before the vaccine as a precaution and I am happy to make these available to you.  Vaccine was 7/3/21. Patient started having body chills within 24-48 hours after the shot. He still has daily chills  as of 7/20/21.   Starting 7/13/21 Patient complained of chest tightness and &#34;pain&#34;, localized around the center of his chest and a little below. He has seasonal allergies, including a cough that started acting up 7/11/21.  The location of pain and description is significantly different than his normal allergy symptoms. Pain and tightness occurred with stationary activities and would come/go, regardless of whether he just coughed. He still has chest pain and occasional tightness as of 7/20/21. No breathing issues, fever, or other symptoms.

                                                Patient received his second dose of covid vaccine on 07/12/21.  He seemed fine and left our immunization area.  Approximately 5 minutes later, his brother came back to the pharmacy to inform us that the patient was sitting down near the restrooms and not feeling well.   I, along with another pharmacist, went to assess him.  He said he was lightheaded and was feeling nauseous.  We sat with him for approximately 10 minutes and checked his blood pressure twice.  His blood pressure was high the first time we took it, but it returned to normal after a few minutes when we took it the second time.   We subsequently found out from his mother that he fell/fainted in the restroom due to his dizziness.  He was unhurt from the fall.  After approximately 10 minutes he said he was feeling fine and was able to continue shopping with his mother.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

The Rph administering the vaccine moved in front of the patient and gently moved his head into an upright position. The patient had mild muscle spasms and twitches while passed out but when he regained consciousness he immediately began talking saying he was ok. Father came into the consultation room at that point and Rph explained what had occurred. Patient looked a little pale and eyes were having a hard time staying open so with the help of his dad Rph helped him down to the ground in the corner of the room so he could have back and head support from the wall. Patient was given a glucose tablet and water, and later orange juice. Patient stayed in the consultation room for about 20 minutes before leaving on his own and saying he was feeling much almost back to normal.

I heard a mom scream while I was giving another patient a vaccine. I ran out with an epipen but he was awake, alert, and breathing normally. I asked what happened and she said he fainted for a second and seized or twitched a little. I did not give him any epinephrine because he was not having any issues breathing and was able to tell me he felt fine. We did call 911 per moms request and they came and checked him out.

He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

He fell backward against a closed door and slid down.  He quickly regained consciousness and his vitals were stable.  within 10 minutes he was no longer dizzy or hot.  He was able to sit up right without issues.   Per dad, this is the same reaction he had to the flu vaccine in fall of 2020.

Patient stated that he started to have ringing in the ears and some blurred vision.  Patient&#39;s father instructed patient to lay down on the three chairs in vaccination waiting area.  At this time store employee came out to assist patient and patient&#39;s father.  I (employee) came out to assist moments later when I saw what was happening (I had just finished a consultation with another patient).   We elevated patient&#39;s legs, put and ice pack under his neck, and called 911.  Patient was awake but not very talkative. Patient was very alert and talkative in Clinical Service room at the time of immunization, which was a big change from how he was immediately after fainting. Patient appeared sweaty and pale in color.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was taken at 12:09 pm and was 88/51 pulse 53 (patient was still laying down at this time). Respiration rate was 20 breaths per minute.  At 12:12 pm blood pressure was taken again as patient appeared more responsive and talking more.  His BP was 101/63 and pulse 63.  Immediately after second blood pressure reading, EMS arrived and they took over.  Patient was responsive and drink water and sitting up at this point.  EMS checked patient out and was cleared shortly after.  EMS stated that this will not defer patient from getting his second COVID vaccination.  Before patient left he was continuing to drink water and was eating some crackers.

                                                Patient received 1st dose Pfizer COVID vaccine at a store/pharmacy on 5/25/21.  Presented to ED with chest pain on 5/28.  Diagnosed with myocarditis and admitted to the hospital.  ED attending note:  Patient presents with acute onset of chest discomfort in the sternal area 2 days after the first dose of Covid vaccine.  Patient&#39;s not had any fevers.  No respiratory symptoms.  No difficulty with respirations or any pleuritic chest pain.  Denies any cough.  No chest wall trauma.  No back pain.  No palpitations or syncope.  No orthostasis.  No peripheral edema.  On physical exam he was mildly tachycardic in the 80s to low 90s with no murmur and no gallop.  No JVD.  Clear lungs.  No rub.  Bedside ultrasound performed by HCP had bilateral lung sliding and normal gross function based on 2 views.  No pericardial effusion.  EKG had ST changes.  Chest x-ray was obtained without any effusions or pulmonary infiltrates.  Normal cardiac silhouette.  Troponin sent elevated.  Cardiology consulted for possible postvaccination myocarditis.  Child remained stable.  Resting heart rates in the 70s and low 80s.  Cardiology came to see the patient.  Plan to admit to cardiology service.  Presumed diagnosis of myocarditis.   Cardiology admitting note:  Pt. is an otherwise healthy 14yM who presents with acute onset atraumatic chest pain i/s/o recent covid vaccine, found to have mildly elevated inflammatory markers and troponin with borderline ST changes on EKG most consistent with mild peri/myocarditis at this time given overall well appearance on exam without hemodynamic or respiratory compromise and grossly normal function on POCUS, though plan for formal echo in AM. EKG w/ non-specific ST-T wave changes in precordial leads, no evidence of strain or block. Admitted to the cardiology service for serial troponins, ECHO, and close monitoring.  HPI per cardiology consult note:  &#34;Patient is a healthy 14 year old with a history of alopecia who presented to the ED with mild chest pain 4 days following his first Covid vaccine (Pfizer). He had no symptoms in the days immediately following vaccine, and played basketball the day following with no symptoms, but after waking up today began having dull mid sternal chest pain. It was a 4/10, worse with lying down, non pleuritic, not sharp, and not radiating pain and not associated with any other symptoms including SOB, numbness, GI pain, cough, or anything else. Has not taken any meds for the pain. Has not exercised today. Felt &#34;warm&#34; this AM, but didn&#39;t check temperature and felt better throughout the day. No palpitations, dizziness. Denies ever having chest pain before and no recent illnesses or sick contacts. No notable fhx of cardiac disease. In the ED, troponin mildly elevated to 0.12 ng/mL and CRP 5 with low ESR and BNP. Bedside point-of-care US reportedly showed no clear effusion with grossly normal function. HR mainly in 70s in ED and normotensive. EKG with borderline nonspecific ST elevation in V3-V6.&#34;

Mother mentioned that he has been complaining of intermittent midsternal chest pain that worsened after eating since the day prior to admission. She had been giving him peptobismol, thinking it was gas related pain. However, due to him persistently complaining of the pain after eating, she brought him to. She denied any fever, shortness of breath, weakness/fatigue. Of note, mother had COVID in march 2020 and she believed he might have been sick around that time as well.  Patient is still in the hospital and continues to receive pain medication and treatment for myocarditis  (NSAIDS and opioids)

                                                Client received his 1st Pfizer vaccination (Lot# EW0187, EXP 08/31/21) in his left arm at 19:15 from RN.  Client?s parents and sister were with him.  Client?s parents only spoke Spanish and an interpreter was present.  After receiving his shot, client sat in a chair next to his sister while RN administered a shot to her.  Five minutes later client stated he felt nauseous.  RN immediately called out to Vaccine Runner RN and Check-in Nurse who were in the hallway to get an EMT.  Check-in Nurse radioed for an EMT to come to station 3 while Vaccine Runner RN rushed to the EMT room to ensure an EMT got the call.  Check-in Nurse stayed with the client and placed a trash can next to him in case he vomited.  RN stated the client looked pale and clammy.  At 19:26 EMT1 arrived at station 3 and collected the client?s medical history.  Interpreter was also translating the EMT?s questions and statements to the client?s parents.  Client stated he had no known allergies, no underlying conditions, and is not currently taking any medications.  Client also stated he was not experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, or having trouble breathing.  EMT2 arrived at station 3 at 19:27 and brought the client a vomit bag.  The client had not vomited, but still felt nauseous.  EMT1 gave the client a bottle of water and juice,  and took client?s vitals at 19:28 (HR:  64, BP:  120/70).  Client stated he felt a lot better.  While walking out of station 5 Lead RN saw individuals grouped together at station 3 with the EMT and arrived at station 3 at 19:28. Lead RN was updated on client?s status.  Lead RN observed that the client was mildly pale and clammy and asked client?s mother if his current coloring was normal for the client.  Interpreter translated to both parents and client?s mother stated that the client did look a little pale.  Client stated he felt better and was just nervous about getting the shot.  At 19:30 Lead RN asked client to try and stand up. Once client was standing, Lead RN asked client if he felt dizzy and client stated no.  Client stated he felt just fine.  Lead RN and EMT?s directed the client to the observation room to sit in a zero-gravity chair for additional monitoring of 30 minutes.  EMTs walked the client and his family to the observation room and sat him in the zero-gravity chair.  Client stated he felt much better and at 19:47 EMT1 took client?s vitals (HR:  66, BP:  100/70, SpO2:  98).  EMT1 stated client?s color was returning.  EMT1 took client?s vitals again at 20:04 (HR:  67, BP:  104/78, SpO2:  99).  Lead RN arrived in observation room at 20:10 with Lead Ancillary to check on client who stood up and stated he felt good.  Lead RN observed that client was no longer pale or clammy.  Lead RN educated parents and client on potential side effects vs adverse effects of the vaccine.  Lead RN further instructed client and parents to see the client?s HCP or visit urgent care if client started to experience additional common side effects for more than 24-48 hours and to call 911 if the client began to experience trouble breathing, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  Lead Ancillary translated all the information to the client in Spanish.  Lead RN observed the client leaving with his family at 20:15. Client left walking with a steady gate.

After about 2 minutes they turned to walk away and he lost consciousness and hit his head on a counter. I unfortunately did not witness him falling. He regained consciousness almost immediately and I told him he needed to stay laying down for a few minutes first. After a few minutes he said he felt fine and we moved him to a chair. Within a few minutes, he became ill again so we had him lay down again in the consultation room. He then laid there for about 15 minutes before we moved him to a chair. He stated that before he lost consciousness his heart was racing. His mother states he&#39;s never had any problems with vaccinations in the past. After sitting for the second time he said he felt fine except where he hit his head which was a little sore. We contacted the father later that night and he said that he too had a similar episode with a needle stick a few years prior. The patient felt better later night per his father.

A few minutes later in the waiting area he started feeling ill and his mom had him sit down and she called 911.  He complained of weakness, diminished sight and hearing and lightheadedness.  He was very pale and sweaty.  With his mom&#39;s permission I activated an ammonia inhalant near his nose.  He said he felt better after the 2nd sniff.  After a couple minutes he said his symptoms were greatly diminished and he was ok.  The paramedics arrived and pt was able to walk to the ambulance for further evaluation.  A paramedic came back and said the patient is feeling much better and declined to go to the hospital.  I talked to the mom a couple hours later and she said he is all better.

After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

Called 911 and they were able to decrease the hyperventilation through slowed box breathing. They stayed for about 30 minutes as the heat rate slowly decreased to just over 100 bmp on 13May2021. Two other incidents of increased heat rate have happened since in May2021. Events were resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. Since the vaccination, patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events included hydroxyzine prescribed to induce calming effect as.

                                                14yo male that was admitted to our hospital&#39;s cardiology service prior to after an episode of acute onset tachycardia (possible atrial tachycardia), dizziness, headache at school.  He had his first covid vaccine 8 days prior to the event at school.  He has a coincidental diagnosis of an anomalous left coronary off the right aortic valve cusps, but his coronary course is unusual where he would be very unlikely to be at risk for sudden cardiac arrest.  He had an ECHO in the ED that showed a mild left ventricular dysfunction (EF 45%).  He underwent a cardiac MRI on 5/28/2021 was done that was normal without myocardial edema or scarring.  His ejection fraction on that study (24 hours later) was 54%.  He was discharged home and had a stress test the following week (6/1/2021) that showed blocked PACs at peak exercise (a very usual finding for an otherwise healthy kid) and possible slow atrial tachycardia at baseline.  His laboratory evaluation including CRP and ESR was normal.  72 hour Holter monitor showed blocked PACs and no supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia.  Mother reports that he is &#34;back to baseline&#34; May 31st.    Of note, his father was covid positive with headache in October 2020.  The patient also had a headache for 1 week without fever.  It was presumed that he had covid as well, but was not tested per PCP recommendation.

Patient was nervous about getting vaccine.  We called 911, emergency services came, did a work up.  It appeared to be a vagal response, possibly from fear of needles.  When emergency services got patient up he seemed a little nauseous.  They took him to hospital.

                                                Sudden chest pain, about 30 hours after the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Described as an intense, clawing sensation inside the chess. Diminished upon calm, deep breathing, but persisted on-and-off for about an hour, until patient fell asleep. A few hours later, at night, woke up with a sensation of an electrical streak across his chest and back. It diminished/disappeared quickly. Some remnants in the morning. No problems reported afterwards.

                                                This patient received their second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 6/4/2021.  The patient began experiencing arm pain which migrated to his chest on 6/6/2021.  The pain resolved but returned with increased severity on 6/7/2021, prompting medical evaluation.  The pain was described as a pressure sensation in the center of the chest and in bilateral arms.  Upon initial evaluation, he was found to have an abnormal EKG with ST segment changes.  Troponin was significantly elevated.  He was transferred to the hospital.  A transthoracic echo was obtained and was normal.  He was hospitalized on the pediatric cardiology service, admitted on 6/8/2021.  Troponin trended down during his stay. He was started on lisinopril.  He was discharged home on 6/9/2021 with plan for outpatient pediatric cardiology follow up.  Given the proximity of his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to onset of his symptoms, and given similar reported events, the chief concern is whether his episode of myocarditis is related to administration of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  I was on call as attending physician when this patient was admitted.  Physician cared for this patient as the pediatric cardiology inpatient attending during his hospital course.

Pain is central, to the right of the sternum, without radiation. The pain then became more dull, aching, and has been interfering with his sleep. It does seem to be worse when he is thinking about it, better when he is distracted. He went to basketball tryouts 6/15 and the pain has been more frequent since that episode of strenuous exercise. He has not taken anything for the pain. He also notes more frequent fatigue. He denies any prior covid infection. No recent illness or sick contacts. Denies cough, fever, GI upset, diarrhea. He is going to school in-person, they all wear masks.

Initially after the vaccine he had some generalized fatigue and nausea but yesterday started experiencing some chest tightness lasting up to 4 minutes.  He also feels an irregular heart rate or like his heart is bounding.  He also had some generalized bilateral neck stiffness.  This is all resolved currently.  He did vomit 1 to 2 hours ago.  No fevers or chills.  No cough or cold symptoms. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with ST 1 box upsloping elevation V3 through V6.  Initial troponin is elevated at 2.6.  Attempted to consult  cardiologist  and they recommended pediatric cardiology consultation.  Spoke with Dr. .  She recommended admission with trending troponins and Motrin.  She says they typically do echocardiogram and if normal then cardiac MRI.  Spoke with Dr.  in the  ER and they graciously accept patient in transfer.

A 14-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 intramuscular on 26May2021 (Lot Number: EW0197) at the age of 14-year-old as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Autism, asthma and COVID-19 which was diagnosed prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  The patient experienced pericarditis/myocarditis with &#34;SOB&#34; and Chest pain and troponins as high as 25 and BNP of 150s. All the events occurred on 27May2021 with outcome of not recovered. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19  IgM (Nasal Swab): negative on 29May2021, COVID-19 IgG (Blood test) positive on 29May2021. The patient received NSAIDS and Opioids as treatment.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported events and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. There is limited information  available, which precludes a more meaningful assessment. The case will be assessed further upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

                                                Mother of adolescent PT came back to the pharmacy with her daughter to receive daughters 2nd dose and reported her son had chest pain the day after receiving the pfizer vaccine. PT received the Pfizer vaccine on 5/30/21. The mom reported taking PT to ER on 5/31/21 where he was then referred to the PCP who then referred them to a cardiologist. At the ER PT was reported to have elevated blood pressure. Mom reported the physicians told her the chest pain was most likely due to administration of the Pfizer vaccine. Mom was advised to monitor PT&#39;s BP. Since seeing the cardiologist he no longer has chest pain. They have also been monitoring his BP since ER visit at home and reported today 6/20/21 he no longer has elevated BP.

                                                Exactly one week after the 2nd shot, patient was at a track meet and suddenly had a sharp pain in his chest.  It hurt when he inhaled, and he didn&#39;t compete.  He has never experienced this kind of chest pain before.  We thought it was an allergic reaction (hayfever?) because it seemed harder to breathe, so we gave him a benadryl and later went home.  He was tired and took a long nap.  Later he felt better.  But it was scary.  I think he underreported how he felt, to not alarm us parents.  He admits this now. There&#39;s not logical cause other than the vaccine ( no new foods, medications, experiences).  However, he didn&#39;t have any other notable side effects from the 1st or 2nd dose, except tiredness and arm soreness the first days.

During that wait time patient started to develop blurred vision, and the pharmacist was alerted that the patient fell on the way to the bathroom.  Patient was then guided into the immunization room when he briefly lost consciousness. While patient was seated, pharmacist assessed for anaphylaxis reaction and contacted emergency services. Blood pressure was taken and noted to be elevated, other symptoms included blurred vision and sweating.  Patient denied itching, swelling, or trouble breathing. Patient did not receive epi-pen and was assessed by emergency services.  Patient recovered shortly after emergency services arrived, no further services were needed

                                                Patient is a previously healthy 15 year-old presenting with chest pain and elevated troponin in the setting of recently receiving his second COVID vaccine.   He was in his USOH and received his second COVID vaccine 6/17. He subsequently experienced tactile fevers, headache, and malaise for two days that resolved. Then 6/21 he developed congestion and chest pain. It is in the center of his chest, not pleuritic but worsened with sneezing/coughing. Tylenol/Motrin help, but given persistence of the pain he presented to the hospital ED.   Lyme titers were sent, troponin at 1814 was 2.12, then at 1646 2.49 (normal &lt;0.06), chem was normal, CBC had wbc 11.5 with 66% neut and Hgb 12.3. EKG and CXR were reportedly normal. He received Tylenol and Ativan and was transferred for further management.   In the ED, he was afebrile with normal VS. Repeat troponin was 0.25. EKG was normal. Given elevated troponin, he is being admitted for further workup and serial cardiac enzymes and EKG.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for troponin and chest pain monitoring. His troponin levels were trended x4 and showed return to normal. Just prior to discharge, troponin level was 0.04 (normal &lt; 0.09). His EKG was normal throughout, and at discharge showed normal sinus rhythm. He did not have any chest pain prior to leaving the hospital. On discharge, he was tolerating a normal diet. Plan for return was discussed with family for cardiac MR on 6/25. Return precautions were discussed and family expressed understanding.

                                                Patient received the vaccine. He stated he felt fine-not dizzy/etc     He stood up and I walked him to the vaccination waiting area. Myself as well as 2 of my technicians checked in on him for  a total of 3 checks. He was waiting for another person to get their vaccination. Upon checking in on the other person (he was still sitting in the waiting area) I asked him how he was feeling. Approximately  25 min had elapsed. He said his throat felt weird like closing. I had him remove his mask immediately. I assisted him to the immunization booth. He was able to walk on his own. I observed him. He said it felt the same maybe a little worse. No other signs of allergic reaction. Technician called 911. He said he was not dizzy and his color was normal. His blood pressure was slightly elevated. He said he had to keep yawning and felt tired and his throat seemed to be getting worse. I administered an epipen and immediately afterwards the paramedics were there. He walked to the stretcher and they took him to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                My son experienced severe bruising about one week later after receiving his Pfizer vaccine. My son right arm was very sore as well. He also had little bumps, petichae all over his body.  He still has the bruising and he had a sore, scab where he fell down before the vaccine and he could not stop the bleeding at the site. I took him to ER, performed a complete blood work and platelet count. On 06-22-2021, his platelet count had dropped to 15,000.  The ER did not admit him and we had to go back to the ER last Thursday 06-24-2021 and his platelet count 13,000.

I made an appointment with his pediatrician. Dr. exam didn&#39;t find irregularities but he ordered tests to be certain and to rule out the myocarditis being reported. Chest X-Ray and EKG were normal. The Echocardiogram showed mild TR but no other diagnoses. This was patients first echocardiogram, so there was no baseline to compare to.

                                                1 week after receiving vaccine #2, PT complained of fatigue and. Started getting lightheaded with standing  and walking. Day 11 after the vaccine  he complained of chest pain, so I took in to the ED at Hospital. His EKG, CXR, tropinin, CK,BNP were  normal but he was orthostatic by heart rate.  He followed up with Dr. and he recommended push fluids, more salt/Gatorade.  He has continued to have orthostatic tachycardia and when he walks household distances his HR goes up to 120-140. He is lightheaded with minimal exertion. Climbing one flight of stairs makes him short of breath. He has an appointment with Dr. tomorrow, 7-5 and I will request more labs and cardiology referral.  PT was in good shape and played basketball before the vaccine.

                                                Myocarditis; Her son still has some inflammation; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other hcp (Patients mother). A 14-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Batch/Lot Number: EW0180 and Expiry Date: 19Jun2021), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Jun2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.

                                                Patient reports onset of chest pain three days after his second Pfizer COVID vaccine. In the following three days after his vaccine, he had headache, decreased appetite, and mild nausea. However was still taking in fluids, decreased solid food intake. He also experienced insomnia and generalized malaise. At midnight on 07/02 he began to experience 9/10 substernal chest pain that was sharp, burning in sensation and located in the middle of the chest, non-radiating, pleuritic which lasted for several hours. Patient has had no fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, congestion, sore throat or cough. Denies any  SOB, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, edema, orthopnea. There has been no trauma to the chest. No recent URIs. He was seen at a hospital where he was found to have a trop of 1251 ng/L (converting to ~1.5 in our system) then one hour later up to 1500mg/L. His EKG at the hospital demonstrated lateral ST elevations. Had a normal CXR. He was given Maalox which was not helpful. He was transferred to another medical facility after 3 hours at the hospital.   Upon presentation to the emergency department, his vitals were stable. He had elevated CRP to 7.69, troponin was 1.0. CBC and Chem were normal. BNP normal at 15. Bedside ultrasound showed no pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted and ECHO showed mild left ventricular dysfunction with EF 47%. Repeat EKG here showed ongoing ST elevations in lateral leads, though mild. His pain has since improved to a 2/10. He has not required any medication for his pain. He is COVID/flu/RSV negative.   On arrival to the floor, his chest pain had completely resolved. Patient reports the pain was pleuritic, worse with exertion and improving on rest.   PMH: idiopathic urticaria  Allergies: NKDA  Family history: none reported, no cardiac disease or sudden cardiac death  Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 2 doses. He initially had some very mild chest discomfort that improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which showed improvement in his EF to 54%. Given his dysfunction, he was started on Enalapril 2.5mg twice daily. He was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were trending down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional PVCs but no arrhythmias. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.  By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.

                                                Prior to administration of the vaccine, I discussed with mom and patient about previous  immunizations and the YES response to previously fainting or felt dizzy post immunization.  Mom proceeded to state that he has a strong vaso-vagal response to needles/immunizations and he has fainted multiple times during and after immunizations.  The patient appeared calm, so I did some breathing exercises with him and when I determined that he was calm, I administered the vaccine.  Patient was still sitting upright, I asked him to continue to breathe slowly and deeply. I asked if he would like a water, and so I went to grab it from the pharmacy lab.  Patient then stated he was dizzy and was going to pass out.  He did not pass out, and I asked him if he would like to lay down. I put down a towel for him and then he started to throw up. I got a cold washcloth for his neck.  He started sweating profusely (essentially a marked cholinergic response).  I got him to lay down after some more vomiting . He stated that his vision was blurry, but he was laying down calmly.  after 25 minutes of reclining, he stated he was starting to feel a bit better. I offered a 25mg diphenhydramine tablet to help with residual nausea. He stated he was better and go shop with his family.  They did not return to the pharmacy, so as of my last interaction, he was fully recovered from the event.

He went to stand by her and 3-4 minutes later patient had a syncopal episode, fell back, and hit his head on a wall.  The patient had recovered consciousness by the time staff reached him. Our staff came to his aid and had him sit up, assessed for any signs of bleeding, which there were not, and checked vitals (results below).  Patient had no complaints of headache, no dizziness, was alert and oriented (was able to repeat name, DOB, address, and where he was), no nausea, no neck or back pain, just mentioned that he was standing then everything went dark.  He mentioned that his left arm was tingling and sore but nothing he would be alarmed about.  At the time, we suggested we monitor him an additional 15 minutes and for him to inform us if he felt any additional side effects.  At approximately 3:55pm, patient mentioned that his hands felt cold, but otherwise he had feeling and no numbness.  Patient mom was concerned and agreed to call emergency services.  Ambulance arrived and took patient to hospital at approximately 4:09pm.

During his doctor?s exam they noticed something with his breathing that led to an EKG, which came back abnormal. They ran additional X-rays and lab work to confirm he needed to be referred to a cardiologist. Patient has past health issues and has never had Covid. He is extremely healthy and doesn?t take any medications. His weight is healthy. He is physically fit and exercises on a regular basis. Doctor suspects pericarditis related to vaccine.

                                                Massive nose bleeds; Headache almost every day; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (mother reporting for son). A 14-year-old male received BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- EWO177) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Jun2021 as dose 2, single (at the age of 14-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Patient medical history included known allergies. The concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride tablet (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) at a dose and frequency of 10 mg, 1 tablet as needed for allergies, vitamins NOS (FLINTSTONES) at a dose and frequency of 1x/day (2 gummies once a day). Mother stated he takes ZYRTEC the generic kind.  He had been taking it since he was six about, on and off with allergies. He started taking flintstone vitamins last year for health. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number-EWO177) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 01Jun2021 as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization. Mother was calling about the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine and wanted to report a side-effect her son had after second dose. She added they just got back from doctor office. This all happened after the second vaccination, ever since he got the second one on 22Jun2021. He has had headache almost every day since then. He had massive nose bleeds this week on Tuesday and Wednesday. After the first vaccine he had a headache for a few days also but it was not bad at all.  After the second, it was constant. It did not last all day, it came and went. She was unable to answer if symptoms were still going on and stated they come and go. The nose bleeds he has not had any today so far. They took some blood they are checking, including his clotting platelets or whatever that is, and they are checking to see if he has been bit by a tick.  Just for precautionary reasons.  She does not know results yet as he just got the blood today and they just got back from the doctor. When the headaches got bad, he would take Tylenol the first few days and then he took Motrin. She corrected and stated he took Ibuprofen, not Motrin. The adverse events did not result in emergency room visit but resulted in physician office visit. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Then on May 19 at 1400 the school nurse called me to say that he had developed a nose bleed.  No injury/no inciting event.  They had been putting pressure, ice, etc on it for about 2 hours.  We picked him up.  No more nose bleeding after the initial pressure/rhinorocket and he did not go to the Emergency Room.  The congestion, cough improved.  No problems with the second dose of the vaccine on June 5.   Since then, he has complained about things tasting funny/bad and not being able to smell as well.  He did not mention this to his primary care doctor during his physical this summer nor did his father let her know (he was at the visit with our son).  has complained of this fairly regularly and he relates it back to the nose bleed.

The patient did not injure himself with falling to the floor and woke up immediately after he passed out. We immediately put ice packs on him and had him drink a bottle of water while sitting on the floor and made him stay in the waiting area until his color came back in his face and felt fine to go home. He was extremely nervous about getting the vaccine.

EMS arrived and monitored him. father and EMS made decision to return pt to home.

Per vaccinator,  reports that client was saying, &#34;Wow that was aniclimactic&#34; after getting vaccine. Per vaccinator, she notices within 1-2 minutes client got quiet and then reported &#34;I am not feeling well.&#34;  Client received vaccine in left deltoid. RN requested PHN 1 to get gravity chair.  PHN grabbed gravity chair and asked RN to get BP cuff and pulse ox. PHN arrive to assess client and found client alert and oriented x 4 in chair at 5:53PM. Client was already drinking water given by vaccinator when PHN arrived.  Client reports he was experiencing &#34;dizziness and slight shortness of breath.&#34; PHN ask client if he thought he was steady enough to switch to gravity chair. Client stood up slowly and sat in the gravity chair. RN 1 asked client if his throat felt tight-client responds-&#34;No&#34; and coached client to take deep, slow breaths.  At 5:55PM vitals are: blood pressure: 130/90, pulse: 55 and oxygen: 98%.  At 5:57pm client reports no longer feeling shortness of breath.  Client is speaking in full sentences and able to answer all PHN questions about chest pain and headache and client reports having neither. At 6pm vitals: blood pressure:125/90, pulse:75, and oxygen:100%. PHN instruct RN to get Lead PHN  or Co-Lead.

At 6:03PM vitals are: blood pressure:160/100, client appears pale and heart rate:140, and oxygen: 100%.  Lead PHN  arrives to take over assessment and PHN starts calling 9-1-1 at 6:04PM as blood pressure is repeated by co-lead :180/90, oxygen100% and pulse 129 and upon auscultation hears clear lungs and heart palpitations.   Client is then reports shortness of breath and dizziness, no headache and no blurred vision.  Parent reports that client has a history of asthma but rarely needs inhaler so she does not have it on her and that client recently had been on antibiotics for Gastrointestinal history and a bad cough (not COVID)-all symptoms had been resolved before receiving vaccine.  At 6:07pm Vitals: blood pressure: 170/90, pulse:100%; no change in symptoms.  At 6:08pm vitals: blood pressure:170/90, pulse: 94, and oxygen: 100%, client reports experiencing tightness in chest and unable to complete breath. Client reports no chest pain.

                                                Myocarditis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 15-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW1077), at the age of 15 years old, intramuscularly on 17May2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was reported as none. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with covid-19 prior to vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The patient experienced myocarditis on 21May2021. The event resulted in hospitalization for 2 days. The patient was currently still in hospital. The patient had been tested for covid-19 since the vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included covid-19 test: negative on 22May2021 by nasal swab. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of myocarditis and included treatment with analgesic. The outcome of event was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the even onset.  More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

We took him to the local hospital and after examination they said the blood work and ekg was fine so they released him. We are at home now and he feels the pain still if he pauses his breath, and he just showed me you can hear a very strange sound coming from his heart as it beats. I can hear it sitting near him a loud pumping or squirting sound in there as his heart pumps! Never heard anything like that before coming from someone?s chest!

                                                This information was reported to this writer. Immediately after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the patient reported a &#34;weird sensation&#34; in his chest. The patient became pale, and reported nausea and lightheadedness.  According to the vaccinator it seemed as though the patient went into a syncopal episode. A nurse attempted to do a sternal rub to wake the patient up but was unsuccessful. The patient was then laid onto the ground and woke up; attempted to sit patient up and then went into another syncopal like episode. EMTs were notified and were on their way  to attend to the patient. Patient&#39;s feet were elevated. No history of vaccine reaction. Patient had eaten and had fluids 2 hours prior to the vaccine. Patient was sat up again with assistance but immediately felt lightheaded and had another syncopal like episode. He was again placed in a supine position with feet elevated. Immediately reported improvement of symptoms. Patient had several sips of juice and was placed on  a stretcher and taken to a back room. Patient had mom and sister at his side. As the patient remained in supine position, he denied nausea and lightheadedness; no chest pain, no dizziness. Patient was alert and oriented. Remained pale in color according to his father who just arrived. Per the advice of the EMTs, patient was transferred to hospital per ambulance.

EKG showing ST elevation and troponin of 3.75.  Given dose of 30mg Toradol and pain resolved.  Started on Motrin q6h, trending troponins. In the morning pain much improved, but still with pain on deep inspiration relieved with leaning forward.  Repeat EKG shows diffuse ST elevation, consistent with presumptive diagnosis of myopericarditis. Repeat troponin at 9am of 9.3, BNP of 197.  Echo done wnl.  Scheduled for cardiac MRI with contrast per cardiology recommendation to r/o myocardial edema. Viral panel sent to r/o viral etiology despite no prior symptoms.

                                                Likely myocarditis s/p 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine.  From hospital note: Pt was in his usual state of health when he received the second dose of Pfizer mRNA Covid vaccine on 6/3.  On 6/6, he developed substernal nonradiating chest pain, as well as low-grade temperature to 99.6.  Pain persisted, so he presented to the emergency department on 6/6.  He did not have respiratory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctival injection, new rashes.  In the emergency department he was afebrile with normal vital signs.  Laboratory evaluation in the ED demonstrated WBC 7.45 (N 64, L 19), Hb 14.5, PLT 191, ESR 10, CRP 0.69, AST 46, ALT 14.  BNP 23.  He was noted to have a troponin leak (troponin T 0.55).  Covid PCR and antibody testing were negative.  An EKG demonstrated early repolarization but was otherwise normal.  An echo demonstrated mildly dilated LV with good systolic function. Pt was admitted to the cardiology service for further evaluation and management of myocarditis.  Following admission he remained afebrile with stable vital signs, but continued to have troponin leak.  He was initiated on methylprednisolone 30 mg IV every 12 hours, and IVIG 2g/kg x1.    Pt is a 15 year old with what appears to be myocarditis after the SARS_CoV2, with significant troponin elevation, coming down, chest pain, improved with IVIG and steroids, and ibuprofen prn. Plan for cMRI to look for late gadolinium enhancement to guide course of therapy.

At 1:00am on 6/8/21 he was struggling to breathe due to pain in the center of his chest upon inhalation. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before. His chest pain was worse lying down and he could not lie down or sleep and wanted to stay standing on his feet. He felt pain in both forearms too. He was crying from the pain and the difficulty of breathing, and was very tired but unable to recline in order to sleep. I called the advice nurse, who checked with the doctor on call at his pediatrician?s office, and she told us to go to the ER due to concern it may be myocarditis or pericarditis.

Five minutes after his injection with the COVID-19 vaccine he felt hot, nauseated, vomited a small amount of yellow emesis twice and became pale.  He continued to sit up in the chair and a cool cloth was placed on the back on his neck and a fan was turned on.   He was alert throughout.  His BP was checked 4 minutes after the event and read 92/60 with a pulse of 74.  He denied feeling lightheaded.  He sat in the lobby with father by side and health department nurses monitoring him for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes pt gets up out of chair without difficulty and ambulates around the lobby with steady gait and denies lightheadedness, nausea/vomiting or shortness of breath.  Leaves accompanied by father.  Encouraged to push fluid, stay out of the heat today and to take it easy the rest of the day.   Checked on pt by phone through the father and he related that pt was feeling much better, denies symptoms.

Clinical course details was reported as: She thinks he has developed myocarditis. Experienced shortness of breath, went to the Emergency Department. She wishes for him to receive second dose. &#34;They did a bunch of tests&#34;. Saturday he had to rush in to the hospital because his chest was hurting, he has chest pain on Saturday that&#39;s why he went to the emergency room. The doctor said, he had inflammation of the muscle in his heart that was caused by COVID vaccine, she wants to submit that to Pfizer.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;No, not exactly, he got the COVID vaccine on May 13th. He started developing shortness of breath and tight chest on Saturday night which is May 15th, I woke him up  because all night long he was complaining, I take him to the emergency room at the morning like 4:30 am, 4:30 in the morning of May 16th. The doctor told me that, he said that he didn&#39;t believe that it was a side effect of a vaccine because it was not, it didn&#39;t developed like within 1 or 4 hours to the vaccine like now when I&#39;ve seen on the news that the inflammation that is happening to some kind on the heart, he matches all the symptoms of that. So I need to know what do I need to make and what do we do for the second dose?&#34; Lab test: They did when he was in the hospital, When he was in the hospital 2 days after they did a bunch of lab test.&#34; Treatment: They did give him some medication in the hospital. The notes from the hospital they gave, they says he has tachycardia, hypertension, shortness of breath, chest pain. They gave him Ativan. Caller states she is calling about the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine and states she is thinking her son had the side effect that is being reported of myocarditis and took the 1st dose of the vaccine on 13May2021 and on 15May2021, at night he complained of shortness of breath, and a very heavy chest and moaned all night long; states at 4:00am she and her husband got up and took the patient&#39;s blood pressure and oxygen level and pulse and his blood pressure was elevated at 151/108, oxygen levels were ok at 96-97 and his pulse was 128, and his temperature was 99.7 she thinks. States they took him to the emergency room at that time because they did not know if something was going on with his blood pressure elevated. Caller states she has not reported this information to the patient&#39;s HCP and is calling to ask if she should wait or have to wait on the patient&#39;s 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine. Caller states she did previously file this report but was not given a report reference number and had to call back to ask for her questions. States the patient&#39;s 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine is scheduled for 04Jun2021. States given that they did not expect the patient to have any side effects and they do not want to be in this situation and are planning on traveling the day the patient is scheduled for his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine would they have to wait for his 2nd dose; states she wants to do things the proper way.

Pfizer is aware of the observations of myocarditis that occurred predominantly in a population of young men who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Adverse events are regularly and thoroughly reviewed and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established. There is no evidence at this time to conclude that myocarditis is a risk associated with the use of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. More than 260 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally. Serious adverse events unrelated to, but close in timing to vaccination, are expected to occur at a similar rate in vaccinated individuals as they would in the overall population. [for non-HCPs]: we refer you to your healthcare provider to discuss this topic. Your healthcare provider knows your medical history, can discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and can provide vaccination  recommendations to you. Pfizer is aware of the reports of myocarditis in recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. More than 260 million people globally have now been vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established. Serious adverse events unrelated to but close in timing to vaccination will likely occur at a similar rate in vaccinated individuals as they would in the overall population. With a vast number of people vaccinated to date, the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive. If asked on the specific casesMore specific information on the specific cases or demographics are not currently available to Pfizer Medical Information. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

He was sitting with his brother for the 15 minute wait period when his brother called for help. I told my staff to call 911. Pt had his head back and his legs outstretched in front of him. He was unresponsive at first and pale. Then he sat upright and said he thought he had just hallucinated. He was distraught and did not understand what had just happened to him. I asked the brother if an adult was with them. He called for his mom and she suggested we lay patient down on the floor. She sat with him until EMS arrived.

He was also running a fever. Called the advice line for his dr and were told to monitor him. Saturday early morning, took him to urgent care due to no improvement.

A few minutes after receiving the vaccine and sitting in the observation area, the patient&#39;s father told the nurse that his son was feeling lightheaded, was sweating and appeared pale. EMTs were notified and approached the patient. The patient was laid onto the ground and his legs were elevated. EMTs did an assessment and vital signs. Reported that the patient was hypotensive. Dad stated that his son had not eaten anything yet today. He was then given juice and a small candy bar which he ate. Patient was soon transferred to a wheelchair and taken to a nearby cot to lay down again. Dad stated this son does not have any allergies. Dad remained at son&#39;s side until released to go home by EMS. Patient ambulated unassisted toward the car.

                                                PT had his first dose of Pfizer vaccine at 5pm on 21st. He looked low energy at night. We felt his forehead and he was warmer than usual. However, thermometer did not show he had a fever. He looked much better in the morning on 22nd. We thought that was it.  Only after a week did PT tell us he had more reaction. However, because he was well then, we did not pay too much attention. When we learned of the link between Covid 19 vaccine and Myocarditis, we asked him in detail again. Here are his responses.  He started feeling his throat hurt when he had dinner that around 7pm. It lasted only that night.  He started feeling chest pain around dinner time too. It only hurt when he moved. That chest pain lasted longer and disappeared on the 23rd.  He started feeling there were air bubbles under his skin on the flat part of his left shoulder (above the injection site and below his neck) on the 22nd. He did not see them. He just felt them. When he pressed them with fingers, he felt them popping. This feeling lasted for a total of three days. He could feel the amount of air bubbles become less over the three days.   We have not seen any side effect in the news like his. We are not sure that he should get his second dose. Please someone could advise us, please send us an email. Much appreciated.

Rph and intern giving vaccine where both in the immunization room along with the dad.  Rph counseled patient on what to do if feeling light headed and to help prevent fainting . Intern gave vaccine and within a few seconds he said it was getting dark and so immediately as the patient was sitting down I grabbed him gently from the front and his dad came and held him from behind. We both supported him as he was sitting down and within 10 seconds he came back and was fine.  We then moved him to the floor lifted his legs and supported his head and he remained there for about  20 minutes. He then sat up slowly and we monitored him sitting for another10 minutes. He we doing well. My intern then proceeded to help his dad walk them out to the car. The dad did NOT want us to call paramedics as this was a known issues with his son fainting after getting immunizations. Made a follow up phone call with patient after about an hour and half and dad said he was doing great.

                                                This is a 15 year old male without PMHx  who presents with chest pain for one day after having Pfizer COVID vaccine 2-3 days prior. As per father patient had first dose without any sx except mild soreness on the site of injection. On 6/9/21 he received the second shot of Pfizer vaccine. That day he only fell mild pain on site of infection only. Next day he suffered from chills, HA, and fever. He took Tylenol for it. The day prior admission he had a mild headache and pain on the middle of the chest, dull, not radiating, and on/off. There was one episode of emesis after dinner and after taking TUMS he went to sleep. The parents check on him through the night and upon waking up he complaint still with chest pain, now increased and radiating to left side of the chest. The parents decided to bring him to ED for evaluation where he was found to have elevated troponins and he was admitted for myocarditis likely secondary to the Pfizer vaccine.  His troponins were monitored q8hrs and he was started on Toradol q6hrs. See EKG and Echo results below. Due to increasing troponins 6/13, he was given IVIG with resulting improvement. At this time, we are still monitoring his troponin inpatient with plan for potential cardiac MRI. He will be discharged home on Ibuprofen 600mg TID and follow up with cardiology with exercise restriction likely for a few months, tbd by outpatient cardiology follow up.

                                                Fifteen hours after the vaccine my son woke up and his respiratory rate was high. It was over 140. I woke him up and he had chills and diarrhea. Because of his Cortisol Deficiency I called his doctor. I was advised to give him 30mg Hydrocortisone and lots of water.  His Respiratory and heart rate were high. He was feeling a little short of breath and he had heart palpitations. We went to the ER and they did lots of testing. He had a fever and Sepsis testing. All results were normal and they gave him a Liter of fluids. He was discharged after two hours and his pulse was still high at 105-110. We monitored him and his heart rate was slowing and he started to feel better. His Endocrinologist had him take a double dose of Hydrocortisone the next day. His improvement progressed and by the fourth day the symptoms were gone.  He was able to do his normal activities but tired and worn out from the ordeal. One week later he had a slightly elevated heart rate but it resolved quickly.  He had had a local reaction in his arm with swelling and a rash after the first vaccine.

We left facility and my son was saying in the car that he felt very tired and wanted to go home and go to bed.  As soon as we got home, he was walking toward his bedroom and he say &#34;whoa&#34; and then fell to his knees as I caught him and fainted.  He was passed out for a few seconds.  I called 911 immediately  and then he came to and said &#34;what happened&#34;.  Fire Dept. took blood pressure, which was 152/74 and heart rate at 136.  They said his heart rate was fast.  I drove him to ER at and he had a very fast heart rate, around 150 -170.  He was able to go home around 10pm after the negative tests and heart rate coming down to 80-90s for a short time, but still would get high. My son kept saying he felt fine even after passing out and at the ER. He did not feel  like he had a fast heart rate.  ER recommended purchase a pulse oxi meter to test heart rate at home, which I purchased the next day and he&#39;s been in the normal range.  He is scheduled to take the 2nd dose June 18th, but I will not let him get it since he had a severe reaction to the 1st dose.

He fell on carpet but we did not know he passed out.   He was out for about 1 1/2 hours before he woke up, found himself on the floor, and came back to the room to let us know.

The day following vaccine he developed fevers and chills which she treated with Tylenol.  On the morning of June 12 he developed chest pain and nausea which progressively worsened throughout the day.  That day he presented to an outside hospital emergency department where he was found to have elevated troponin and EKG with ST segment elevation.  He was then transferred to the hospital pediatric ICU for further care.  On admission to the PICU treatment was started with IV Toradol.  Echocardiogram was performed and revealed mildly decreased left ventricular systolic function.  His peak troponin level was 27.43.  He remains hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the pediatric floor.  By 6/14/2021 his chest pain had resolved and he continued to improve with NSAID therapy alone.  His troponin down trended to 2.62 on day of discharge.  Repeat echo on day of discharge showed improving but still mildly diminished systolic function.  Repeat ECG at discharge showed persistent ST elevation. He was discharged with a prescription to continue ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times daily and follow-up with pediatric cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks.

                                                Pt was feeling tired, sweating, and was pale after 15 minutes post vaccination. EpiPen was not used but an ambulance was called. While waiting he was given Gatorade and an ice pack. He laid on the ground and sat back up. Ambulance took his vitals and stated everything was normal. They concluded that he might have been nervous for the vaccine and recommended to follow up with his PCP.

                                                Patient is a healthy 15 year old male presenting with chest pain in the setting of recent SARS-CoV2 vaccination. He was in his usual state of health until he received the second dose of the Pfizer/BNT SARS-CoV2 vaccination on Thursday 6/10. Shortly after and into the following day, he developed fatigue, chills, and a headache, which resolved within 24 hours. However, early this morning at around 2am, he awoke with sharp central chest pain associated with some shortness of breath, radiating to his left, prompting him to present to the ED.  Initially presented to Hospital ED. Vitals stable. Labs notable for troponin 0.07 and d-dimer 1.48. EKG with sinus rhythm, ST elevation in inferior leads. Given ibuprofen 600mg and contacted Cardiology, who recommended transfer to another ED for echocardiogram and further evaluation.  Here in the ED, vital stable, exam non-focal. Labs notable for troponin 0.13 and CRP 3.0; CBC, chem 10, LFTs, BNP, all within normal limits. CXR normal. Echo done which showed normal function (prelim read). Seen by ID who recommended standard workup for vaccine-induced myocarditis. He was admitted to the floor in stable condition.  Hospital Course: Due to rising troponin during hospital day 1 (peak 0.23), patient was treated with IVIG 2 g/kg (6/14) and methylprednisone 30 mg BID (6/14 - 6/15). On 6/15 a cardiac MRI was obtained that showed a small area of late gadolinium enhancement of the LV with normal function.  Troponin was trended every 12 hours and had decreased to 0.11 on 6/15 AM. He was transitioned to oral prednisone 30 mg BID to complete a total steroid course of 5 days (6/14 - 6/18). During admission he was found to be EBV PCR positive with all other viral testing including EBV serologies pending. It is still thought this is likely due to post-vaccine inflammation and not viral myocarditis but serologies should be followed up as outpatient.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.   Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  Prednisone for myocarditis  Famotidine for stomach protection while on prednisone  Discharged home with follow up tests scheduled for 6/17/21.

Patient&#39;s mother called for help after the patient lost consciousness and fell, hitting his head on a shelf on the way to the floor at approximately 1:15pm.  By the time we arrived, the patient was seated but slumped against his mother.  He was extremely pale but conscious.  We applied an ice pack to the back of his neck.

                                                Patient received second COVID vaccine on 6/4.  Chest pain developed on 6/6.  He presented to hospital where EKG showed ST segment changes and troponin was elevated.  he was transferred to our facility.  In our emergency department his EKG was abnormal.  His troponin was elevated, along with CRP, AST, and ALT.  An echocardiogram on 6/7 showed moderately depressed LV systolic function (EF = 34%).  He was admitted to the pediatric cardiology service.  His picture was felt to be consistent with myopericarditis.  During admission, he was treated with NSAIDs and lisinopril was initiated.  Repeated echo on 6/9 showed normal LV systolic function.  he was discharged home on 6/9 on ibuprofen and lisinopril with plan for pediatric cardiology follow up in 4-6 weeks.  Given proximity of patient&#39;s onset of symptoms to the second Pfizer vaccine, and given similar cases reported in the literature, the chief concern is whether this patient&#39;s symptoms were related to the second Pfizer COVID vaccine.  Please note, I did not care for this patient, but am reporting this case on behalf of the attending physician who cared for this patient while he was hospitalized.

Deep breath aggravates the pain. The patient could not fall asleep. He had a light fever at the night of vaccination day but the fever was gone before the chest pain.  Single lead ECG with Watch has been measured and sent to a friend of the parents&#39; who is a physian, and no abnormal sign was shown from ECG. 400 mg Advil (ibuprofen) was given in the coming morning around 7 AM and the patient was able to fall asleep and symptons were gradually relieved. Another two doses of 200 mg Advil were given with six hours apart on the same day. The pain was gone by the following morning (i.e., June 11th) and no ibuprofen has been given afterwards. We suspect that this is related to myocarditis or pericarditis.  This was the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. There was no symptons for adverse effect after the first dose.

                                                15 yo male with myocarditis following 2nd dose of pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  He reports that he received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 6/16/21. In the 1-2 days following the vaccine he experienced fatigue, body aches, and fever to Tmax 101F. Family treated this with anti-pyretics. On 6/18 he started having a pain in his left chest. He was again febrile at that time. On the day of admission his chest pain was worse and he was experiencing pain all over his body.   He was noted to be tachycardic in the ED. His initial labs showed a modestly elevated BNP to 593 with a markedly elevated troponin to 1233. CRP was mildly elevated at 3.8. Electrolytes were unremarkable as were LFTs. CBC w/ diff showed an absolute lymphopenia with ALC of 1000 but was otherwise unremarkable. D-Dimer was normal. He was admitted initially to hospital medicine and then was transferred to the ICU due to concern for risk of developing a cardiac arrhythmia. An echocardiogram done showed trace mitral regurgitation but was otherwise normal with normal LV function. CXR was fairly unremarkable. Coags are normal. Repeat electrolytes showed a slight bump in his creatinine. LFTs largely unchaged and procalcitonin of 0.16.    He does have a past medical history of PCR proven COVID-19 disease in December 2020.

Elevated troponin levels peaked 9.12 on 06/06/21, but on discharge decreased to 0.51.  Pleuritic pain was also improved on 6/8.  Echo demonstrated mild tricuspid valve insufficiency and trivial pulmonary valve insufficiency, but otherwise normal function.  EKG on 06/06 with nonspecific T-wave abnormality, likely related to myocarditis.  Follow EKG was stabel from 6/6. Cardiac MRI was read preliminarily and had evidence of edema, but good LV function and an LVEF of 61%.

                                                Patient felt like he was having an asthma attack on the night of the 21st when playing outside with friends (running and climbing). He has never had asthma, but said his chest was tight and it was hard to breathe. He said when he stopped and sat for a while it seemed to get better. He went to sleep at about 2am and woke me up at 5:20am crying. His chest hurt really bad and the pain was traveling down his arm. When we took his blood pressure at home it was 205/125 and his heart rate was 112. We went to the emergency room at hospital immediately. Once there they did an EKG. The doctor said there was not reason to be alarmed, but the EKG showed signs of possible pericarditis. They then took blood work, a urine sample, an xray and did an echocardiogram. The doctor told us that the blood work did not show any signs of an actual heart attack or any damage done to the heart. She said the echocardiogram showed some fluid build up in the pericardia sac surrounding his heart. She said this is considered pericardia. She mentioned that some young men are having this happen after being vaccinated. She said we seem to have caught it early. They gave him Tordal through his IV when we were there and that took his pain away. We were told to follow up with a cardiologist within 24-48 hours. We have an appointment at Hospital tomorrow at 10:45am.

Evaluated at local ED, found to have an elevated troponin to 12 and ST elevation in anterolat leads by report  on EKG. An ECHO was obtained and revealed decreased EF to 47% and he was transferred to our hospital,  initially monitored with telemetry, troponin levels every 6 hours and started on scheduled ibuprofen.  Troponin peaked at 22.82 first hospital night on 6/18, then down-trending. Telemetry was without any ectopy. Symptoms improved and hemodynamically stable throughout his PICU course.  Transferred to the pediatric floor on 6/19, continued to do well. Discharged on 6/20 with troponin of 5.92 ng/mL and EF of 55-60% on ECHO.

                                                Immediately following the vaccination, the patient told his father he felt dizzy, so he was directed to a chair.  He told his father he could not see anything and was experiencing vertigo.  His father then said his eyes and lips on the left side of his face seemed to be shaking as if he was having a seizure and he lost consciousness for a brief moment.  When he opened his eyes, he told his father he was dizzy and his head hurt, but he could see again.  I brought the patient some water to drink and took his first blood pressure reading at 10:42 am, which read 67/31, pulse 43.  The patient mentioned that he hadn&#39;t eaten anything that day and that he was extremely nervous about getting the vaccination.  His father got some orange juice and started to give him sips of it and he remained seated.  The next blood pressure reading at 10:54 am was 115/59, pulse 76.  The patient said that he was feeling nauseous, but less dizzy.  I gave him two cookies to eat and took his blood pressure again at 11:01 am and it read 117/73, pulse 88.  At this point, the patient said he was feeling much better and the cookies even made the nausea go away.  The final blood pressure reading was at 11:13 am:  122/63, pulse 76.  At this point, the said he felt completely better and father was confident in taking him home, so they left.  I followed up with the father two days later on 6/25/21 and he said that he didn?t have any more problems after they left the store.  That evening, patient&#39;s temperature went up to 99 and his head hurt with movement, but otherwise, he was fine and did not have any more symptoms after that.

A 15-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EW0178) via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Jun2021 (at the age of 15 years old) as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the Pharmacy or drug store. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Any other medications that the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination was not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EW0176) on 16May2021. On 08Jun2021, it was reported that the patient experienced chest pain with elevated troponin which was treated with IVIG and ketorolac. Suspect myocarditis was also reported. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are possible. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the events chest pain with elevated troponin, Suspect myocarditis  onset.  More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Vasovagal  symptoms and near syncopal episode.  Was able to get him to the floor to avoid a fall.  Vomited several times.  Severe vasovagal symptoms began to resolve within one hour.  Didn?t check heart rate during initial near syncopal episode but was tachycardic after initial stabilization.  Headache and fatigue persisted and is still lingering today.

Throughout the night his heart rate was very erratic, reaching as high as 138 and he had palpitations.  The symptoms resolved by the next morning.  There were no other adverse outcomes.  I was not aware of the heart rate and palpitations until a few days later when he showed me the data from the night of the vaccine on his  fitbit heart rate tracker.  Since the symptoms had already resolved, I did not bring him to the doctor for any testing.

                                                Pt had general malaise and headache that same afternoon. The next day his symptoms progressed to dull, burning chest pain that radiated to the throat and ears along with numbness and tingling of the distal arms and hands. The chest pain was relieved by leaning forward. This continued off and on for two to three days while being monitored in the hospital. The diagnosis was myocarditis due to the vaccination.

                                                15 yo M with no PMH p/w 1 day of chest pain and elevated troponin and lateral ST segment elevations.  On Wednesday 6/30 he had his second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. There after he had headache, tactile fever, fatigue and myalgias which resolved by Friday 7/2. On Friday at midnight, he awoke with 7/10 sharp substernal chest pain, non radiating. No recent trauma to the chest. He took Tylenol at home which did not relieve the pain.  No recent URI sx over the last month. The last time he remembers having URI sx was 1.5 years ago. He does endorse &#34;one or two sneezes&#34; over the past month, which he attributes to allergies.  Today 7/3, he presented to urgent care center where he got an EKG, which was concerning for ST elevations. He was given ASA which did not relieve the pain. He was sent to hospital for further work up where he had a Troponin to 1.59, CRP to 36, AST to 79, ALT to 64, Alkphos to 74, BNP to 119, ESR to 10, and WBC to 13.4.  EKG showed ST elevation in I, II, precordial leads V4 V5 V6. CXR wnl. He was given IV toradol at hospital, which alleviated his CP. He was transferred to ED for further evaluation.  On arrival to the ED on 7/3, he was HDS afebrile, with BP 111/69, HR of 80, and satting 100% on RA. His CP had resolved to a level of 0/10. Additional labs were obtained including repeat CBC (with WBC 10K, Hgb of 14), normal ESR of 20, normal D-dimer of less than 0.27, BMP wnl, elevated LFTs with AST 103, ALT of 61, elevated LDH to 293, normal GGT and alk phos, normal BNP to 28, elevated CRP to 3, and an extremely elevated troponin of 3.15. NP swab for COID, Influenza A/B, and RSV were negative. CXR wnl but did note findings consistent with degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 8 doses. His chest discomfort improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which did not show any cardiac dysfunction. His troponin downtrended while on IV steroids, therefore he was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were continuing to trend down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional NSVTs/PVCs; he was started on Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily to prevent arrhythmias after discharge. He was discharged home with a Holter monitor to be worn for 4 days. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.   Of note, CXR from 7/3 with incidental findings suspicious for degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine. This should be followed  by his primary care physician as an out patient.   Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  - Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily (for prevention of NSVT)  - Prednisone 30mg BID (myocarditis)  - Famotidine 20mg daily (while on steroids)  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued equipment: NA   Relevant Diagnostic Images/Studies:  Cardiac MRI (7/7): ?

                                                Patient admitted fur to chest pain and dyspnea and found to have myopericarditis after 2nd dose of COVID-19 Pzifer vaccine. Vaccine was administered at pharmacy.  First dose received on 5/15/2021, second dose on 6/5/2021. Fatigue and chills started a few hours after second dose and then developed shortness of breath, nausea, emesis and 8/10 midsternal chest pain. Presented to an urgent care facility where CXR and EKG were obtained. EKG showed early repolarizations. Labs were obtained at a local ED and showed elevated troponins, initially 11k and then to 20k and peaked there. BNP was within normal limits. Subsequent EKG showed diffuse ST-segment elevations concerning for acute pericarditis. No prior infections or symptoms like this previously. He was given colchicine at outside facility prior to transfer. At hospital he was continued on ibuprofen and monitored with telemetry and had ECHO and cardiac MRI. Latter was consistent with myopericarditis. ECHO showed normal function. He received PPI while on NSAIDs. His symptoms resolved and he was discharged to home on 6/10/2021 with activity restrictions and plan to follow-up with peds cardiology. Of note, there was an error submitting the initial VAERS report for this patient during the admission, therefore, this delayed report is being submitted.

We slowed his descent, but he had a small abrasion on his head (I think from the carpet).  He said he felt dizzy and nauseous.  I&#39;m  not sure if he was also watching while I was giving his sibling the shot and  that exacerbated the situation. We had him checked out by EMT and he was fine after the initial fainting.

                                                Patient presented to the ED with 10/10 chest pain.  Two days prior, he&#39;d gotten his second COVID-19 pfizer vaccine.  He denied any fever, congestion, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, or other signs of infection recently; no sick contacts.  On arrival to the ED, he had normal vital signs,  but physical exam was notable for sternal/epigastric pain. Laboratory evaluation, including CBC, CMP, CRP, urinalysis, urine culture, high sensitivity troponins, and lipase were obtained and notable for HS troponin of 303 pg/mL with a 2 hour repeat of 291 pg/mL. CRP was 3.5 mg/dL. His EKG had diffuse ST elevations. CXR was obtained with no evidence of cardiac border or consolidation. RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of cholecystitis or other abnormality. Patient was admitted for presumed COVID-19  vaccine-induced myopericarditis. Echocardiogram showed  normal biventricular function and no pericardial infusion. He was treated with IV toradol, with resolution of chest pain. HS troponins reached the 400s, with downtrend to the 300s prior to discharge. He was discharged on PO ibuprofen with follow-up  cardiac MRI and labs.

                                                On June 2, 2021, he awoke and complained of feeling hot, tired, and not hungry. His mother had been sick with acute gastroenteritis symptoms 2 days earlier. Over the course of the day, he had a fever to 101.6 F, and began to have loose stools (twice). He received Ibuprofen 400 mg by mouth every 6 hours for the fever, and drank plenty of fluids. On June 3, 2021, he continued to have fevers to 101.5 F, loose stools (twice again), and poor oral intake of food. I canceled his scheduled 2nd Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and got him a NP swab test for SARS-CoV-2 through the health department. On June 4, 2021, he had no fever but now complained of a rubbing left parasternal chest pain. On physical examination, his BP was elevated (130s/90s), he had a slight tachycardia (90s), and was afebrile. On auscultation, I heard a S4 gallop and took him immediately to the local ER.

                                                Patient had a vagal response caused by an anxiety attack due to fear of needles. Technician, gave the vaccine and then immediately called me in. The mother and son were worried about the needle disappearing due to the retraction mechanism. The son was loosing color in his face and becoming dizzy. I had him sit upright, talked with him for a few minutes, gave him Benadryl as a precaution, and checked his blood pressure. He was having no difficulty breathing and blood pressure was WNL. His mother said that he has passed out with needles before and that he had not eaten today. Eventually the patient claimed to lose his sight, and within 30s passed out. He was still sitting in the chair, bent over, vomited, and then immediately came back to consciousness. The patient then said that he felt fine and wanted to leave. I talked with him and his mother for around 20 minutes, had him eat a banana, and drink a full bottle of water. After the time, he felt fine and him and his mother left.

                                                Patient presented 3 weeks after the vaccine with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, cough that began 2 days after vaccine administration. Two days prior to presentation to Harbor ER on 7/1/2021 he had nausea and  vomiting with a fever 101F on day of presentation. He was found to be in congestive heart failure with severely diminished biventricular function. While inpatient he had worsening respiratory status requiring CPAP and O2 though he improved with initiation of diuresis.  His inflammatory markers were not elevated and he had negative troponins. cMRI revealed an LVEF 13% with no signs of active myocarditis. Viral studies were negative and there was no evidence of bacterial infection. Prior to this, he was in his USOH with no limitations. He was seen in cardiology clinic 5/2021 and was stable at that time.  He required initiation of diuretics and oral heart failure management and was discharged with close follow-up.

A 15-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0173 F) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 07Jun2021 as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing known allergy in mosquito bite (sketter syndrome) an allergic reaction to mosquito bites, as his son has grown up it has become less and less relevant. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Dose:01 Lot number: EW0171 Anatomical Location: Arm left) on 17May2021 for COVID-19 immunization. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, was the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient been tested for COVID-19. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations dates of birth or immunizations are not available. It was reported that my son traveled on 16May2021. Covid test prior traveling negative. On Jun2021, 4 days after vaccination develop GI, heavier insomia, dierrea, vomiting, fever, hypotensive, dehydraeted. On 11Jun2021 experienced pericardial effusion. On an unknown date Jun2021, developed into MISC and was intubated. The patient was hospitalized from 14 Jun 2021 to 6 Jul 2021. Treatment was received. On 15Jun2021, admission at (withheld), (Hidratation IV and IVIGs). On 16Jun2021 condition worsen and Intubated in (withheld). On 17Jun2021, transfer to (withheld) (7 days at PICU, another 7 at pediatrics). On Jun2021, developed a strong insomnia and headache. Events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse event was MISC protocol IVIGsAnakinra, esteroids and others. On an unknown date, Patient said he had 4 vaccines. His son spent 7 days in the ICU and 7 days in the pediatric unit was discharged from the hospital yesterday. Reported that other researchers studying MIS-C in children have seen how the epithelium cells in the intestine become loose, then the protein goes through the blood stream and can start a cytokine storm and asked if we have studies regarding how much S protein is being produced by different age groups; can it be checked how much S protein is going into the bloodstream to see adverse effects of the vaccine and stated he needs more data to see if his son was possibly infected with Covid during his vaccination period or what he previously infected and absolutely asymptomatic. Most MIS-C occurs 4-6 weeks after having Covid. States that for his son to travel he had to have antigen testing, which was negative. His son did well until 3-4 days after the second shot. States at that time his son became ill with vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and insomnia. She took her son to the hospital and they found him to be hypotensive and dehydrated. They started intravenous fluids and their protocols; the hospital did not have all the required medications for their son and recommended he be transferred to (withheld) Hospital. He was very tired and they decided to put him on ventilation for the ambulance drive. States that when they arrived in (withheld), his son was placed in ICU where he was on the ventilator for 5 days, the recuperating for 2 more days. His son was then moved throughout the hospital system until his discharge yesterday. His son&#39;s insomnia may have started before he left for the (withheld). States that it was worsened after the vaccine, his son mentioned after his hospitalization that he was actually given 4 shots the day he got his vaccines, assumed it to be some kind of delirium from his son being in the ICU for so long, stated he told his son that was not possible that he got 4 vaccines at once because of the paperwork you have to fill out to get the vaccine, the lady at the vaccination site told him to sit down and then gave shothim four shots. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included IgG and IgM resulted as positive on 15Jun2021, PCR resulted as negative on 15Jun2021 Nasal Swab, PCR resulted as positive on 17Jun2021 Nasal Swab. The clinical outcome of the event developed MIS-C and was intubated, vomiting, dierrea, headache, insomnia, hypotensive, dehydrated on an unknown date 2021 was resolved and the event pericardial effusion, develop GI, fever was resolving, the event condition worsen, Vaccination failure, patient said he had 4 vaccines and PCR resulted as positive on 17Jun2021 Nasal Swab was unknown; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, the causal association between the event Insomnia, Diarrhea, vomiting, fever, Drug ineffective, COVID-19, Headache, overdose and the suspect drug cannot be excluded. Also, there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the event Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, Pericardial effusion, Gastrointestinal inflammation, Condition worsened, Hypotensive, Dehydration and the suspect drug cannot be excluded.

Workup notable for CXR (wnl), EKG (wnl), CRP (2.2), ESR (29), proBNP (62 wnl). Lipase (wnl), Lithium 0.8 (0.6-1.2 mmol/L). CMP 142/3.9/106/27. BUN 12, Cr 0.75. Dexi 120. Upon arrival to our ED, he reports 1/10 chest pain. He denies any SOB, difficulty breathing, palpations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.    He received his second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on 7/19 and has had low grade fever (Tmax 100.5F), myalgias, tiredness, and headache since then. He reports that his chest feels slightly tight, but denies any SOB. Assessment: Patient is a 15 y.o. male presenting with acute onset of chest pain and elevated troponin. Workup has been extensive and including BNP, repeat troponin, EKG, CXR, and echocardiogram. He does not show evidence of severe myocarditis or pericarditis. Assessment by cardiology suggested that mild myocarditdis in the setting of recent COVID-19 vaccination and acute heart strain/troponin leak in the setting of acute pain&#34;

                                                Patient is a 15 year old M with hypofibrinogenemia, platelet aggregation disorder and history of COVID admitted to Inpatient Ward from 26 June - 01 July for work-up and management of new onset and severe headache, photophobia, and pain with extraocular movement. Extensive work-up complete but still unclear etiology, though near complete resolution of symptoms with IV steroids.   Neuro: CSF positive for HHV-6, still unclear if this fully explains presentation. CT and brain MRI negative, though limited exam due to braces artifact. Headache complicated by clear post-LP postural headache, though this improved throughout hospitalization, with nausea moderately controlled on Benadryl. Neurology and Ophthalmology consulted, who both thought peri-neuritis was plausible, which is consistent given such rapid improvement with steroids. Pain moderately controlled with Tylenol. Oligoclonal bands and MBP CSF studies pending at time of discharge. Plan for 7-day steroid taper as an outpatient (outlined below in patient instructions), and Neurology follow-up in about 1 month.  ID: Initially empirically covered with Ceftriaxone and Acyclovir, but once negative CSF, both were discontinued. He remained afebrile throughout remainder of hospitalization, so no further antibiotics started. Had remote history of immunodeficiency (confirmed here to be IgA deficiency), underwent more extensive immune work-up with lymphocyte subset 6 pending at time of discharge.   Fen/GI: Nausea and poor PO intake secondary to headache and neurologic symptoms. Unremarkable KUB with no focal findings on exam. Tolerated good liquid PO intake prior to discharge, improving food intake with help of Benadryl and Reglan (Zofran did not help his nausea). Given risk of Reglan side effects, trial of Benadryl alone was given and relieved his nausea.  Will discharge with Benadryl PRN for nausea, though expect this to improve.    Heme: No blood transfusions required, no history of recent bleeding/trauma, no signs of active bleeding. Received TXA for three days following his LP performed on 6/28.  Rheumatology: Patient has preexisting appointment with Rheumatology scheduled on 7/9 due to a history of intermittent joint pain/swelling with skin color changes since April 2020. Ordered requested Rheumatology labs by Doctor while patient is admitted. CRP and ESR resulted normal at 0.31 and 8 (respectively), C3 and C4 within normal limits, dsDNA and ANA negative. Repeat ESR on 6/30 also normal at 10. Pending labs include fecal procalcitonin. Follow up appointment with Rheumatology on 7/9.   CV: Some concern for myocarditis at time of presentation given pleuritic chest pain, history of COVID-19 infection, and recent COVID-19 vaccination. EKG at that time revealed nonspecific T wave changes. However, troponin and BNP resulted negative and patient&#39;s chest pain has resolved at this time. Discussed with Cardiology who did not think further work-up was necessary. Chest pain completely resolved at time of discharge.

I do not want to give him his 2nd shot if this is his reaction to the first one.  He said he felt worse then when he had COVID.  But the effects of his heart really worries me.
