And because of this he was little pale in color and he had no local reaction to the vaccine on his arm and he was communicating with us. we did call the ems services and they took him  to the ambulance and per father he was let go after some time in the ambulance once he felt better.

She sail he had seizures when he was younger and had been on medication, but he was no longer on any medication and had been seizure free for approximately 5 years.

                                                From ED Note: 12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.   Mom notes that he was in his usual state of health when he presented to COVID clinic to get his first vaccine. He got the Pfizer vaccine, seconds after getting in his left arm, mom noted that he looked very &#34;wide eyed&#34; and distraught.  She notes that he slumped forward and had lost consciousness for approximately 5 seconds.  She noticed shaking movements in his right arm and bilateral lower legs.  She notes that his left arm was against her and therefore cannot comment on it.  She notes that his eyes were closed.  No tongue biting and no incontinence.  No secondary trauma.  She notes that when these 5 seconds were over he then had a period for about 30 minutes where he looked pale and was breathing heavy but was alert and answering questions.  She notes that he has had presyncopal episodes and episodes of feeling faint when getting flu shots in the past.  However, this time she noted that he had shaking which made her nervous for possible seizure activity.  Patient denies any chest pain or headache prior to the symptoms.  She came via ambulance for further evaluation.   On arrival, he reports that he feels 90% back to his baseline.  He notes that he does not feel quite ready to run around yet however denies any pains or discomforts, headache, weakness, numbness, or tingling.   He had eaten a full breakfast prior to getting the shot.  He had a normal night sleep and a normal day yesterday per mom.   Medical History: as above  Surgical history: none Family History: Reviewed and no pertinent related family hx pertaining to this visit Social History: Lives with family  Allergies: food allergies  Medications: flovent, epi-pen Immunizations: Up to date  Medical Decision Making  12 year old male with PMH of asthma on flovent, food allergies with epi-pen (has not required this) and pre-syncope/syncope who presents with concern for loss of consciousness and possible seizure-like activity following a COVID vaccine.  On arrival, he was alert, well-appearing, in no acute distress.  His vital signs were normal for age on room air.  His physical exam was very reassuring as above with a normal neurologic and cardiac evaluation.   Differential includes vasovagal/syncope in the setting of a known stressful trigger vs seizure given report of shaking in his extremities.  We feel the latter is significantly less likely given the timeline of the events.  Has no known seizure activity nor any triggers per history (fever, trauma, etc.).  He also has a normal neurologic assessment. At this time we will defer neurology consults given low concern for seizure.  It is possible that this represents a side effect of the vaccine however we also feel that this is less likely given the fact that his symptoms have been seconds after receiving the vaccine.  Nonetheless we reported the symptoms to the pharmacist who recorded it in the database.  We attained an EKG showing a known incomplete right bundle branch block (unchanged from 2013) and a slightly prolonged QTC of 477 (previously 451).    I encourage patient to stay well-hydrated, well rested in the setting of his suspected syncopal episode this morning.  I also suggested that for further vaccinations, that he lay down on the table and drink/eat well prior.  We provided strict return to ED criteria in the setting of worsening symptoms. All questions were answered at the time of discharge. Mom verbalized her understanding and agreement of the plan. He was discharged in a stable condition with mom at side.    **After patient was discharged, cardiology called the follow-up team due to the prolonged QTC to ensure that we were aware.  I contacted the patient&#39;s PCP to do a follow-up EKG in 1 month&#39;s time.

I (pharmacist) was alerted to the event and I and couple technicians went out to assist patient.  I elevated child&#39;s feet,  supported head, took blood pressure and pulse. Child regained consciousness and was able to respond to name in less than two minutes. Child stated that he was hot and agreed to drinking cold water. I also applied cold compress to child&#39;s forehead and wrists. Child took sips of water and BP was continuously monitored. Parents stated that child looked much better and had regained color to his face. Child was monitored to 30 mins by the pharmacy team with no event before parents took child home.

                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

                                                My son developed a  fever,  brain fog,  and his legs felt like they were burning. More worrisome was the heart pain he woke up with in the middle of the night and throughout the day on 5/20. He complained of a sharp stabbing pain on left side of his chest and said it was hard to take a deep breath. I gave him ibuprofen and he rested. I called his doctor and they said not to worry, these side effects were normal. I?m a bit nervous for him to get the second vaccine  since he had the chest pain side effects as to why I?m reporting this. I?m surprised they give the same dose to a 80lb child, they do to a 200 lb grown man.

Once I got to the patient he had come to, mom said he was out for about 10-15 seconds max and patient says he did hit his head. Oxygen saturation was 99% on RA, heart rate was 62bpm. BP 110/78. Patient was alert and oriented once I was assessing him. He was able to sit up in the floor about 5 minutes after coming to. He was able to drink water and the PCT had placed cool wet paper towels on his head and neck area. We provided the patient crackers and the management team was available. The patient said he felt like his stomach was upset and did not want the crackers. I suggested he go to the ER and mom said she would drive him and asked if this was caused by the vaccine itself. I explained what could have occurred and educated them on where he hit his head he needs to go to the ER to be assessed. Mom agreed and the manager got a wheelchair from the front of the store and mom drove him to the ER. I called report to ER.

                                                Significant chest pain started around 10 pm. He indicated it was sharp and intense and seemed to have some difficulty breathing at first. For the first 30 seconds the open mouth struggling look for breath had me thinking he was choking. Breathing improved but chest pain stayed intense for about 20 minutes. He went to sleep and the next morning said ?it kind of hurt but not much?. After the morning of May 23rd he hasn?t reported any other pain.

                                                Patient started to develop a cough on the second day of the vaccine around 6 pm. The cough was accompanied by shortness of breath, given his asthma we assumed this was some asthma related reaction to the vaccine. Nonetheless, that evening he started to complain about chest pain every time he laid back on his bed. This symptom is not common in previous asthma attacks. Sitting up alleviated the symptom, chest pain and shortness of breath lasted for 2 nights (Sunday and Monday evening), by Tuesday he felt better. We assumed this was an asthma episode, but recent reports of Myocarditis leads us to believe the had a mild myocarditis episode, given the chest pain while lying down.  He also had typical COVID vaccine symptoms such as low grade fever (100F), pain in the vaccination site, congestion, and itchy throat.

Complained of pain when taking a deep breath and would flinch in pain. By the time got to ER in the afternoon, pain had subsided. Not sure if vaccine related but never had chest pains before &amp; considering report of myocarditis after 2nd shot for younger males. Wanted this documented in case there is a pattern.

                                                The next morning he woke up with arm  hurting him (he couldn&#39;t lift it). He felt a little warm - had a low grade fever -99.something. He had a headache all day. He was very sluggish, tired. He did online school that day. He took a nap and laid down on the couch in between classes. He was really tired. I was giving him Tylenol every four hours. The first time he felt a little better, The second time, it didn&#39;t work. I called the doctor for advice and he told me to give him Children&#39;s Motrin. That seemed to do better. I gave that to him once that day.  The next morning, he felt better. I gave him a Motrin anyway  because he had a light headache. He did say he felt some heart racing. And he was a little tired. He called me from school around 11:30 am and he said that his heart has been racing through the whole morning - he was gym and said  he couldn&#39;t run or anything but his heart was racing. I told him to go to t he school nurse - he had a pulse of 120. I met him there and I called the pediatrician and he saw him at 03:00. His pulse was high but not as high as before. He had rested in between. My son did see a cardiologist in June 2020- they put him on a heart monitor and she couldn&#39;t find anything at that time. At the regular doctor on the 19th, the doctor checked breathing and heart but did not have the materials at that location to do an EKG but said with the lowered heart rate just to watch and if it goes up again to go to Cardiologist we saw in June 2020. He rested some more and it went away on it&#39;s own. After that he was fine and no other issues. In fact, the next day he felt better and was running around and had energy and felt great.

From EHR note: Patient is an otherwise healthy 12yM with recent Lyme disease (erythema migrans) transferred to hospital for hyponatremia, encephalitis, myocarditis. Initially intubated due to aspiration risk, now s/p extubation and stable on RA. Broad workup so far including consultations from neurology, cardiology, immunology, and infectious disease with unclear etiology, s/p MRI and LP with c/f covid-vaccine related myocarditis/encephalitis vs lyme carditis/meningoencephalitis vs less likely MISC vs other. Infectious testing so far negative, patient otherwise has returned to baseline behavior without any current symptoms. He is transferred to general for further workup and evaluation and close monitoring. Diagnosed with Lyme 19 days prior to admission,  treated with amoxicillin; p/w headache, fever and vomiting so concern for encephalitis as above vs inflammatory process post-COVID or vaccine. Less likely meningitis given reassuring initial CSF studies. Negative COVID antibody.  Resolving hyponatremia, thought to be likely SIADH. Given presentation and maternal history of albinism with immunodeficiency, broad workup sent. Also with c/f possible inflammatory response/MISC-C vs vaccine myocarditis.

A 12-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: unknown and Expire Date: unknown) on 22May2021 via unspecified route of administration as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. As medical history it was reported that, he had allergies and allergic to a lot of things, mold, feather dust and everything and dyspepsia. He had been taking Claritin for allergies (but not when he got the vaccine). She stated her son did not have any allergies to medications. Concomitant mediations were not reported. On 26May2021, 4 days after that he was complaining of chest pain. Caller wants to know if her son should get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Caller stated, &#34;He had other symptoms. On Tuesday the chest pain went away then complained again on Thursday. His doctor gave him an EKG and his heart rate was fine. Caller did not take him to the ER at the time because did not want a medical bill. His blood sugar spiked up. He had sweating, vomiting, diarrhea. He said he had &#34;sharp pain in my chest and never felt that before&#34; His blood sugar spiked up. He was dehydrated. He had ketones from it. Caller gave him extra insulin. He had chest pain from the vaccine. It was on Tuesday and happened again on Thursday but had not come back since then. It subsided. EKG was ok.&#34; No one was informed (doctors). I took him to the regular doctor. She did not know. She was not aware of the symptoms. They are not specialized in the medications they are giving. It was hard to give them any kind of referral. Both of us had vomiting, headaches and chills. He had never had chest pains from any vaccines. He had fatigue, these are symptoms form the covid shot. It was 4 days and then 6 days after the vaccine. A fast heartbeat. HCP are not going to help. If they are dosing the covid shots but they are not given the vaccines they did not want to do anything. There was no accountability. Caller having a hard time. No one can give me an answer, no one. Not from the experts, no one was telling me. The vaccine administration should have been through the doctors, they will not take your data without understanding the vaccines. All the kids 12 and up and all male and like my son and probably a lot more but they are not saying it. Caller scared. My son did not have a heart defect. Caller did not know. Heart inflammation; they need to know if it was safe or not. It was scary to know no one knows what was going on or not. Caller asked about myocarditis. The patient had heart burn before but said the chest pain was not that. With the symptoms the caller saw online, she thinks the patient had pericarditis. The patient&#39;s next dose was on 12Jun2021.The caller was reading online that people reported chest pain and ended up in the emergency room and the caller did not want that. All the events occurred on an unspecified date in May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood glucose increased: spiked up on May2021, electrocardiogram: fine on 25May2021 EKG and his heart rate was fine, heart rate increased: fast on 25May2021. The outcome of event chest pain was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of dehydrated. The outcome of blood sugar spiked up, sweating, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, felt sick, extreme fatigue, and slept on and off for about 4 days, dehydration, fast heartbeat and pericarditis was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

We walked around the store, conversed, and 10-12 minutes after injection he had syncope and generalized tonic clonic seizure for minutes. We were transported 911 to Hospital ED where he had normal labs, normal brain MRI, and consultation with Peds Neuro. He was post-ictal for 30&#43; minutes to follow the incident. He has secondary trauma to his R temporal and occipital bones and likely a mild concussion resulting from the fall.

Had him sit, take off his mask, gave him water to sip, took BP (102/60), within 5 minutes he started to come back around, was able to follow command (wiggle fingers) vocalize that he could breathe fine, and felt that there was water behind his ears. His temperature to touch seemed to start to go back down, and once paramedics arrived they evaluated him and released him as &#34;ok&#34; within 10 minutes.

I measured the patient blood pressure and it seems lower than normal. After the patient rest for a while I reassess the patient blood pressure and he seemed to feel a lot better. I asked the family to stay for additional 15 mins or 20 mins to observe him but they insist on leaving . I instructed the parents to observe him and if he gets worst get medical help. I have a staff member at the facility to call the family after 30 mins later and the parents stated he is moving around and feel a lot better.  The parents also called back a few hours later and stated he is doing good.

Patient has no prior history of SVT or any other cardiac related events.  Patient was engaged in a basketball game when the SVT occurred.  Patient has been involved in multiple competitive sports since the age of four without any prior incident related to exercise.  He felt like he could not breathe, his heart was racing, he became dizzy, began to lose his vision and I took him to the local fire station for evaluation.

Nothing concerning but right before he went to bed he didn&#39;t feel good. My son thought he had to vomit but couldn&#39;t. He said his HEARTBEAT WAS SO MUCH FASTER than normal. I got so concerned that I slept next to him which I never did before. He fell asleep after 1 h and woke up the next morning and felt fine. I did not go to the doctor because he was feeling well the next day.

He hydrated with water that day very well and I gave him 500 mg of Tylenol. On Sunday (2 days after vaccine) we were at church celebrating outdoor Mass. about 20 minutes into church my son said he didn?t feel well and needed water. He was standing at the time he said this. He had been standing under and umbrella the entire time to shade him from the sun. About 1 minute later he fainted. He visually looked very pale at the time. We treated him with by having sit down, moved him to air conditioning. It took about an hour before he felt back to baseline.

He had hit his head on the wood floor, back of head (standing to smacking head). We live on an island, had to take ferry to town. Possible concussion. We went to Hospital in town.

Felt tired that night and into the next day with some local swelling and pain to the right arm at site of injection, and also into right armpit. Thursday evening, he was resting sitting on the couch and developed some mild chest pain. Can&#39;t really describe the location or severity very well. Did seem to be worse with inspiration. Hasn&#39;t reoccurred since that time. Still feels somewhat tired today with mildly sore right arm. No fevers. No chest pain today.    IR showed second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine was given to the left arm but confirmed with CVS that it was given to the right arm.

I also had someone page mom because mom went shopping. When I went back out to see the boy, his mom was there and he was drinking some water. I came out to talk to mom. while I was there, the boy started to shake and complained of chill. He look pale, so, I went and called 911. They transfer me to the fire department. They said to have him stay where he is and not have anything to eat or drink just incase her may throw up.I told mom.  After that , I went about doing my things . Then emergency came . Then they all left. About 7 pm that day I called mom for follow up and she said he was doing ok.

I made him sit down and he then said that he felt nauseous. Within 5 minutes of the onset of symptoms, he vomited. He was pale and his forehead was cold/clammy. The pharmacist said it was anxiety and nothing to be concerned about. However, my son said that he did not feel worried, anxious, etc. prior to or immediately following the vaccine.

He did hit his head and appeared to be hypoxic. We called 911 immediately and informed store management. The paramedics asked him to walk off on his own power, but they did offer to escort the family to Hospital which I believe was accepted. His mother and sister were present too.

                                                Patient presents to the ED with myocarditis s/p dose #2 of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.    From note: Patient is 13 yo M who was in his usual state of health prior to getting his Pzifer COVID-19 vaccine #2 on Saturday morning (6/5). Saturday night he began to feel fatigued with fevers as high as 102.8 F. These symptoms continued through the night and into Sunday morning when he had episodes of NBNB emesis. Sunday night he was actually feeling somewhat better and was able to sleep through the night. He stayed home from school on Monday due to fatigue. At 3 am this morning (6/8), he woke up with aching parasternal non-radiating chest pain that he describes as an 8/10 and worse while lying down. Denies SOB and heart palpitations. His parents took him to a hospital where he was found to have an elevated troponin (reported 5.84 - unknown scale) and Hct 28.8. There was also question of an abnormal EKG (?p wave inversion). He got a bedside echo which showed no pericardial effusion. Additional labs included: WBC nml, plt nml, MBCK 16.   In the ED, his vital signs have been stable. EKG was normal sinus. Trop elevated to 0.43 and echo was normal. Reassuringly his echo was normal, he has had no arrhythmias (after nearly 24hrs of continuous monitoring), his chest pain has largely resolved and his troponin has remained stable.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

The Rph administering the vaccine moved in front of the patient and gently moved his head into an upright position. The patient had mild muscle spasms and twitches while passed out but when he regained consciousness he immediately began talking saying he was ok. Father came into the consultation room at that point and Rph explained what had occurred. Patient looked a little pale and eyes were having a hard time staying open so with the help of his dad Rph helped him down to the ground in the corner of the room so he could have back and head support from the wall. Patient was given a glucose tablet and water, and later orange juice. Patient stayed in the consultation room for about 20 minutes before leaving on his own and saying he was feeling much almost back to normal.

I heard a mom scream while I was giving another patient a vaccine. I ran out with an epipen but he was awake, alert, and breathing normally. I asked what happened and she said he fainted for a second and seized or twitched a little. I did not give him any epinephrine because he was not having any issues breathing and was able to tell me he felt fine. We did call 911 per moms request and they came and checked him out.

He fell backward against a closed door and slid down.  He quickly regained consciousness and his vitals were stable.  within 10 minutes he was no longer dizzy or hot.  He was able to sit up right without issues.   Per dad, this is the same reaction he had to the flu vaccine in fall of 2020.

He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

Patient stated that he started to have ringing in the ears and some blurred vision.  Patient&#39;s father instructed patient to lay down on the three chairs in vaccination waiting area.  At this time store employee came out to assist patient and patient&#39;s father.  I (employee) came out to assist moments later when I saw what was happening (I had just finished a consultation with another patient).   We elevated patient&#39;s legs, put and ice pack under his neck, and called 911.  Patient was awake but not very talkative. Patient was very alert and talkative in Clinical Service room at the time of immunization, which was a big change from how he was immediately after fainting. Patient appeared sweaty and pale in color.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was taken at 12:09 pm and was 88/51 pulse 53 (patient was still laying down at this time). Respiration rate was 20 breaths per minute.  At 12:12 pm blood pressure was taken again as patient appeared more responsive and talking more.  His BP was 101/63 and pulse 63.  Immediately after second blood pressure reading, EMS arrived and they took over.  Patient was responsive and drink water and sitting up at this point.  EMS checked patient out and was cleared shortly after.  EMS stated that this will not defer patient from getting his second COVID vaccination.  Before patient left he was continuing to drink water and was eating some crackers.

                                                Patient was administered the vaccine. After administration we stood talking to his mother who had questions. After about 2 minutes they turned to walk away and he lost consciousness and hit his head on a counter. I unfortunately did not witness him falling. He regained consciousness almost immediately and I told him he needed to stay laying down for a few minutes first. After a few minutes he said he felt fine and we moved him to a chair. Within a few minutes, he became ill again so we had him lay down again in the consultation room. He then laid there for about 15 minutes before we moved him to a chair. He stated that before he lost consciousness his heart was racing. His mother states he&#39;s never had any problems with vaccinations in the past. After sitting for the second time he said he felt fine except where he hit his head which was a little sore. We contacted the father later that night and he said that he too had a similar episode with a needle stick a few years prior. The patient felt better later night per his father.

Mother mentioned that he has been complaining of intermittent midsternal chest pain that worsened after eating since the day prior to admission. She had been giving him peptobismol, thinking it was gas related pain. However, due to him persistently complaining of the pain after eating, she brought him to. She denied any fever, shortness of breath, weakness/fatigue. Of note, mother had COVID in march 2020 and she believed he might have been sick around that time as well.  Patient is still in the hospital and continues to receive pain medication and treatment for myocarditis  (NSAIDS and opioids)

                                                Client received his 1st Pfizer vaccination (Lot# EW0187, EXP 08/31/21) in his left arm at 19:15 from RN.  Client?s parents and sister were with him.  Client?s parents only spoke Spanish and an interpreter was present.  After receiving his shot, client sat in a chair next to his sister while RN administered a shot to her.  Five minutes later client stated he felt nauseous.  RN immediately called out to Vaccine Runner RN and Check-in Nurse who were in the hallway to get an EMT.  Check-in Nurse radioed for an EMT to come to station 3 while Vaccine Runner RN rushed to the EMT room to ensure an EMT got the call.  Check-in Nurse stayed with the client and placed a trash can next to him in case he vomited.  RN stated the client looked pale and clammy.  At 19:26 EMT1 arrived at station 3 and collected the client?s medical history.  Interpreter was also translating the EMT?s questions and statements to the client?s parents.  Client stated he had no known allergies, no underlying conditions, and is not currently taking any medications.  Client also stated he was not experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, or having trouble breathing.  EMT2 arrived at station 3 at 19:27 and brought the client a vomit bag.  The client had not vomited, but still felt nauseous.  EMT1 gave the client a bottle of water and juice,  and took client?s vitals at 19:28 (HR:  64, BP:  120/70).  Client stated he felt a lot better.  While walking out of station 5 Lead RN saw individuals grouped together at station 3 with the EMT and arrived at station 3 at 19:28. Lead RN was updated on client?s status.  Lead RN observed that the client was mildly pale and clammy and asked client?s mother if his current coloring was normal for the client.  Interpreter translated to both parents and client?s mother stated that the client did look a little pale.  Client stated he felt better and was just nervous about getting the shot.  At 19:30 Lead RN asked client to try and stand up. Once client was standing, Lead RN asked client if he felt dizzy and client stated no.  Client stated he felt just fine.  Lead RN and EMT?s directed the client to the observation room to sit in a zero-gravity chair for additional monitoring of 30 minutes.  EMTs walked the client and his family to the observation room and sat him in the zero-gravity chair.  Client stated he felt much better and at 19:47 EMT1 took client?s vitals (HR:  66, BP:  100/70, SpO2:  98).  EMT1 stated client?s color was returning.  EMT1 took client?s vitals again at 20:04 (HR:  67, BP:  104/78, SpO2:  99).  Lead RN arrived in observation room at 20:10 with Lead Ancillary to check on client who stood up and stated he felt good.  Lead RN observed that client was no longer pale or clammy.  Lead RN educated parents and client on potential side effects vs adverse effects of the vaccine.  Lead RN further instructed client and parents to see the client?s HCP or visit urgent care if client started to experience additional common side effects for more than 24-48 hours and to call 911 if the client began to experience trouble breathing, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  Lead Ancillary translated all the information to the client in Spanish.  Lead RN observed the client leaving with his family at 20:15. Client left walking with a steady gate.

He was very pale and sweaty.  With his mom&#39;s permission I activated an ammonia inhalant near his nose.  He said he felt better after the 2nd sniff.  After a couple minutes he said his symptoms were greatly diminished and he was ok.  The paramedics arrived and pt was able to walk to the ambulance for further evaluation.  A paramedic came back and said the patient is feeling much better and declined to go to the hospital.  I talked to the mom a couple hours later and she said he is all better.

He was quickly revived by his father, but still felt dizzy and complained of blurred vision.  Patient was given a bottle of water and comforted by his father and brother.  When I checked on him about 20-30 minutes later, he said he felt fine.  He  looked a lot better too.

                                                Patient came in really anxious before receiving his vaccination and was really tense when attempting to receive his vaccine. After getting the patient to relax, the vaccine was able to be administered. However, patient then became pale, lethargic, and had ringing ears. The patient was sat down and given water while being observed. The pharmacist tried to check his heart rate but without success. EMS was then called for more advanced observation. Patient was recuperating while the EMS was on their way. EMS determined patient might have had an anxiety attack and cleared him after finishing their observations.

                                                On the 4th - woke up weak; light headed; and a lot of discomfort - his arm really hurt. General body achiness. After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

Called 911 and they were able to decrease the hyperventilation through slowed box breathing. They stayed for about 30 minutes as the heat rate slowly decreased to just over 100 bmp on 13May2021. Two other incidents of increased heat rate have happened since in May2021. Events were resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. Since the vaccination, patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events included hydroxyzine prescribed to induce calming effect as.

                                                14yo male that was admitted to our hospital&#39;s cardiology service prior to after an episode of acute onset tachycardia (possible atrial tachycardia), dizziness, headache at school.  He had his first covid vaccine 8 days prior to the event at school.  He has a coincidental diagnosis of an anomalous left coronary off the right aortic valve cusps, but his coronary course is unusual where he would be very unlikely to be at risk for sudden cardiac arrest.  He had an ECHO in the ED that showed a mild left ventricular dysfunction (EF 45%).  He underwent a cardiac MRI on 5/28/2021 was done that was normal without myocardial edema or scarring.  His ejection fraction on that study (24 hours later) was 54%.  He was discharged home and had a stress test the following week (6/1/2021) that showed blocked PACs at peak exercise (a very usual finding for an otherwise healthy kid) and possible slow atrial tachycardia at baseline.  His laboratory evaluation including CRP and ESR was normal.  72 hour Holter monitor showed blocked PACs and no supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia.  Mother reports that he is &#34;back to baseline&#34; May 31st.    Of note, his father was covid positive with headache in October 2020.  The patient also had a headache for 1 week without fever.  It was presumed that he had covid as well, but was not tested per PCP recommendation.

                                                Pt was given vaccine and began telling his brother he felt lightheaded. Pt&#39;s brother began to inform his mother. Pt then slumped in chair and began to fall to the floor. Mother tried to brace pt&#39;s fall. Pt still hit the floor and lightly hit his head. LPN&#39;s stated pt had a 5 second episode of convulsions that appeared to be a seizure. Pt did lose LOC for about 15 seconds and came to. Pt did not realize what had happened. Pt was placed on a cot. Pt stated he felt warm and lightheaded. Pt&#39;s VS were taken at 1640 - BP 136/70, HR 61, RR 18, 99% O2. EMS were called and in route. Pt began feeling better. Another set of VS were taken at 1645 - BP 127/76, HR 80, RR 16, 99% O2. Pt had ice packs placed on his neck and forehead. Pt sat up on cot after another 5 minutes and another set of VS were taken at 1650 - BP 123/82, HR 89, RR 16, 99% O2. Pt stated he was feeling better but still had a minor headache. EMS arrived and advised pt to be checked out. Mother agreed to take her son to the hospital herself not via EMS. Refusal form was signed by mother from EMS. Pt, mother, and brother left to go get checked out.

About 7 minutes into waiting, my son said he was thirsty and not feeling that good.  we started to walk to get a water and he totally blacked out and exhibited mild like seizure activity.  After he &#34;came too&#34;, he complained of blurry vision and still didn&#39;t feel good as we waited for ambulance.  Once ambulance came he was feeling a little better.  Vitals all checked out good and were declined going to hospital.  He doesn&#39;t remember anything that happened in Pharmacy, except that he thought he was going to die.

                                                one minute after injection, pt started to fall forward in the chair. father caught him and I was immediately called into the immunization room. pt was laid onto the floor and his legs were elevated onto a chair. father stated pt had never had a reaction to a vaccine before. no health conditions. 911 was called..... but then parent decided he didn&#39;t want them. pt states his vision started to go black before he briefly passed out... probable vasovagal syncope. we waited for 911 to come since they were already alerted. pt sat in chair but then started to get lightheaded again, so he returned to a position where his feet were elevated in the chair. EMS arrived and monitored him. father and EMS made decision to return pt to home.

Per vaccinator,  reports that client was saying, &#34;Wow that was aniclimactic&#34; after getting vaccine. Per vaccinator, she notices within 1-2 minutes client got quiet and then reported &#34;I am not feeling well.&#34;  Client received vaccine in left deltoid. RN requested PHN 1 to get gravity chair.  PHN grabbed gravity chair and asked RN to get BP cuff and pulse ox. PHN arrive to assess client and found client alert and oriented x 4 in chair at 5:53PM. Client was already drinking water given by vaccinator when PHN arrived.  Client reports he was experiencing &#34;dizziness and slight shortness of breath.&#34; PHN ask client if he thought he was steady enough to switch to gravity chair. Client stood up slowly and sat in the gravity chair. RN 1 asked client if his throat felt tight-client responds-&#34;No&#34; and coached client to take deep, slow breaths.  At 5:55PM vitals are: blood pressure: 130/90, pulse: 55 and oxygen: 98%.  At 5:57pm client reports no longer feeling shortness of breath.  Client is speaking in full sentences and able to answer all PHN questions about chest pain and headache and client reports having neither. At 6pm vitals: blood pressure:125/90, pulse:75, and oxygen:100%. PHN instruct RN to get Lead PHN  or Co-Lead. Client reports he has slight dizziness and feels lightheaded and reports that earlier he had blurred vision but now is seeing clearly.  At 6:03PM vitals are: blood pressure:160/100, client appears pale and heart rate:140, and oxygen: 100%.  Lead PHN  arrives to take over assessment and PHN starts calling 9-1-1 at 6:04PM as blood pressure is repeated by co-lead :180/90, oxygen100% and pulse 129 and upon auscultation hears clear lungs and heart palpitations.   Client is then reports shortness of breath and dizziness, no headache and no blurred vision.  Parent reports that client has a history of asthma but rarely needs inhaler so she does not have it on her and that client recently had been on antibiotics for Gastrointestinal history and a bad cough (not COVID)-all symptoms had been resolved before receiving vaccine.  At 6:07pm Vitals: blood pressure: 170/90, pulse:100%; no change in symptoms.  At 6:08pm vitals: blood pressure:170/90, pulse: 94, and oxygen: 100%, client reports experiencing tightness in chest and unable to complete breath. Client reports no chest pain. Vitals taken again by RN due to new symptom, blood pressure: 122/70, pulse:93 and oxygen: 100%.  RN auscultate again and hears palpitations have slowed and lungs clear. At 6:10PM, vitals are blood pressure:124/74 and pulse: 96. Client reports feeling &#34;shaky, tightness on chest&#34; and could not take full breaths.  Paramedics assumed care at 6:12pm.

                                                Myocarditis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 15-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW1077), at the age of 15 years old, intramuscularly on 17May2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was reported as none. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with covid-19 prior to vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The patient experienced myocarditis on 21May2021. The event resulted in hospitalization for 2 days. The patient was currently still in hospital. The patient had been tested for covid-19 since the vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included covid-19 test: negative on 22May2021 by nasal swab. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of myocarditis and included treatment with analgesic. The outcome of event was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the even onset.  More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

We took him to the local hospital and after examination they said the blood work and ekg was fine so they released him. We are at home now and he feels the pain still if he pauses his breath, and he just showed me you can hear a very strange sound coming from his heart as it beats. I can hear it sitting near him a loud pumping or squirting sound in there as his heart pumps! Never heard anything like that before coming from someone?s chest!

Immediately after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the patient reported a &#34;weird sensation&#34; in his chest. The patient became pale, and reported nausea and lightheadedness.  According to the vaccinator it seemed as though the patient went into a syncopal episode. A nurse attempted to do a sternal rub to wake the patient up but was unsuccessful. The patient was then laid onto the ground and woke up; attempted to sit patient up and then went into another syncopal like episode. EMTs were notified and were on their way  to attend to the patient. Patient&#39;s feet were elevated. No history of vaccine reaction. Patient had eaten and had fluids 2 hours prior to the vaccine. Patient was sat up again with assistance but immediately felt lightheaded and had another syncopal like episode. He was again placed in a supine position with feet elevated. Immediately reported improvement of symptoms. Patient had several sips of juice and was placed on  a stretcher and taken to a back room. Patient had mom and sister at his side. As the patient remained in supine position, he denied nausea and lightheadedness; no chest pain, no dizziness. Patient was alert and oriented.

                                                Likely myocarditis s/p 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine.  From hospital note: Pt was in his usual state of health when he received the second dose of Pfizer mRNA Covid vaccine on 6/3.  On 6/6, he developed substernal nonradiating chest pain, as well as low-grade temperature to 99.6.  Pain persisted, so he presented to the emergency department on 6/6.  He did not have respiratory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctival injection, new rashes.  In the emergency department he was afebrile with normal vital signs.  Laboratory evaluation in the ED demonstrated WBC 7.45 (N 64, L 19), Hb 14.5, PLT 191, ESR 10, CRP 0.69, AST 46, ALT 14.  BNP 23.  He was noted to have a troponin leak (troponin T 0.55).  Covid PCR and antibody testing were negative.  An EKG demonstrated early repolarization but was otherwise normal.  An echo demonstrated mildly dilated LV with good systolic function. Pt was admitted to the cardiology service for further evaluation and management of myocarditis.  Following admission he remained afebrile with stable vital signs, but continued to have troponin leak.  He was initiated on methylprednisolone 30 mg IV every 12 hours, and IVIG 2g/kg x1.    Pt is a 15 year old with what appears to be myocarditis after the SARS_CoV2, with significant troponin elevation, coming down, chest pain, improved with IVIG and steroids, and ibuprofen prn. Plan for cMRI to look for late gadolinium enhancement to guide course of therapy.

At 1:00am on 6/8/21 he was struggling to breathe due to pain in the center of his chest upon inhalation. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before. His chest pain was worse lying down and he could not lie down or sleep and wanted to stay standing on his feet. He felt pain in both forearms too. He was crying from the pain and the difficulty of breathing, and was very tired but unable to recline in order to sleep. I called the advice nurse, who checked with the doctor on call at his pediatrician?s office, and she told us to go to the ER due to concern it may be myocarditis or pericarditis.

Five minutes after his injection with the COVID-19 vaccine he felt hot, nauseated, vomited a small amount of yellow emesis twice and became pale.  He continued to sit up in the chair and a cool cloth was placed on the back on his neck and a fan was turned on.   He was alert throughout.  His BP was checked 4 minutes after the event and read 92/60 with a pulse of 74.  He denied feeling lightheaded.  He sat in the lobby with father by side and health department nurses monitoring him for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes pt gets up out of chair without difficulty and ambulates around the lobby with steady gait and denies lightheadedness, nausea/vomiting or shortness of breath.  Leaves accompanied by father.  Encouraged to push fluid, stay out of the heat today and to take it easy the rest of the day.   Checked on pt by phone through the father and he related that pt was feeling much better, denies symptoms.

A 15-years-old male patient received bnt162b2, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 13May2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation at the age of 15 years old. Medical history included Autism and ADHD. Concomitant medication(s) included guanfacine. The patient experienced he has developed myocarditis, inflammation of the muscle in his heart that was caused by covid vaccine, chest was hurting; chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension on an unknown date, shortness of breath, tight chest  on 15May2021. Clinical course details was reported as: She thinks he has developed myocarditis. Experienced shortness of breath, went to the Emergency Department. She wishes for him to receive second dose. &#34;They did a bunch of tests&#34;. Saturday he had to rush in to the hospital because his chest was hurting, he has chest pain on Saturday that&#39;s why he went to the emergency room. The doctor said, he had inflammation of the muscle in his heart that was caused by COVID vaccine, she wants to submit that to Pfizer.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;No, not exactly, he got the COVID vaccine on May 13th. He started developing shortness of breath and tight chest on Saturday night which is May 15th, I woke him up  because all night long he was complaining, I take him to the emergency room at the morning like 4:30 am, 4:30 in the morning of May 16th. The doctor told me that, he said that he didn&#39;t believe that it was a side effect of a vaccine because it was not, it didn&#39;t developed like within 1 or 4 hours to the vaccine like now when I&#39;ve seen on the news that the inflammation that is happening to some kind on the heart, he matches all the symptoms of that. So I need to know what do I need to make and what do we do for the second dose?&#34; Lab test: They did when he was in the hospital, When he was in the hospital 2 days after they did a bunch of lab test.&#34; Treatment: They did give him some medication in the hospital. The notes from the hospital they gave, they says he has tachycardia, hypertension, shortness of breath, chest pain. They gave him Ativan. Caller states she is calling about the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine and states she is thinking her son had the side effect that is being reported of myocarditis and took the 1st dose of the vaccine on 13May2021 and on 15May2021, at night he complained of shortness of breath, and a very heavy chest and moaned all night long; states at 4:00am she and her husband got up and took the patient&#39;s blood pressure and oxygen level and pulse and his blood pressure was elevated at 151/108, oxygen levels were ok at 96-97 and his pulse was 128, and his temperature was 99.7 she thinks. States they took him to the emergency room at that time because they did not know if something was going on with his blood pressure elevated. Caller states she has not reported this information to the patient&#39;s HCP and is calling to ask if she should wait or have to wait on the patient&#39;s 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine. Caller states she did previously file this report but was not given a report reference number and had to call back to ask for her questions. States the patient&#39;s 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine is scheduled for 04Jun2021. States given that they did not expect the patient to have any side effects and they do not want to be in this situation and are planning on traveling the day the patient is scheduled for his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine would they have to wait for his 2nd dose; states she wants to do things the proper way.

Pfizer is aware of the observations of myocarditis that occurred predominantly in a population of young men who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Adverse events are regularly and thoroughly reviewed and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established. There is no evidence at this time to conclude that myocarditis is a risk associated with the use of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. More than 260 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally. Serious adverse events unrelated to, but close in timing to vaccination, are expected to occur at a similar rate in vaccinated individuals as they would in the overall population. [for non-HCPs]: we refer you to your healthcare provider to discuss this topic. Your healthcare provider knows your medical history, can discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and can provide vaccination  recommendations to you. Pfizer is aware of the reports of myocarditis in recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. More than 260 million people globally have now been vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established. Serious adverse events unrelated to but close in timing to vaccination will likely occur at a similar rate in vaccinated individuals as they would in the overall population. With a vast number of people vaccinated to date, the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive.

                                                Pt was a little nervous before receiving the vaccine, but did fine. He was sitting with his brother for the 15 minute wait period when his brother called for help. I told my staff to call 911. Pt had his head back and his legs outstretched in front of him. He was unresponsive at first and pale. Then he sat upright and said he thought he had just hallucinated. He was distraught and did not understand what had just happened to him. I asked the brother if an adult was with them. He called for his mom and she suggested we lay patient down on the floor. She sat with him until EMS arrived. A paramedic took his blood pressure and EKG. He drank some soda and was able to sit up, his color returned, and he was able to stand.
