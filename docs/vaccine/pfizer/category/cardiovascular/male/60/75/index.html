                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

A 61 year old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) at the age of 60 years old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Mar2021 (Lot Number: EL6205) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, mouth started to feel numb and allergies to tree pollen; and family history of diabetic and heart disease (father); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included losartan potassium (TEMISARTAN), gabapentin, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), furosemide, potassium, valproate semisodium (DIVALPROEX) and tizanidine; all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2. The next day, he said his mouth started to feel numb, and he had a loss of taste. Then on Saturday, his eyes started to tear a lot, and the right side of his face started drooping like that of a stroke. He also said he had headache on the back of his head, and his eyes do not. The patient wanted to know if he should go to the emergency room or if this is a normal reaction to the vaccine. The patient did have a sensation starting on Thursday of numbness in his mouth. The patient describes it as a feeling like when he was younger and would use chloraseptic spray, it feels like same numbness. He states that on Saturday his eyes started tearing up, and he does have allergies to tree pollen. The right side of his face feels and looks like he had a stroke, it is droopy on right side. The patient can&#39;t pronounce words right, can&#39;t smile, and can&#39;t close his right eye. The patient was checked with heart rate and EKG with his little machine and his temperature, and they all seem fine. The patient was also getting headaches at the back of his head. The patient took Advil for headaches, but it is not improving. The patient ran out of the Advil and doesn&#39;t have the bottle anymore. The patient took allergy pills, a knock off Benadryl, because he thought his eye tearing was possibly from allergies to tree pollen allergy or possible allergic reaction to the drug. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fine, CAT: not reported, EKG: fine, complete blood work: not reported and heart rate: fine; all on 15Mar2021. The outcome of loss of taste was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Went home and still felt dizzy and then I felt like I need to pee  but I was very cold ,  urinated 3 more times thinking it was because it was due to being cold but doctor explained it was due to me drinking lost of water.  Went to bathroom and bassed out and woke up about an hour later, but during the fall I injured the neck by heating your head on the sink, back and broke my nose, when I woke up  I was still very dizzy. Also felt a fast heart rate,  chest pain, very nauseas and started sweating a lot.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including head CT/MRI and viral serologies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 61-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Blood pressure high, Cancer (Two or less years ago; In remission, Taking medication to follow through with remission period), Allergies and sinus issues, covid virus (in July). The patient reported soreness in the arm (15Jan2021), fatigue (15Jan2021) and  palpitations (16Jan2021) that he felt below the mouth and above the heart, calling it the esophagus area. He wanted to know if others had reported this same palpitation. The reporter further reported that he has a little bit of concern. He felt fine, had sore arm and fatigue that has gone away. Noticed lately, somewhere in his esophagus between his heart and mouth that he is feeling palpitations. Doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s more indigestion. Stated it could be gas. Sometimes comes and goes, feels different than what he&#39;s already experienced. Wanted to double check if this has been heard of or anything similar to it. Clarified product as first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine. Received last Thursday. Received COVID-19 Vaccine in left arm on 14Jan2021 between 15:00 and 16:00. Both arms are sore, but only because other arm is injured. Pain level in injection arm was around 5-6 and he wasn&#39;t able to sleep on that side. Within the second day, 16Jan2021 in late afternoon soreness and fatigue was gone. Indigestion or Palpitations, feeling was happening again. They wanted to know if that is something he is experiencing from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Stated it doesn&#39;t appear to be related. It is around the esophagus. Stated it affects breathing. Stated maybe that has something to do with it. For the dose, they noticed it was a small amount of fluid in the tube that was injected into him. The outcome of the events soreness in the arm/sore arm and fatigue was recovered on 16Jan2021, while for other events was unknown. Information on the batch number/lot number has been requested.

                                                I have been have contact with my primary care doctor because of the reaction with the first dose. He advised me to take Benadryl 15 minutes before receiving the injection.  I stayed at the vaccination site for an hour instead of 15 minutes. I left the vaccination site and went home and went to sleep, I worked over night. I did not sleep well that day. I got up around 6pm and I went to work at 10pm and I was extremely anxious and tired all night. I was a little confused while at work. I got off work and went to my chiropractor who noticed and my wife also noticed that I was extremely pale, after the appointment I went home and went back to bed. When I woke up I was still exhausted that I ended up calling out out of work that night.  I went back to bed and slept all night till 9am this morning. The next morning my color was back and I was looking better. My energy level is slowing  improving but still feel tired even when I got a good nights of sleep. I don&#39;t know if it related, but I went and brought some new shoes and then my hip started hurting. It is to the point where I set up a doctor&#39;s appointment on Monday to have my hip looked at.   See VAERS report 906796 for first dose reaction.

A 61-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL9621), intramuscular on the left arm on 22Jan2021 (reported as 07:45 to 08:00) at a SINGLE DOSE for prevent COVID, at 61 years old. Medical history included triple bypass surgery from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime. Symptoms (unspecified which) reported as recurring and are notably worse at bedtime. Patient is hesitant to receive the second dose. The patient stated he just went to sleep and prayed and then when he woke the next day, at night it did it again. At night it comes and goes, and he still has it happen but not like the first time. He tried to describe that he was washing his hands and he almost passed out like on an unspecified date in Jan2021, he was going to lose his mind. Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown. Outcome of the events dizziness, &#34;feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his brain wanted to pop out of his head/ his brain wanted to swell up&#34;, felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy, and fever was reported as recovering.

History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.

Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 62-year-old male patient started to receive single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 09:00 for COVID-19 immunization; and adalimumab (HUMIRA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unspecified dose (injection every other month) for arthritis. Medical history included arthritis, blood pressure (abnormal), and blood cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol, olmesartan medoxomil, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL XL), and vitamins: ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride. Patient stated, &#34;The reason I am calling, I have just a concern that something happened to me. I did not pay much attention but now I have read the news one doctor died after getting this COVID Vaccine (Further details were not available over the call) I have a small incident happened to me the day after I received my first dose of the COVID Vaccine. I just wanted to get some information. You know what happened the next day night, in the evening I was taking a shower and all of sudden I was bleeding from somewhere. Lot of blood was coming out while I was toweling my body out. I couldn&#39;t find out where the blood is coming from. I checked, it&#39;s not from my urine, not from my rectum but it was quite a lot of blood drawing out of my body. Immediately, I called my wife into bathroom, then I squeezed my body then the bleeding stops. It was on 24Dec2020. You know my kids were at home. I don&#39;t want them to find it. The bleeding stopped and everything went away. Then I thought maybe it is something related to my GI. I went to my GI doctor yesterday to have a checkup, they don&#39;t know anything either but I am due for my second dose for next week Wednesday. Now I had this news about thrombocytopenia on this doctor died (Clarification unknown). So I am just afraid if there is anything related this. Do you have any explanation on how I bleed and where it bleed? It was lot of bleeding even my towel was full of blood.&#34; Patient wanted to see if anybody else had similar experience or if he get the second dose and he get the complication again. Patient was a medical technologist. He was doing ultrasounds. He was working in a pediatric hospital. Patient was not prescribed/recommended vaccination. &#34;Nobody recommended it. During my hospital. I am healthcare professional. So everybody in my hospital. I just went there and get it. I didn&#39;t ask my doctor.&#34; Patient added, &#34;You know everything I read about this case and then you know, I have a cut in my leg which is very unusual. I have never seen that. I don&#39;t know how it happened. You know all of sudden oneday I wake up and I saw a big cut in my feet also. So, I am just afraid (onset date not reported).&#34; The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch number is requested.

A contactable consumer reported for himself, a 62-year-old male patient who received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (reported as by injection) to left arm on 14Jan2021 at 3pm at single dose to prevent COVID/COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety. Concomitant medications included antidepressants. The patient received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine last 14Jan2021 at 3pm, and everything went well. When he left the place, he had a slight headache. He had to stay there for 15-20 minutes to make sure he had no reaction. He just got a little lightheaded, he didn&#39;t think much, and it didn&#39;t get worse. The patient took 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL) and forgot about it. It went away for a while. He took the shot at 3 pm and he took paracetamol at 4 pm. Later that night, about 10 pm, everything kicked in. He was sick again at 10:30 pm, or so, the headache was gone for several hours. He was ok between 4 pm and 10 pm. Then about 10 to 10:30 pm, when he went to go to sleep, his heart started racing, like he was having a panic attack, then he started getting hot flashes, sweating, chills, and aching, and this went all night from like 10 pm to 11 to the next morning. He had a doctor&#39;s appointment to get his knee examined for an upcoming knee surgery. The patient clarified that he didn&#39;t go to the doctor because of the symptoms, he went for his knee. He asked the doctor, before getting examined, and the doctor said he got off easy, as the doctor himself was sick for 3 days. The patient asked the doctor if he could take something to calm down, as his blood pressure was high on 15Jan2021 at 8 am. They had taken his blood pressure to examine his knee, and the doctor said it was alright. He was prescribed with alprazolam (XANAX), and the doctor said it would be fine. The next day, he was tired from the night before. He had no symptoms the next day. After he took alprazolam, he slept fine, he felt better. The hot flashes, heart racing, body aches, and chills were gone, and he read everything as far as symptoms. The heart racing went away about 11 the next morning because he took alprazolam. The patient stated that he forgot to add one more, he had all the symptoms described as side effects, but he also had itching. He had very mild itching and was given cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC, lot number: OHE2723, expiry date: Feb2022, UPC: 4122053077), it was like 80% gone. Every now and again he has a little itch, but it was bothering him all night that first night. Currently, the patient felt pretty good. He has no symptoms other than the slight itch. He further stated that his second dose is on 04Feb2021. Out of all symptoms, the thing that freaked him out the most was the heart racing, he asked if he could take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) before the shot. He has been on antidepressants for a while, he has a lot of anxiety, but the day he went in, he felt good, and didn&#39;t take alprazolam. He also asked if this have triggered all that heart racing stuff. He was seeking for information if there was anything to do to prepare him better, he knew you have to sit there for 15-20 minutes to see if there was a reaction. The outcome of the event headache and lightheadedness was recovered on 14Jan2021, unknown for blood pressure high and tiredness, recovering for itchy, and recovered on 15Jan2021 at 11 am for all other events.

                                                Patient received the vaccine and was observed in the post vaccination area for 30 minutes.  He then went upstairs to his apartment and returned approximately one hour later.  He sat in the lobby and looked somewhat ill.  He was questioned by house staff and said that he was ok.  He then lost consciousness and slumped in his chair.   Medical staff was notified and he was still unresponsive.  He was lowered to the floor and upon assessment, he had no pulse or respirations.  CPR was begun with bag mouth ventilation and subsequently chest compressions.  He received 50mg of IM Benadryl and 40mg of Solu Medrol IM.  He still had no pulse and he an AED pads were applied.  AED analysis indicated a shockable rhythm and one shock was administered with return of pulse.  He remained unconscious and ventilation was continued until EMS arrived.

Patient was across the street receiving his first dose of Covid vaccine.  At that time patient had a syncopal episode.  According to EMS they indicate that nursing there was unable to feel pulse and began CPR.  They did multiple rounds of compressions and patient woke up.  They are bringing patient in today for further evaluation of syncope versus cardiac arrest.  Patient does endorse that he has chest wall pain from where they were doing compressions.

                                                Within 1 minute of vaccine being injected. I started to feel dizzy. I was wheeled in wheelchair to observation area. I kept feeling more dizzy and started to feel tingly in my fingers and legs (both sides equally) After 15 minute observation time was over, I tried to stand up and immediately sat down again as a wave of dizziness  hit me. Doctor in observation area saw me and came over. I told him how I felt. He put his fingers to my wrist and felt my pulse. It was initially between 40 and 90, then steadied off around 90-100. He called for EMTs on duty to come over with a stretcher because he thought I should be laid flat. The EMT took my blood pressure and it was 155/94. The doctor said at one point my pulse was thready. By this point the dizziness was stronger and I felt tingly in my teeth as well as other areas. I was asked about my breathing and I said that it was okay. An ambulance was called for and arrived. I don&#39;t remember the exact time. The moved me from the wheelchair to a stretcher. I could not stand up on my own and lurched toward the stretcher. I am grateful strong people were there to get me on stretcher and strapped in. All throughout this my normally barely noticeable Atrial Fibrillation was quite apparent and more erratic. This was a major reason for ambulance call. Some of the stroke protocol was done including gripping EMT&#39;s fingers equally and following his finger with my eyes. I was very cold throughout. I was brought to the waiting ambulance outside and driven to Medical Center. The EMT took an EKG which showed atrial fibrillation and a line was put into my arm.  When we got to the hospital, I was brought into the triage area and had all my vitals taken. Blood pressure was high, so was pulse then for a half hour, I was very hot and sweated a lot after being cold.

He was admitted to the hospital and kept for observation for 2 days. When his daughter reached out to the patient&#39;s PCP to ask if he should get the 2nd Pfizer dose, she was told he should wait at least 3 months and advised to report his stroke to the public health department.

A 62-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 10Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 62-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine facility type was a pharmacy or drug store. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. Medical history included macular. Concomitant medication included amitriptyline. The patient previously took erythromycin and statins and experienced drug allergies from these. The reported adverse events were superficial blood clot on left calf at the lower end of some varicose veins two days after injection (on 12Mar2021 at 10:00). It may be unrelated, but the patient wanted to let know. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. AE treatment included hot compress, support stockings and ibuprofen (MOTRIN). The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Varicose veins most probably was a preexisting condition, unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine. The reported superficial blood clots are considered a complication of varicose vein and unlikely related to BNT162B2.

A 63-years-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 21Dec2020 14:40, at a single dose for Covid 19. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient has no prior vaccinations -within 4 weeks. The patient is an EEG technician. On 22Dec2020, the patient reported the next day he started to feel sluggish, chills, tired/fatigue, pain all over his body, patient mentioned he has lost weight everyday since he got the shot from 153 pounds to 142 pounds; then on Wednesday evening 23Dec2020, it was a nightmare, he got sweating; fever with a high of 101.4 Fahrenheit; he was running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; and he was so tired and fatigued. Added when he was getting up all that night he was having night sweats up to five times a night and chills; and his heart was pounding. The urination, heart pounding resolved the next day. All of these events have improved at the time of report (now) or gone away but he is still sweating once at night for the last two days and he is tired and fatigued. He stated that he is scheduled for the second dose on 11Jan2021 and he is concerned if he should take the vaccine. He mentioned that he was tested for COVID 19 on 18Dec2020 and the result was inconclusive. He went again 23Dec2020 they called him on 25Dec2020 and informed he was positive per the PCR test. He treated himself with 500mg acetaminophen (UPC 0904672059; lot OBE2896 and expiration Oct2021) and azithromycin Z-Pack (NDC 65862-641-69; Lot ZYSA20012-A; and expiration date Mar2022). The sample of the product is not available to be returned. Predisposing factor was that the patient&#39;s wife was at home and was sick too at the same time. She was tested Sunday with no results yet. The outcome of the events of fever recovered on 28Dec2020, sluggishness recovered on 29Dec2020, pain all over the body was recovered on 02Jan2021; running to the bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine and heart pounding were recovered on 24Dec2020, weight loss was not recovered, and for other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (4 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between event &#34;COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / SARS-CoV-2 test positive) and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded

Increase in metabolism leading to being warm all the time ( no sweating).  Two weeks after second vaccine and while experiencing the above symptoms, I had sudden palpitations with a rapid ventricular response ( 186 beats per minute), severe light headedness, ambulance transport to hospital leading to admission for two days.  This has never happened to me or any family members before.  Discharged from hospital after 2 days in normal rhythm.  Also at this time, taste has returned to normal and foggy feeling has improved.

                                                Recurrence of Atrial fibrillation; Recurrence of Atrial fibrillation; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient himself).  A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 25Jan2021 13:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included hyperlipidemia, GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), and atrial fibrillation, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had prior ablations for Afib. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. On 04Jan2021, 18:00, the patient took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications included dofetilide, diltiazem, loratadine, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), and omeprazole (OMEPRA); the patient received these medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 28Jan2021 02:00, the patient experienced recurrence of atrial fibrillation after 6 months, the last episode was within a month after an ablation. No treatment was received in response tot eh event. Outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported recurrence of atrial fibrillation was more likely due to natural recurrence of underlying atrial fibrillation, and unlikely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                One week to the day after my second shot, overnight I came down with a sore throat which turned into chest congestion, coughing, sinus discharge (green) tightness of my chest. This came on extremely fast. I had to take 2 days off work. I saw my family physician, who sent me for chest X-rays. Came back negative for COVID, but showed signs of Bronchitis. I have been subject to sinus infections, but have not had any issues in over 5 years. I have never had issues with Bronchitis. My Family doctor prescribed Prednisone  &amp; Levaquin. One round did not take of the issue. I received a second round of both. It has not cleared up my coughing/congestion. I still have a sinus discharge (green) infection to date.

Currently remains hospitalized with significant left upper extremity paresis.  Minimal left leg function.  Did require carotid endarterectomy.  The plaque rupture was focal and hemorrhagic with no significant evidence atherosclerotic plaque beyond the focal ruptured plaque.

Due to sudden drop in hemoglobin patient&#39;s heparin drip was suspended since 4/12.  Mixing studies showed partial correction consistent with acquired factor inhibitor.  Factor VIII levels less than 1 consistent with factor VIII inhibitor. Patient was started on FEIBA at 100 units/kg every 12 hours, tolerated very well,  In order to eliminate the inhibitor immunosuppressive therapy was initiated: Will continue Solu-Medrol 80 mg daily and Cytoxan 2 mg/kg daily.  This treatment will continue until his clinical stability is achieved, at which point taper will be initiated.  Patient required 2 transfusion over the course of the hospitalization. Currently, he is stable but still hospitalized and receiving treatments. No signs of new bleeds.

His heart rate was going between 80 and 200. He had 3 different IV&#39;s going in each arm shooting different heart medications in him and the doctor explained that the medications didn&#39;t mix well, could not go in the same IV at the same time. The patient shared that this was the second worst feeling he has ever had since he had his first heart surgery. He meant they thought he was dead or dying he lost feeling of everything. His arm felt better, but every now and again felt like a little knot or something was in there. He was breathing better, they gave him inhalers, albuterol. He thought that his heart doctor was going to start him on oxygen. He went to his Cardiologist on 01Mar2021 on Monday, 2 weeks before getting his first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine: cardiologist told him his triglycerides raised up about 15 was about 268. All his Cardiologist did was change his blood pressure medicine.

All his other blood tests were good, they just said keep doing what you&#39;re doing.The outcome of all the events was resolving.   Follow-up attempts are completed.

                                                stroke; he could not speak; diarrhea; vomiting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 63-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), intramuscular on 12Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a workplace clinic. Medical history was reported as none. There was no known allergies. There was no vaccine administered in four weeks. There were no concomitant medications.  On 13Mar2021, the patient experienced diarrhea and vomiting for 8 hours and 2 days later on 15Mar2021, he could not speak so patient went to the hospital and was told he had a stroke. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test, pcr swab test: negative on 14Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included aspirin, clopidogrel (PLAVIX), atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR), evolocumab (RAPATHA). The events caused hospitalization. The patient recovered from the events on an unknown date.  Information on batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a contributory role of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) to the reported events of diarrhea, vomiting, could not speak and stroke cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed once more information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I have continued to experience slight dizziness from time to time but only severe when lying down, rolling over while lying down, looking straight up, and sometimes bending over.  5 days after shot I decided to check blood presure and it was repeatedly around 175/100. I went to local doctor and he prescribed additional BP meds. BP now good (126/80) but I still experience dizziness from time to time. Yesterday when BP high I also had constant headache and some nausea. Today(3/12), almost week after shot I still experience dizziness to a minor degree off and on, but still somewhat severe when lying down, looking up, and bending over

                                                Symptoms:  Patient states that he has HX of COPD and has noted an increase in SOB on Sunday. He states he is taking his ProAIr inhaler every hour and it helps for the hour, but after that his breathing gets worse. Patient states he gets SOB with lying down and walking. Patient was speaking in full sentences and states it was because he just took his inhaler medication. Patient states he is positive for chills onset Sunday. Patient did have his first dose of COVID vaccine on Thursday. Denies difficulty breathing on Thursday, and per patient could have started Saturday night. DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition:   1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation (HCC)  Patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on p.r.n. albuterol at home as well as nightly Spiriva, coming to the emergency department for evaluation of worsening shortness of breath over the last 3 days with associated tightness with his breathing.  On arrival to the emergency department, patient is sitting forward, tachypneic, prolonged expiratory phase with diffuse expiratory wheezing.  He is saturating low 90s on room air.  He is placed on 2 L nasal cannula for comfort.  He received 2 DuoNeb treatments with EMS as well as Solu-Medrol.  I am going to treated with a continuous nebulizer treatment and obtained laboratory workup as well as chest x-ray.  Vital sign show tachycardia which is likely from his albuterol treatment, he is mildly tachypneic, otherwise stable.   Patient&#39;s laboratory workup is reassuring, troponin is negative.  Chest x-ray does not show any consolidation.  Patient does have some improvement in his symptoms after his continuous nebulizer treatment.  His VBG is repeated after treatment and shows that his pCO2 is going down however he is still slightly acidotic with the pH of 7.28.  Patient reports that he still tight in his chest, improved however uncomfortable going home.  He is still significantly wheezing on my exam, given this I did discuss this case with emergency department observation who agreed to accept for admission.  COVID testing is negative.  Patient is admitted in stable condition. Pulmonary:     Comments: Patient is sitting forward in the stretcher, he is tachypneic, prolonged expiratory phase with expiratory wheezing in all lung fields.

One day after receiving the vaccination I took a walk with some hills and had what I believe was a mild episode of atrial fibrillation. I verified as best I could, using a pulse oximeter.  I feel fine for the most part, but a little bit tired and dizzy. I do not plan to call the doctor unless things get worse.

Because we thought his symptoms were just a result of the vaccine (extreme weakness in his legs, slurring of his words) we did not rush him to the ER as we should have. He is home from the hospital now. We are lining up physical and occupational therapy.

A 64-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), first dose (at the age of 64-years old) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm (reported as injection in left shoulder) on 11Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 1982 and ongoing, ongoing seizure (he had seizures for about 6 years and they got worse,  probably it has been 6 or 7 years he has had seizures), high blood pressure, heartburn and insomnia (comes and goes). Concomitant medication included atorvastatin (manufacturer unknown, Tablet) 40mg strength,  oral administration, 20 mg daily (half a tablet at bedtime) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; cholecalciferol (manufacturer unknown, Tablets) oral administration, 2 tablets in morning taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; escitalopram (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg once daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; lacosamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 200 mg twice daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for approximately a couple of years) and ongoing; lisinopril (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg daily taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; mesalazine (MESALAMINE, Tablet), oral administration, 4 tablets a day  taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; omeprazole (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 20 mg as needed (two or three pills daily as he feels like he needs) taken for heartburn and ulcerative colitis from 2001 (approximately 20 years ago) and ongoing and zonisamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 100 mg twice a day taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for a couple of years) and ongoing.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received the vaccination on 11Mar2021. After he received his first dose of the vaccine he experienced a bunch of symptoms which he listed as sweating, he could not sleep at all the first night, he was falling down, he had no appetite, and had no energy that same day. This occurred after the 15 minute window of waiting after getting the vaccination. On 11Mar2021, after the vaccination, the patient went to the store to buy groceries and started sweating like crazy. He could hardly carry the groceries to the car. He also had wobbliness. On 11Mar2021, the patient fell down and passed out coming home that night and he had blood all over him. He later clarified that he did not pass out, he got into the house and fell down and somehow landed on the recliner. He was covered in blood and all kinds of stuff. On 11Mar2021, he could not sleep at all that first night and his prescription Melatonin (Manufacturer Rugby) 3mg did not help at all. The falling down occurred roughly that same night on 11Mar2021. The patient stated that they told him they thought he was having seizures again but he was not. He had imaging which showed no seizures and Xray of his brain with unknown results in Mar2021. He had to have another Xray to make sure he did not have bleeding on the brain.  Xray of his stomach showed kidney stones on 12Mar2021. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The patient was scheduled to return for the second dose 01Apr2021.  The patient inquired if he should get the second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of events kidney stone, blood all over him, could not sleep at all and wobbliness was unknown. The outcome of events sweating and falling down was recovered on 11Mar2021 and no appetite was recovered in Mar2021. The outcome of no energy was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

So not sure whether having had Covid caused the clotting. Having the vaccine or being out of work with torn meniscus. They think clots started in my legs and ended up in my lungs. I was brought back after coding for 6 minutes. They seem to think Covid caused it. Not sure if vaccine contributed or not. But it did happen 4 days after the shot.

A 64-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Mar2021 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included history of COPD treated by CPAP, high blood pressure, Cancerous tumors removed from bladder- He is cancer free, atrial fibrillation (From: 28Feb2021 To: Ongoing), In Feb2021, prior to receiving his first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine he had some heart problems. He had gone into atrial fibrillation. His doctor prescribed Eliquis and put him on a heart monitor. He took a nuclear stress test and that was ok and now he&#39;s wearing a heart monitor. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; metoprolol (METOPROLOL) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for atrial fibrillation from Feb2021 and ongoing. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. No additional Administered Vaccines on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 17Mar2021, he experienced a little bit of soreness, no complaints, no issues. He was scheduled for the 2nd shot on 09Apr2021 or somewhere. However, on 04Apr2021, he started having a runny nose, coughing up phlegm. He has a history of COPD treated by CPAP. He lost his sense of smell and taste. On 7 or 8Apr2021, he took a covid test. He did not get 2nd shot. Covid test results were negative: IgM and IgG (antibodies not detected) and stated that it does not preclude acute sars-cov 2 infection. The D-dimer part of the blood work came back as 0.44 (reference says it should be less than 0.5). A t the end of Feb 2021, he had A-Fib treated by Eliquis. The doctor said it should be 0 if on Eliquis, but attributes that result to him taking the Pfizer vaccine and explaine dit as a higher blood clot risk. His 2nd shot is scheduled for tomorrow. He was told by the doctor to wait until mid May and start all over again with the [Redacted]. Caller would like to know whether increased blood risk has been reported as related to the covid vaccine. Referenced EUA Fact sheet for HCPs under section 6 OVERALL SAFETY SUMMARY, Unsolicited Adverse Events: There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient wanted to know it is normal to test negative for antibodies after his initial dose. Caller requesting assistance interpreting his blood work results. Provided basic information and referred caller to his HCP for interpretation of his results. The patient had his first Covid 19 vaccine on 17Mar2021. He had no issues with the first vaccine. About 2 weeks after he received his first Covid 19 vaccine maybe around 01Apr2021 he started sneezing, having some phlegm, and coughing stuff up. He does use a CPAP machine at night. Around 09Apr2021 he lost his taste and he lost his smell. He was scheduled for his second Covid 19 vaccine on 10Apr2021 but thought his symptoms were worse than he originally thought. He went to his doctor on 09Apr2021. His doctor did the nasal swab for the Covid 19 virus. He never had a fever or chills. His doctor gave him some erythromycin. He also did some blood tests. His Covid 19 virus test came back negative. On the results of his blood tests on the first page, the first thing it says are that his Covid 19 results are negative. His doctor told him that his body showed no response to the Covid 19 vaccine. He doesn&#39;t see that this blood test is testing for antibodies. Later in his blood test paperwork he sees that it says &#34;antibodies not detected, does not preclude acute Sars-Cov-2 infection&#34;. His paperwork says IgG and IgM were negative. He provides the following in a historical context. In Feb2021, prior to receiving his first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine he had some heart problems. He had gone into atrial fibrillation. His doctor prescribed Eliquis and put him on a heart monitor. He took a nuclear stress test and that was ok and now he&#39;s wearing a heart monitor. He&#39;s reading from his blood test results. His D-dimer result was 0.44. In the reference range it says anything less than 0.50 is a normal range. But he is taking Eliquis and his doctor told him his D-dimer should be zero. His doctor told him his D dimer was elevated. His doctor believes the first Covid 19 vaccine has something to do with his D-dimer result. The caller reports that he has heard about the [Redacted] and [Redacted] vaccine and blood clots but he hasn&#39;t heard anything about Pfizer having problems with blood clots or anything of that nature. His doctor told him that his body showed no response to the Covid 19 vaccine.  Later in his blood test paperwork he sees that it says &#34;antibodies not detected, does not preclude acute Sars-Cov-2 infection&#34;. His paperwork says IgG and IgM were negative. AE(s) did not require a visit to Emergency Room/Physician Office. The primary infection site was Unknown. There were no predisposing factors. A culture was not performed. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                MI, symptoms started 2 hours after immunization; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 64-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), intramuscularly, administered in the right arm on 14Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0161) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination facility type was reported. Relevant medical history included obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP; hypogonadism on bioTE; depression; history of (h/o) pneumonia; colon polyps; recurrent sinusitis; erectile dysfunction; MTHFR Mutation C677T Heterozygous; low high density lipoprotein (HDL); dyslipidemia; lumbar disc disease; and sciatica; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN XL); anastrozole; celecoxib (CELEBREX); levothyroxine, liothyronine (NP THYROID); and escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIM), from which the patient had known allergies. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient experienced myocardial infarction (MI), symptoms started 2 hours after immunization on 14Apr2021. The adverse event (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and an emergency room/department or urgent care, and hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized for the event &#34;MI, symptoms started 2 hours after immunization&#34; for 3 days. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event, which included cardiac stent. The patient was recovering from the event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject vaccine contributed to the event of myocardial infarction.  The reported event likely represent intercurrent medical condition in this patient with history of dyslipidemia.   There is limited information provided in this report. Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG at baseline, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                36 hours following injection of my second Pfizer COVID vaccine on 3/21/21, I suffered an afib episode lasting 15 hours starting in the early morning hours of 3/23/21.  I then experienced another episode of afib lasting 19.5 hours on 4/10/21.  On 4/16/21, I suffered my third afib episode following my second injection, which lasted three hours.  As I was converting to a normal sinus rhythm on that day, I went into sudden cardiac arrest for 10-20 minutes and was transported to the local hospital emergency room via ambulance where I was held for approximately 24 hours for observation and testing.  Since that sudden cardiac arrest event, I have experienced two more afib episodes to date, one on 4/26/21 lasting 8 hours and one on May 5, 2021 lasting 6.5 hours.  While I have experienced afib in the past due to a virus attacking my heart in 2018, I had not had any afib episodes for 14 months and had built my ejection fraction back up to 60-65% over a three-year period.  I have never experienced afib episodes with such frequency since my initial conversion to sinus rhythm three years ago following the virus attacking my heart until I received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine along with never, ever experiencing sudden cardiac arrest following the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine.

My resting heart rate is normally in the high 40&#39;s bpm to about 55 bpm.  My heart rate  remained elevated (between about 75 bpm to the  low 90&#39;s bpm) until about 2 am the following morning when it returned to normal where it has since remained.  I have had no other symptoms.  (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine EAU) I should add that from about 6:30pm to 7:30 pm I had two glasses of white wine.  I know that alcohol can be a cause of an afib  occurrence.

A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: eh9899), intramuscular on 21Dec2020 at 15:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated at hospital. Patient age at time of vaccination was 65 years. No other vaccine was given within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not receiving concomitant medications. Medical history included ongoing paroxysmal afib (atrial fibrillation). The patient has known allergies to squid. The patient reported having a long history of paroxysmal afib, very fit, play tennis at the national level. Prior to vaccine have had 2-3 brief bouts of afib/year. Since getting first shot and again after the second shot, have had frequent afib/apc&#39;s (atrial premature contractions) at least 6 episodes. Adverse event start date was reported as 21Dec2020 at 02:00 AM (pending clarification). No treatment was given for the event. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, she has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event is considered possibly related to the suspect product based on the reportedly positive temporal association in a subject with a positive medical history of atrial arrhythmias.

                                                Patient received his first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 3/3/21. Patient was conscious with no apparent issues after administration. Patient was asked to sit down for 15-minute observation afterwards. A few minutes later patient was swaying back and forth in his chair and saying he was feeling faint. I repeatedly addressed patient by his first name and asked if he could hear me and repeatedly asked if he was okay. Patient began slumping down in his chair but was still conscious. Patient was not responsive but made eye contact with me. Patient requested water. After giving patient water and observing him drink he began looking nauseous and threw up. Patient then passed out in his chair. I supported the patient upright in his chair and made sure he did not fall down or injure his head. I then immediately tapped him on both shoulders and repeatedly called his name. Patient then became responsive and 911 was called. While waiting patient said he was starting to feel better and was able to support himself in his chair. I did not observe any injuries due to fainting. When the ambulance came patient agreed to be taken to the hospital.

                                                Slight soreness in left arm around and just below the point of injection.  This went away around 6PM on Tuesday, the day after the injection.  For about 2 hours around 10PM until I went to sleep on Monday night (the night of the injection), I had a slight fever but it was only slight.  I had a more intense fever (though for only 30 minutes) the evening that I had my flu shot last October when I visited my doctor for a check up, so I would definitely categorize the fever from the COVID-19 shot as very slight.  It was gone when I woke up in the morning.  After I woke up, I was a bit nauseous, but it was so slight (and I have not been nauseous for well over a year) that it took me awhile to actually recognize it as being nauseous.  This lasted for 15-20 minutes and then it disappeared.  On Wednesday morning, my heart went into an irregular heartbeat that felt different than what I feel when it goes into an irregular heartbeat.  I have no idea if there is any relation between receiving the vaccine and getting an irregular heartbeat but I thought I should report it.  I have recovered from all symptoms from the vaccination except the irregular heartbeat.  I put down as &#34;unknown&#34; if I have recovered  from the adverse events as I don&#39;t know if going into an irregular heartbeat was in any way related to the vaccination.

                                                About an 1 1/2 hours after getting my first shot I had what I can only describe as a RUSH/High energy feeling along with a soreness in my chest around my heart area. Lasted for about  2 hours and that was it no other symptoms that I noticed.  Then after getting my second shot had the same thing only much more intense to the degree I was worried I may be having the start of a Heart Issue. This last for a couple days. And now I?m about 14 days after my second shot and my heart area feels much better but my whole back from my neck almost to my waist feels like sore and achy. Never had fever chills shortness of breath or anything really other than what I?m describing above. I?m starting to feel a little better each day. I just boy wanted to report this because I could not find anyone else who had felt like this after the shot. Thank you

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered at the left arm on 17Feb2021 16:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus (diabetic). Concomitant medications were none. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was vaccinated at a pharmacy or drugstore. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 17Feb2021, the patient&#39;s sugar level had shot up very high. It was not going below 250 and went to 390 after eating. No therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the event. Clinical outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient has substantial bilateral lung PE 12 days post vaccination; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional. A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021 (at the age of 65 years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included allergies: penicillin and testim. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 on an unspecified date for covid-19 immunization. The patient had substantial bilateral lung PE (pulmonary embolism) 12 days post vaccination on 14Mar2021 (as reported, pending clarification). The event resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization in Mar2021. Treatment of heparin infusion with rivaroxaban (XARELTO) initiation planned was received for the event. The patient had no covid prior vaccination and had not tested post vaccination. Outcome of event was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

He reports no issues with the vaccine as he was waiting. He denied rash, hives, welts, difficulty swallowing, wheezing, throat tightness, hoarseness, stridor, itching, lightheadedness, dizziness, facial swelling, lip swelling and tongue swelling. The patient complaints of shortness of breath. There was no treatment therapy provided. Follow up response to treatment was excellent (also reported as no treatment provided). The patient was discharged as stable to go home and follow up with PCP (primary care physician). He completed his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (29Mar2021). He presented to respiratory clinic earlier today (30Mar2021) and was noted to be hypoxic and was sent to ED. He reported DOE (dyspnea on exertion) for the past 3-4 days and has felt fatigued for the past week. He notes that his taste seems different over the past couple of days.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray showed opacity in the mid and lower L lung and white blood cell count was high normal on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further Information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of hypoxic cannot be excluded.

                                                Stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 65-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Mar2021 09:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure, bleeding ulcer and helicobacter pylori infection both from 15Feb2021, and ongoing tumor on his heart. Concomitant medication included lisinopril taken for high blood pressure. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 in the left arm on 26Feb2021 (lot number: EN6203) for COVID-19 immunisation. Right before he had his first shot, he was in the hospital on 15Feb2021 with a bleeding ulcer and a helicobacter pylori infection. He had been in the hospital and isn&#39;t sure what all they gave him then. The patient started lisinopril 4 or 5 years ago when he was diagnosed with high blood pressure. His blood pressure was under control with the lisinopril but the patient is no longer on it. The patient&#39;s father had a stroke when he was 42 but he had high blood pressure and didn&#39;t get it treated. The patient got up around 07:00 in the morning on 27Mar2021. The patient&#39;s wife got up at 08:30 when she realized something was wrong. The patient said when he got up around 07:00, he experienced his right side being numb. The patient went to the emergency room and was treated there. He had a stroke. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 to 30Mar2021. The patient&#39;s wife doesn&#39;t know if it has anything to do with the shot. After his stroke, they put him on &#34;carvilo&#34;. When the patient was in the hospital for the stroke, they found other issues. He has a tumor in his heart that&#39;s a pretty good size and the doctor said it had been there for awhile. So, they put her husband on &#34;carvilo&#34; to help with his blood pressure and his heart. She doesn&#39;t think the tumor had anything to do with the shot because the doctor did say the size of the tumor was as big as it was because it had been there a while. They found the tumor while trying to find out why he had the stroke. They still haven&#39;t found a reason as to why he had the stroke. The tumor is on the right side of his heart and they said they didn&#39;t think that had anything to do with the stroke. The tumor was found on 28Mar2021. They did an MRI and a CT scan on his head when he was in the emergency room (ER) on 27Mar2021. They also did an ultrasound on his heart, chest, and abdomen. Since he&#39;s been out, they did an MRI on his heart. They also did X-rays on his lungs. He is getting ready to go back to the hospital for open heart surgery on 07May2021. Outcome of the event was unknown.

A 66-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL1284) at arm, left upper, via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 06:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) formally diagnosed around Jan2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported he got the COVID-19 Vaccine at 06:15 on 29Dec2020 and had to sit for 15 minutes afterwards before he could leave. He said everything was fine, and he walked out to the hospital lobby, and was speaking with a work associate for 10 minutes before he headed to his car. When he got ready to leave, he got in his car, and started his car. He started driving home, and realized he was in AFIB. He did have an AFIB issue.

Watch did not show higher than 84 through the night but I could not sleep much due to the heart pounding. Arose for work at 6:15 and felt tired but the palpitations did not bother while standing. Temperature 98.8. about 90 minutes later, while at work, HR was 130-148, I was breathing deeply, otherwise okay. Chills started about 17 hours post-injection and temperature rose as high as 102.4 in the next 3 hours. HR lowered to about 110 about 16 hours post injection and did not get below 100 for another 12 hours. some coughing throughout this time, not productive. Heavy night sweats around 34 hours post injection. I had mild chills about 48 hours post injection, and fine since then. The palpitations were very uncomfortable but stopped once the HR lowered to about 110

                                                Patient stated they were becoming dizzy and lightheaded. Immediately had patient come into vaccine room to see what else was happening. Patient stated they were also having breathing difficulties. Immediately tested patients bloods pressure. Tested twice and came to 220/120 with heart rate 80. Was an emergent situation. Informed patient I was contacting 911 to have them take him to the hospital as this is an emergency situation. Went and made phone call. Had staff bring patient into waiting area so that we could monitor him if something worsened. 911 advised to just monitor the patient. If he began vomiting or passed out to have him on his side, so he doesn&#39;t choke from vomit. We monitored patient until ambulance arrived. They asked for current medications we knew of (listed in report) and that he had received Pfizer Covid vaccine 0.3ml resulting in emergency BP readings of 220/120 after receiving.  Ambulance took patient to Hospital. Current condition unknown or if anything even occurred after that point. Whole event lasted about 1 hour before patient left with medical personnel.

                                                Immediately after pt received vaccine he told his wife (driver) that he was feeling dizzy. Wife then stopped vehicle in Lane #6 halfway down to observation and called for help from observation staff. Upon arrival of observation staff pt was found to be unresponsive but still had a pulse and was breathing on his own. Pt was in the passenger set. Observation staff alerted onsite medical professionals and MD and the crash cart was brought to the car. Vitals were taken. Within a minute pt became responsive and opened his eyes and began to communicate with healthcare staff. O2 sat was noted to be low so O2 was applied at 6L/min via facemask. Onsite Batallion Chief stated he had already called EMS and they were en route. MD remained at the vehicle with pt and continued to monitor until EMS arrived and assumed care. EMS  did an EKG and pt found to have sinus brady, with a pulse in the 50&#39;s. EMS decided to transport pt to hospital for further evaluation. Pt transported to ambulance via stretcher in stable condition, alert.

At 8pm, my heart was racing very fast and took blood pressure,  It was very high, 152/105 pulse 74.  I called 24hr nurse on call.  She said call 911. Ambulance was on site within 5 minute and transported me to hospital.  I was in the ER at least 6 hours, moderating my heart.  They said I had an A FIB attack.  They got it down and admitted me to the hospital.  I also experienced pain in my bladder, I could not urinate.  They had to drain it 2 times.  I was released from the hospital at 8pm the next day.  Any questions, don&#39;t hesitate to ask me or my doctor.

                                                BPH become much worse in a short period of time. It went from moderate annoyance, having to go to relief myself 2-3 times a night, to  complete  retention.   Was near point of going to ER, but Ibuprofen seems to work to help something come out -- although limited.  Tried Flomax for first time, (had prescription for if needed), but the Ibuprofen seems to help best. Makes me suspect inflammation from the vaccine. Other than that possibility, only reaction to the vaccine was a sore arm for a couple days.

                                                12/21/2020 I had my first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and the second on 1/13/2021. Two days after my second vaccine on 1/15/2021 at 8:50 PM I had a scintillating scotoma in my right visual field in both eyes consisting of a bright flash of light in the center of my visual field that cleared but then it expanded into a C-shaped series of zig-zag lines that slowly expanded into the periphery of both right visual fields. It ended at 9:20 PM. I had no headaches afterward. While I have had migraines when I was younger, I haven?t had one in several decades and I never had an aura before it.   I went to the ED where I was evaluated for a possible TIA and then admitted into Hospital. While there my platelet count was 400% of what it usually was.  Other than the platelet count and anemia (I donated 2 unit of packed red blood cells on 12/17/2020) the rest of my blood work was unrevealing.   The scintilating scotoma only lasted 30 minutes but the elevated platelets (although slowly coming down) continues to this day.

                                                I was monitored the recommended 15 minutes and was fine. I went to the car, was being driven home, and about 20 minutes after the vaccination I developed an odd sweet/metallic taste in my mouth, followed by increased saliva, some difficulty swallowing, nasal congestion, and some chest discomfort. They symptoms were already getting a little better by the time we got home (about 30 minutes after the shot), but I took a Benadryl and the symptoms resolved within 2 hours. After that I just had the expected arm pain and fatigue until the next morning. Since then I have been fine.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

                                                I was going up and down a ladder while painting the eves. I bent over trying to catch my breath with my hands on my knees.My wife who is a nurse said that&#39;snot normal and we need to go to the hospital. While driving there I felt a tingling in my entire body and thought I was going to pass out. We got to the hospital and they hooked me up to a monitor.  My heart beats were super low and jumping all over the place throwing PVC&#39;s. It showed my rate going down to 28 beats and then back up to 60 and down again.It was all over the board. They decided to keep me overnight for observation and tests. Saturday night they drew blood twice to run tests and took urine samples.

A 67-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 20Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (A-fib), cryotherapy (cryoablation), blood pressure abnormal, and anticoagulant therapy (blood thinner). The patient was vaccinated at a clinic. Concomitant medications included metoprolol succinate, quinapril for blood pressure, dabigatran etexilate mesilate (PRADAXA), hydrochlorothiazide, zinc, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]), and krill oil. The patient previously took flu shot (INFLUENZA) in Nov2020 two months ago, and shingles shot (SHINGRIX) years ago and experienced sore arm. The patient reported having no problem until 18:30 when he felt an &#34;increased heart rate to the point where he could hear it&#34;. He pursued saying he read his &#34;oxygen level at 95&#34; and &#34;pulse at 121&#34; with a pulse oximeter, and took his blood pressure, which was at 161/91 wilt a pulse between 128-130. He mentioned therefore going to bed and laid down, and his &#34;oxygen level was at 85&#34; and &#34;pulse at 136&#34; still using his pulse oximeter. He specified that his wife verified the pulse oximeter and after a delayed that felt like 5 minutes, she took his &#34;oxygen level and pulse&#34; which were at 95 and 72 respectively. He stated that &#34;all lasted 30 minutes&#34;. As per source, &#34;Received first COVID-19 Vaccine. Sat for 15 minutes and didn&#39;t have any problems. Last night around 6:30PM noticed a heart rate increase rapidly to the point where he could almost hear or feel it. Pulse oximeter showed pulse was 121 and an oxygen level of 94. Talked to his wife and sat down. Took blood pressure and it was 161/91. Put on pulse oximeter. Oxygen level was dropping to mid-eighties and pulse was between 135- 136. Laid down for 10-15minutes. Tried again and his oxygen level was back to 95 and pulse was 72. Whole episode lasted about 30 minutes. Was reading paperwork and talked about rapid heart rate. Had Afib, takes medication for it and had a cryoablation about eight years ago. Feels fine today. Has not had any more episodes like that and wanted to report it. Wants to know if he should contact his doctor. Wondering will he expect this again with the second dose. Could it happen again and is there anything he can do as a safety guard? Stated he could almost hear his heart beating and was checking his pulse on his neck. His heart rate returned to 71, which is low for him. Usually his heart rate is high seventies or low eighties.&#34; Clinical outcome of the events was recovered on 20Jan2021.

Take  Allegra to relieve them. No effect. Each day more rashes appear. Discussed with Dr. who recommended I generate a report.  Early am of the 3/5 I had a very fast heart beat that woke me up. It was fast but not pounding. From the moment I work up it lasted around 10 seconds then stopped. Did not repeat. Dr  did not think it was related to the vaccine. A fast heartbeat like this has never happened before.

                                                I don&#39;t know that this has any relation to the vaccine, but felt I should report anyway.  This was just over 24 hours after the second dose. I took my blood pressure at home for my regular tracking purposes.  My BP was 151/113 when I normally run in the neighborhood of 117/68.   My monitor also indicated my heart rate was 96 BPM which is unusually high for me as I normally run in the 50/60&#39;s.  I didn&#39;t feel bad at all and my only indication came when I did the actual reading.   I did some deep breathing and took my BP again later in the evening and it was down to 143/91.  Checking back on my heart rate trends for March 24, I can see my heart rate had risen to a high of 117 BPM between the hours of 7-8pm and finally returned to my normal range between 11pm and midnight.  From then on during my sleep cycle between Midnight and 7am March 25, my heart rate remained in the 50&#39;s as expected.     There are no other issues to report.  Again, I can&#39;t say conclusively this was due to the vaccine, but I can&#39;t rule it out either.  I thought I should report the information regardless.

                                                Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness; Almost passed out; Very light headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm (shoulder), on 26Jan2021 at 12:00, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, acid reflux, and multivitamin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, esomeprazole for acid reflux, and ascorbic acid/ biotin/ boron/ calcium/ calcium pantothenate/ chloride/ chromium/ colecalciferol/ copper/ cyanocobalamin/ folic acid/ iodine/ lycopene/ magnesium/ manganese/ molybdenum/ nickel/ nicotinamide/ phosphorus/ phytomenadione/ potassium/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol acetate/ riboflavin/ selenium/ silicon dioxide/ sodium metavanadate/ thiamine mononitrate/ tocopheryl acetate/ xantofyl/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER ADULTS 50&#43;) as multivitamin, all were ongoing; omeprazole for acid reflux; and an unspecified multivitamin.  The patient really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. The patient has been administered both first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. The patient had been having some strange things that he didn&#39;t know if its COVID-19 shot related but they&#39;re symptoms he never had before. About 8 to 11 days after first dose of the vaccine (Feb2021; maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021), the patient had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out or almost fainted. The patient clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8 to 11 days. Also, in Feb2021, the patient had almost a very light headache where he almost fainted. The patient went to the emergency room in Feb2021 and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00 to 18:00 the following day. The patient spent the night in hospital, they sent him the next day. While in hospital (Feb2021), the patient had electrocardiograms (EKGs) of his head (as reported), magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of his head, computed tomography (CTs; CT scan with contrast) of his head, and echocardiograms of his heart (microcardiogram). All of those tests came back normal (okay), nothing abnormal on results. They were relating this to a stroke-like symptom; however, the results were normal, also his blood test results were fine. The patient had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3 to 4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. The patient was not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because the event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit. Because of the first episode, the patient then went to his family doctor and the doctor ordered some other testing done. The patient was scheduled to get a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test (stress test of heart), his results on 10Mar2021 came back normal (not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine). The patient believed that the results of those tests both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. The patient was continuing to have some lightheaded episodes or symptoms just about daily but nothing really; continued to have symptoms which was not normal for him. Sometimes, they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes, the patient had a good day, but he had those lightheaded episodes and he never had it before he got the shot. As therapeutic measures in the hospital, the emergency room gave the patient something for dizziness when he was there, but he was no longer taking it. Currently, the patient was really taking nothing. The patient had also gone to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor where he had a balance test or a videonystagmography (VNG) test done on 17Mar2021. The patient will get results of balance test on Wednesday (24Mar2021). Every year (unspecified), the patient goes and get his yearly test in which they had his blood work done and this and his glucose levels were always good, cholesterol level was always good. All the patient&#39;s other tests come back as normal on an unspecified date. The patient had never had these symptoms before, he hasn&#39;t changed his medications or habits and it&#39;s odd that this happened 9 to 10 days after both doses of the vaccine. The patient would like to know if this has been reported before as a side effect related to the vaccine. The patient was not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. Also, he does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can&#39;t figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines. So the patient doesn&#39;t know if anybody else is reporting this but he had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them around days after each shot and he was continuing to have lightheaded episodes but not severe as those 2 but he had lightheaded (dizzy) episodes daily, since the COVID-19 vaccine. But they didn&#39;t know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the COVID-19 shot. And he never had anything like that, and he was not blaming it on the COVID-10 shot. That was the only thing changed in his lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that&#39;s the only thing changed, his medication has not changed, and diet doesn&#39;t change. Nothing has changed other than the patient got COVID-19 shots. The patient wanted to report it, so the company had a report file and other people reporting it. The patient wanted to know if the company was having any other report or something like this so that he would know if it might be related to the shot. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6203; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly (in the muscle) in right shoulder on 14Mar2021 at age of 67-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen for an unspecified indication, but the reason for taken this drug was &#34;get up and get moving&#34;, the patient took it for many years. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine.  He would like to speak with someone about the effects he had and any suggestions Pfizer may have to help him. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. He received the first dose on 14Mar2021 and on 19Mar2021, he started experiencing side effects. He said all 4 people in his household all got the vaccine and all had side effects. The moment the patient was helping his wife he felt like a sharp needle type pain going through the heart side of his chest. They were little ones, but it was uncomfortable. It caused him to panic. He hanged on to it and it went away in a bit. But 2 hours after that, he had chills and crawled in blankets and stayed until the rest of the night. He has not gotten up since 19Mar2021.  He has bone aches and leg and lower back pain aches. He has a headache on 19Mar2021 and started checking temperature on 25Mar2021. The highest was 104 degrees on 25Mar2021 and ever since (Mar2021) then he had 101 degrees or 100 and something. It also reported he began to have fever on 19Mar2021 (pending clarification). He was told to use Tylenol for fever reducer and started taking it. It also reported he has been taking Tylenol for the headache and fever only and it has not been working, it has actually caused him to have a rash on his face and skull causing dandruff and severe itching and bleeding, so he stopped it. He would like to take Ibuprofen and wanted to know if he could.  When he stopped taking Tylenol, his daughter gave him a lotion for face.  Face is clear and only one place is left that is behind his neck on head.  No further details provided for lotion that he put on the rash. He provided information on Tylenol Extra Strength 500 mg each. He took 2 for rash on 2 occasions every 6 hours and then he started only taking 1 because he has not eaten and felt bitterness in stomach and mouth and was uncomfortable (19Mar2021). The Lot is SSA011 and expiration is Oct2024. He has been taking Ibuprofen for many years and only taking one tablet instead of two. He needs to get up and get going and takes it to help him every day. He did not get tested for COVID, but his wife, son and daughter did and they all tested positive after receiving the vaccine. He assumes he has COVID as well since he has the same symptoms and lives in the same household. He would like to know if he can postpone next dose or can he quit.  Will this get better. If he could take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol. The outcome of events &#34;sharp needle type pain that went through heart side of chest&#34; and &#34;chills&#34; was recovering, of &#34;fever/ highest was 104 degrees&#34;, &#34;bone aches&#34;, and &#34;leg and lower back pain&#34; was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

A 67-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot number was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, at the age of 67-year-old, on 25Feb2021, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Traumatic brain injury at the age of 29 which resulted in a CVA (right sided stroke)because the hospital did not know how to give Mannitol, behavioral problems in 2008, run over by a train in 2008, wears two AFOs (one on the left leg from having a right sided stroke, he also wears one on his left leg from having a stroke with right sided weakness, the right AFO was worn since he was 29, and then the other one he started wearing in 2008 when he was run over by a train and almost had his leg severed and he wears a left AFO), dementia diagnosed 4-5 years ago, head surgeries, depression, affective disorder, anxiety. The patient had multiple hospitalizations, and he has hyper reflexivity like all brain patients have. The patient has no history of blood clots or emboli. Concomitant medications included olanzapine (ZYPREXA) taken for depression and oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) taken for affective disorder and anxiety.  The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number not reported) single dose for covid-19 immunisation, pneumonia and flu vaccine in 2008 for immunization and has no reaction. The patient received his second dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021 and two weeks later he was found down/ was found down unconscious at the nursing home and his oxygen was in the 60&#39;s on 15Mar2021. The nursing home did not know if her brother hit his head because it was unwitnessed. The patient was found down, not responsive, and it was an unwitnessed fall. The patient was treated as a trauma patient and that this occurred around 10 oclock on 15Mar2021. At that time, he was transferred to a local hospital to the emergency room and put on oxygen. They transferred him within 4 hours because they did not know what to do. Caller adds that the hospital thought that he had a subdural hematoma but the hospital does not have a neuro radiologist, so the hospital transferred to the other hospital that somebody with head knowledge can look at his CAT scan. The patient was misdiagnosed with a subdural hematoma because there were changes in his CT scan from his 3 previous brain surgeries. The patient had a traumatic brain injury when he was 29, and experienced changes.  The patient was found to have submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli on 15Mar2021 described as central lobar sub segmental PEs in both lungs, PE was within the distal right main artery, pulmonary artery distal left main, left middle lobe, middle right lobe / upper right lower lobe and middle lobar, segmental and sub segmental pulmonary arteries. The patient also had pulmonary emboli in the distal left main pulmonary artery of left middle lobe and left lower lobe, pulmonary arteries. There was also some degree of right heart dysfunction which was diagnosed by contrast. On 15Mar2021, the patient also had right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein. The patient is in a nursing home, the doctor did not want to listen to the reporter because her brother is a nursing home patient and they just assume he is immobile but he is not.  The patient underwent lab test and procedures which included Blood sugar very high (they think it was because of heart strain and acute injury because then it came down down down), A1C elevated, Haptoglobin elevated, elevated troponin. These results were all elevated and from acute injury. At the time of the report, the patient is feeling better and needs less oxygen. The events found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism, right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein, and some degree of right heart dysfunction caused hospitalization from 15Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The reporter absolutely does believe the events and the suspect drug are correlated. Outcome of found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism was recovered on 18Mar2021 while it was unknown for the other events.

A 67-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination: 67 years). Medical history included diabetes. Concomitant medication(s) included atorvastatin (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN]); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]); lisinopril; insulin taken for diabetes mellitus. The patient experienced thrombocytopenia, he had clot in the legs and in the lungs and have a low platelet count on an unspecified date. The patient was hospitalized for the events on an unspecified date. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CBC: unknown result on 08Apr2021, Heparin associate antibody: unknown result, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP): unknown result and platelet count: low on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of thrombosis included Heparin drip and Argatroban. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events are considered unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine, being rather intercurrent occurrences. Clots in the legs and in the lungs were likely favored by the mentioned diabetes and by a possible hyperlipidemia (the patient was taking  atorvastatin) in a setting of possible arterial hypertension (the patient was taking lisinopril).  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 67-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EK9231; Expiration Date was not reported), via intramuscular route of administration in Arm Right on 23Jan2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostatomegaly, drug hypersensitivity both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included finasteride (FINAS-TERIDE); ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 23Jan2021 12:30, he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient states he felt fine at the clinic after 15 mins and then after he left he felt lightheaded and dizzy and this continued on. Patient says his reaction was about 20 plus minutes after his injection, which he was fine when he got the injection, he became lightheaded and that has kind of continued on. He says it was pretty bad on the first day, then the second day it went away. He says a couple days later it came back, with his heart kind of racing, and he was still experiencing that though it was getting better. This was not something he had be-fore and he feels anxious and body is tight with dizziness. He says he experiences it periodically, and today it was not bad, but yesterday it came back again. He says he was concerned about that, but he hasn&#39;t passed out or anything. He says he went to the doctor and had an EKG and blood work done, which were all ok. He says it has been off and on, and he was kind of very anxious and tense as well, his insides are tight and jittery, sort of. He says he didn&#39;t see that listed as a common side effect. He says he had soreness at injection site, that went away, and he had no fever or any-thing, just the lightheadedness. He says he wants to see about the lightheadedness, if it had been reported by others, since he didn&#39;t notice it as a common reaction, to see what is going on there, since it has been over a week and it hasn&#39;t totally gone away, so he is concerned about having his second dose. Am doing better now. Went to the doctor for tests on 27Jan2021 (Wednesday). Test results were okay. Patient states these are not some of the common side effects he has seen or read about. He would like to know when will his symptoms go away. Patient would like to know if he should receive the second dose that was scheduled in less than two weeks. Patient states he called his doctor had an EKG and blood work done and his tests were negative. The outcome for soreness at injection site was recovered on an unspecified date and for rest events was recovering.

About 8-11 days after first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine he had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out. About 8-11 days after second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine he had a very lightheaded episode that was much more vertigo-like where things were spinning. He clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8-11 days.  Consumer is not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. He does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can&#39;t figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines.   Patient: Age at onset: Over the age of 65 years. Reporter: Address: Unknown. Primary: Further address details/Email: Unknown. Very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out: Onset about 8-11 days after first dose was administered, maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021. He went to the emergency room on the date of event onset and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00-18:00 the following day. While in hospital he had EKGs of his head-verified this information with caller repeatedly; MRIs of his head; CTs of his head; and echocardiograms of his heart. All of those tests came back ok, nothing abnormal on results. They recommended he have a stress test done which was not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Very lightheaded episode that was much more vertigo-like where things were spinning: Onset was about 8-11 days after second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. He has never had vertigo in his life before event. He went back to the emergency room on date of onset of this event, but was not admitted to the hospital at that time; was only in the emergency room about 5-6 hours. While in the emergency room he had CT scans of his head, MRIs of his head and EKGs and everything looks good, nothing abnormal on results. Outcome: He still has ongoing very lightheaded episodes for a good part of the day. Those episodes usually last about 30 minutes and occur multiple times daily but are not really severe like the 2 initial events were following the first dose and then the second dose. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: First dose: 26Jan2021 Lot: EL9263 NDC/Expiry: Unknown, this is not on CDC vaccine record card. Dose: Unknown strength/volume/dose injection to left arm shoulder before 12:00 Second dose: 15Feb2021 Lot: EL9267 NDC/Expiry: Unknown, this is not on CDC vaccine record card. Dose: Unknown strength/volume/dose injection to left arm shoulder before 12:00 - verified with reporter that details were same for both first and second doses. This completed his prescribed therapy. Regarding concomitant products and other medical conditions caller reported he really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. Regarding other testing/investigations done relative to these events:  He had a nuclear stress test and exercise stress test, both performed on 10Mar2021 he believes and results of those tests were they both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. He has gone to the ENT-ear, nose and throat doctor where he had a balance test done which he referred to also as a VNG test-Videonystagmography done on 17Mar2021. He will get results of balance test on Wednesday, 24Mar2021.  He had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3-4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. He is not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit.

Yes NDC number: Unknown UPC number: Unknown Lot Number: EL9267 Expiry date: Unknown History Concomitant Products Other Products Yes Omeprazole Indication - Acid reflux Multivitamin Amlodipine Dosage 5 MG Indication Blood pressure   Additional Context: Consumer stated, &#34;I have been having some symptoms but I did call into one of your number yesterday and they told me call back and try to get into you but they did gave me some case number in case help you, they did an open internet case# and I will give you that number if you like it. It&#39;s # (Hence follow-up was checked). Well I have been having some strange things that I don&#39;t know if its Covid shot related but it&#39;s symptom like I never had before. After I had received the first shot, I had almost a very light headache where I almost fainted. We went to ER, they were sort of testing, it might be stroke like symptom and they did a MRI of my brain and they did CT scan of my brain and CT scan contrast. They did micro cardiogram, some EKGs and work. All of those come back normal. So I spent the night in hospital, they sent me the next day. I continued to have some light headed symptoms but nothing real bad but continued to have symptoms which was not normal for me. After I had my shot about 10 days after the second shot, I had another episode. This was much more vertigo like or the room is spinning and the walk and things are moving. I did go back to ER again just in case there was something going on. They tested again another CT scan and EKG and everything looked normal and they said it sounded like a vertigo related. I told him I had shot about 10 days after each shot, the symptoms hit me. Because of the first episode my family doctor ordered some other testing done, and they did stress test of my heart, a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test of my heart and both came back normal. But I am continuing to have the light headed, the episodes just about daily. Sometimes they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes I have a good day but I have those light headed episodes and I never had it before I got the shot. I am also going ENT- ear, nose and throat doctor to check on vertigo stuff and they did some testing last week and I am supposed to get the result tomorrow on what they found about vertigo test but I never had vertigo or light headed or anything before the shot. So I don&#39;t know if anybody else is reporting this but I had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them 10ish days after each shot and I am continuing to have light headed episodes but not severe as those 2 but I had light headed dizzy episodes daily, since the Covid vaccine. I want to report it, so you guys have a report file and other people reporting it. I guess I sort of want to know if you guys were having any other report or something like this. So that I know it might be related to the shot. I am still working with my ENT and I tried to figure out if it&#39;s vertigo. If it&#39;s not vertigo then they have really run all sorts of test and if it&#39;s not vertigo we don&#39;t know if Covid shot triggered the vertigo or not. Let me know, we don&#39;t know. So they have ran 30,000 dollar test on me and so far all my tests are coming back normal.&#34; Consumer was informed about the role of Pfizer Drug Safety and Pfizer Medical Information.

Can you forward this call to that department?&#34; Call could not be transferred because of some technical issue. When probed for exact date of AE, &#34;Consumer stated, hang up one second. Let me pull my card out. I think it&#39;s all I that other file that I gave but I&#39;ll give it you again. I received my first shot on January 27 of this year and I had the first episode February 10th, then I received my second shot on February 25th of this year and I believe it was march 4th, I think when I had those episodes. Those are the 2 episodes. I had smaller episodes daily but they were two bad episodes.&#34; When probed for Physician&#39;s details, Consumer stated, &#34;It was distributed from a count location.&#34; When probed for LOT#, Consumer stated, &#34;Hang up one second. I haven&#39;t told you one thing, my second shot was February 15 not 25. I was looking at my visa card. My first shot was EL9263 and my second shot was EL9267.&#34; Expiration date of vaccine: Consumer stated, &#34;I doesn&#39;t have that.&#34; Dose of vaccine: Consumer stated, &#34;It did not write that on card.&#34; When probed for anatomical site of vaccine administration, Consumer stated, &#34;Left arm shoulder.&#34; Lab Test: Consumer stated, &#34;Every year I go and get my yearly test in which they had my blood work and my glucose levels are always good, cholesterol level as always good. All my other tests come back as normal.&#34; (Further not clarified hence not captured in tab) Treatment: Consumer stated, &#34;The hospital was, the emergency room gave me something for dizziness that I am no longer taking. They gave me something for dizziness when I was there but I am no longer taking it. So I am really taking nothing. This time I am working with ENT i.e. ear, nose and throat doctor, they are doing vertigo type testing but they got nothing, the results are supposed to be back tomorrow. I don&#39;t know what test they are going to show, if they do show vertigo there will be some treatments to help me. But we don&#39;t know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the Covid shot. And I never had anything like that and I am not blaming it on the Covid shot. That was the only thing changed in my lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that&#39;s the only thing changed, my medication has not changed, diet doesn&#39;t changed. Nothing is changed other than I got Covid.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Can you give me report#.&#34; Reportum# was provided as # #Is there a product complaint to report?No Is there a medical information request?Yes Please describe the medical information request Consumer stated, &#34;I have been having some symptoms but I did call into one of your number yesterday and they told me call back and try to get into you but they did gave me some case number in case help you, they did an open internet case# and I will give you that number if you like it. It&#39;s 4NW3L5MR (Hence follow-up was checked). Well I have been having some strange things that I don&#39;t know if its Covid shot related but it&#39;s symptom like I never had before. After I had received the first shot, I had almost a very light headed where I almost fainted. We went to ER, they were sort of testing, it might be stroke like symptom and they did a MRI of my brain and they did CT scan of my brain and CT scan contrast. They did micro cardiogram, some EKGs and work. All of those come back normal. So I spent the night in hospital, they sent me the next day. I continued to have some light headed symptoms but nothing real bad but continued to have symptoms which was not normal for me. After I had my shot about 10 days after the second shot, I had another episode. This was much more vertigo like or the room is spinning and the walk and things are moving. I did go back to ER again just in case there was something going on. They tested again another CT scan and EKG and everything looked normal and they said it sounded like a vertigo related.&#34; Consumer was informed about the role of Pfizer Drug Safety and Pfizer Medical Information.

A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 24Mar2021 (at the age of 67-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. It was reported that the patient had no known diseases or conditions. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications (&#34;other medications in two weeks&#34;) were reported as no. It was reported that the patient was not on any medications prior to the adverse events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EL9266) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 03Mar2021 (at the age of 67-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced sore arm. On 25Mar2021 at 08:45 the patient experienced I went into a-fib and itchy inner arm and on an unspecified date the patient experienced typical reported symptoms that mimic COVID. The clinical course was reported as follows &#34;I had just sore arm after shot 1, but after shot 2 I went into a-fib. I also had the typical reported symptoms that mimic COVID and itchy inner arm.&#34; The adverse events I went into a-fib and itchy inner arm resulted in a physician office visit and the event I went into a-fib required treatment with blood thinner and calcium blocker. The patient was tested for COVID-19 post vaccination on 07Apr2021 with a nasal swab which was negative. The clinical outcomes of the events I went into a-fib and itchy inner arm were not recovered/not resolved and the clinical outcome of typical reported symptoms that mimic COVID were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Atrial fibrillation cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8730), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 10:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included knee surgery, dislocated shoulder (he has dislocated that shoulder in the past several times but had no recent issues), carpal tunnel syndrome and, rheumatoid arthritis, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. In Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm opposite where he received the injection. He reported he like had a muscle tear that it has an intense excruciating pain. He took three aspirin and put a heating pad on it that didn&#39;t touch it. He then reported that the pain went to his knee and it &#34;got all blow up&#34; and stated that that knee had to be drained. He then stated that the calf on his other leg &#34;got messed up&#34; and was found to have a blood clot as well as fluid on that knee. He reported that it was as stiff as a board and that he could not walk on either of his knees for a couple of days. He reported that he still has problems with the one knee that &#34;blew up&#34; and had to be drained but stated that the inflammation in the calf where blood clot was has receded and is back to normal. He stated that he had to visit the emergency room twice and see an orthopedic surgeon for these issues and has been prescribed Xarelto to take to treat the blood clot. In the morning his leg was stiff. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated on 16Apr2021, blood clot on right leg on 12Apr2021, and pain in groin on 13Apr2021. The pain in his groin went down, but his calf swelled to twice the size and it felt like a horse because he was favoring it. It felt like a muscle cramp. The orthopedic saw him for his left knee and he was seen in the Emergency Room for his right and they called his primary doctor. He tried to work and paid the price with his left knee. He has been taking Tylenol and icing it. The last two days (unspecified date) he has been babying it, the weather has been not so great, so he is laying low and give it a rest, but knows he is supposed to get up and move around so he has been doing that and elevating it. He would like to know if, based on these symptoms he experienced after the vaccine, he should get the second dose of the vaccine, which he states he is supposed to get on Tuesday. The outcome of the events &#34;Right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated&#34;, and &#34;Pain in groin&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

After 3 hours I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and they suggested I call 911 and go to the Emergency Department to be sure I was not having a heart attack. Multiple EKGs, a chest xray, and blood tests revealed that my heart was in good shape. I have continued  to have very slight pressure in that area, but it is occasional and is almost gone. Even after 5 days since the vaccination, I am experiencing side effects although they have reduced in severity. Fatigue, occasional slight dizziness, occasional shortness of breath, occasional slight pain in various parts of my body.

                                                acute myocardial infarction; He was found by his secretary unconscious; feeling unwell; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse.  A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), intramuscular in the left arm on 19Jan2021 (at 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   Medical history included blood cholesterol of 200 (not further specified).  The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included irbesartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 19Jan2020 at 08:00, after the vaccine, that patient was at work and was feeling unwell and the patient was found by his secretary unconscious. An ambulance was called. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was 79/38 and electrocardiogram showed acute myocardial infarction. He underwent one stent placement with the remaining arteries normal. He was also started on ticagrelor (BRILINTA), metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and atorvastatin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient immediately improved and was feeling well and resumed exercise. The clinical outcomes of the unconscious, acute myocardial infarction, and feeling unwell were recovering. The events required emergency room visit and were assessed as serious for requiring hospitalization for 2 days and being life-threatening.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that reported events acute myocardial infarction, unconsciousness and feeling unwell are related to BNT162B2.  The events are more likely intercurrent medical condition for this elderly patient. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Over the following six days, symptomes frogresses to extreme skin sensitivity and diffuse aching of chest cage and muscles, back, associated with fatigue and stiffness of joints especially after being at rest and trying to move. By the 6th day after onset of symptoms, an erythematous eruption developed along the left T7 dermatome, becoming more pronounced on the 7th day, but not the true vesicular rash we usually see in zoster dermatitis. Discomfort is relieved by taking excedrin and tylenol. I did not try NSAIDs due to gastritis reaction. No fever or chills, sore throat, cough, etc. I started Valtrex today  to be taken tid.

I immediately assessed the patient for s/sx of anaphylactic or severe reaction. He woke up within ~30 seconds of fainting. He was breathing and speaking fine. He told me he was anxious and also did not have anything to eat or drink all day and believes this is the cause of why he fainted. I had him take a few deep breaths. Injection site looked normal and no issues with breathing. Called EMS to assess him: glucose, blood pressure, &amp; vital signs were all normal. While being assessed he passed out in chair so EMS took him to the hospital. He was discharged from the ER the same day per RN, at the facility. They did not find anything wrong with him and also believe it was due to nerves/lack of eating. No significant medical history per form patient filled out or that he verbally stated.

Patient History and other products were reported as no. The patient experienced chest pressure sensation on 22Jan2021 with outcome of resolving. The details was as follows: the patient got the vaccine today (on 22Jan2021) about 10:57AM. When getting the vaccine they made his go through stalls, it was multiple cars on each side, what stood out to him was, when his vehicle moved up, he was the driver in this case, and so the vaccination was on his left arm, when the gentlemen went to insert the needle, he expected it to be a green needle attached, but the color of the syringe was black with a black band. He noticed the car before had a green attachment for their needle and the syringe, it was Green and clear looking but his was black. He asks if the color of the needle is suppose to be a certain color. Caller was informed that he may need to contact the facility from where he received the vaccine for this clarification. He also adds that he was okay for the 15 minutes, but then he left feeling a little sensation in the chest that he did not have before, it was not superficial on the skin it was internal in his chest. He was naturally calling to see, what he could find out, are there multiple colors for the needles or were they standard, green or clear plastic. He also would like to know if Pfizer directs the administration of the product to be drawn up in front of the client. The chest sensation started about 1:30 or 2 o clock PM the same day, he described the chest sensation as internal, in the center of the chest, sort of like a pressure downward, also accompanied with slight burning sensation, something that was different that he had never usually felt. He also asks if there was a certain protocol or standard the folks administering the vaccine were suppose to follow. The outcome of event was reported as the chest sensation has dissipated a little in terms of intensity, but he felt as if it was trying to be dormant in that area.

                                                Upon my return home, I felt very dizzy, weak, nearly  fainted, where  a sensation ran through the left side of the body. I then was assisted to the bed, where my left arm and left leg felt numb. I rested assuming this would fade away, being I has some numbness from the 1st vaccine.  On 3/24/21, as I attempted to get up from the bed,   I could not maintain my  balance and gait. The numbness was still in my entire left arm and entire left leg, yet I was able to raise move and wiggle my limbs, toes, fingers to a degree.

A 68-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 03Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at the age of 68-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included paraplegic, he has been paralyzed for 45 years. The patient received first dose of the vaccine on 10Feb2021 with lot number: EN5318, expiration 31May2021. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient went on Monday to the ER for an unrelated condition and they did a CT scan and found a blood clot, a pulmonary embolism in his right lower lobe. He confirms the pulmonary embolism was diagnosed on Monday, 15Mar2021.  He got home that night and read the headline in the (Withheld) times that said several European countries are pulling the Astra Zeneca vaccine over concerns about blood clots even though there has not been any causal relationship found. He thought that with the drug companies, they should be able to have data regarding potential adverse effects for Pfizer so he was calling report that. He discusses it with the ER doctor and he couldn&#39;t really figure out why he had a blood clot, it was incidental to what he was being scanned for, it surprised him. They put him on Eliquis so he is on an anticoagulant, which will cost him a fortune. Today will be the third day he has been on the Eliquis. He is at home and he would say his only concern is that he does have hemorrhoids so when he has bowel movement tomorrow, because he doesn&#39;t go every day, but when he goes he is concerned if he starts to bleed that the anti-coagulant might cause the bleeding to be more significant than it usually is. No further information provided. His only other concern is he seems to have some kind of hypothermia, he is not entirely sure because of his thermometer is not very good. That is the reason he went into the Emergency Department because it kept reading 94.7 and he googled it and it said if it is below 95 it is a medical emergency and go to the ER so he got to the Emergency Department and it was 97.6 and now he checked his temperature again with the thermometer and it was 96.8 so either he has a faulty thermometer or something but he is experiencing some kind of chills.  The outcome of the events was unknown.

Received second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine in AM of 3/16, having had severe adverse reactions (fever up to 104, n/v) to the first dose three weeks earlier. Experienced recurrent fevers (up to 103) beginning by the evening of 3/16, for which he took acetaminophen.   Awoke at 3 AM w/ recurrent fevers, for which he took ibuprofen.

Febrile (T 39.6) w/ rigors, tachycardic, tachypneic, and poorly responsive on arrival. Continued to experience episodes of emesis, and was felt to have possibly had a seizure episode (&#34;looked to the side and was shaking&#34;; no clear tonic-clonic movements noted). Was thus intubated for airway protection. Initial laboratory w/u revealed presence of mild leukocytosis (WBC 12.6, 47p49L0Eo), lactic acidosis (LA 5.2), hyperglycemia (glu 297), elevated lipase level (161) renal insufficiency (Cr 1.23). extubated on 3/19.  received antibiotics for positive blood culture (streptococcus parasanguinis).   diagnosis: ADVERSE EFFECT OF CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 VACCINE

A 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm at the age of 69 years, on 18Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known for a history of heart disease, stage 4 kidney failure and polycystic disease. He had been bleeding from the kidneys for a week prior to receiving the vaccine, heart attack and cholesterol. He stated he needs some reassurance and added he has Stage 4 kidney failure with polycystic disease. He already consulted with his heart doctor and kidney doctor and they say get the vaccine. He mentioned that every now and then he gets blood from a cyst rupture. On the day of the first shot he was having a little bit of bleeding in his urine. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for cardiac disorder; atorvastatin (ATORVASTATIN) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) taken for blood pressure abnormal and multivitamins. The first shot knocked him on his butt. He slept for two weeks then he started to pass blood clots in his urine. He read that the vaccine can cause clotting and he doesn&#39;t know if that might have caused the clots right after the shot. He just needs someone to hold his hand about getting the second shot. He has to leave in a couple of hours to get it. He was asking do we see a pattern where people have had a bad first reaction with the first shot and they don&#39;t have a bad a reaction the second time around. He clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 at 1600 in the right arm. He was fine until Saturday (20Feb2021) when he woke up nauseous; really tired; could not get out of bed; and then really didn&#39;t do anything for two weeks. He added he couldn&#39;t stay awake even sitting up in his chair. He couldn&#39;t eat anything because the sight or smell of food made him gag, even in the grocery store. He added he also noticed he started to get the blood clots in his urine the second day after the shot (20Feb2021). On 19Feb2021, he mentioned he had a bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and he usually does not bruise. He stated he felt like he had all the symptoms of COVID. All of these symptoms lasted two weeks. When he finally felt better the only thing he wanted to eat was a burger and fries. He is still bleeding but it is not clotting anymore. The clots only lasted about a week. He also thought he was having a heart attack, but was too tired to go to the hospital. After speaking to his physician/specialist, they encouraged him to go ahead and get the 2nd dose. The patient  would like to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks for him to receive the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine based on his medical history. The patient would like to know whether one dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine provides some protection. The patient was asking whether he might die from receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The outcome of the events heart attack was unknown; events bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and blood clot in urine was recovered on 27Feb2021 while other events were recovered on 06Mar2021.

A 69-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood clots (reported as blood thinner). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 2019 and ongoing as blood thinner. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Feb2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization which gave him severe diarrhea, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, a sore arm and it wore him out. After the second dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 which was administered in a public health department, the patient experienced sore arm. He was concerned because around 02:00 on 19Mar2021, he got up to go to the bathroom and noticed his left leg was basically numb and rubbery.  As soon as he tried to stand up, he fell. He thought the second vaccine was the one everyone says will be harder than the first. They even gave him a sheet of paper that scared the hell out of him. Thought he was okay after the second vaccine until around 02:00. At first, he thought his leg had just gone to sleep. It was like having noodles for legs. The patient has been urinating almost non-stop which also started around 02:00, this was what woke him up. He had to crawl on hands and knees after falling to get into the bathroom, he had no strength except a smidgen of strength in the right leg. On 18Mar2021, while eating dinner, he had trouble holding his fork and did not think much about it. He had a cramp feeling in right hand. Today, while eating lunch with a fork, he also had a difficulty. The patient eats with his right hand. The patient has been trying to learn how to walk since early this morning. He has worn out his wife since she was cleaning up after him in the bathroom and helping him walk. He couldn&#39;t walk to the commode very well, couldn&#39;t hold his water, and has been making a mess all day. He was at first afraid he was having a stroke but had no stroke symptoms. The patient reported that his weight was 201, then mentioned that during the night he thought about how much he was urinating and got on the scale out of curiosity and it said he weighs 191. At this time, his leg weakness persists but he was able to stand and hold his own body weight. Issue with holding fork and cramp feeling in right hand was persisting. Urinating was persisting and stated he was going about every 2 hours and goes a lot. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 17Mar2021; unknown for stroke, fall, and weight loss; and not recovered for all other events.

Admission to ER for suspected cardiac event.  Intense pain continues for 4.5 hours despite multiple administrations of fentanyl. ER tests negative for heart attack. CT interpretation does not rule out suspected aortic dissection due to fluid around aneurysm (later ruled out with second CT). Transfer to another Hospital for possible cardiac repair. Surgeon disagrees with CT reading. Three days in ICU and Step Down, CT, Cardiac Echo, Carotid Echo, Chest X Ray, Blood Tests all negative for cardiac event.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

                                                Patient received first dose of COVID vaccine at 1800 and waited 15 minutes and left on his own accord.  He sat in his car a few more minutes with his wife not feeling as if he was completely well.  He returned to the clinic reporting tightness in his neck and throat area.  His blood pressure was taken 189/99.  He did not have difficulty breathing or any other signs of anaphylaxis but was given 50mg of benadryl as a precaution.  We continued to monitor blood pressure for 30 minutes and did not resolve.  He has a history of high blood pressure but reports that it is controlled by taking Metoprolol and Amlodipine daily.  Physician was consulted and felt it was best to be seen in the ER.  The patient was transported to ER by his wife and seen.

                                                when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain; feel a little tightness in his breathing/ tightness/shortness of breath; on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%; feel a little bit of heat on his forehead; nose dripping/nose was running; seems like it isn&#39;t working; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine &#34;seems like it isn&#39;t working&#34;. The patient stated it doesn&#39;t look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor&#39;s arms are so sore and &#39;blah blah&#39; and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn&#39;t feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn&#39;t know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven&#39;t been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn&#39;t normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn&#39;t immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn&#39;t been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and &#39;on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%&#39; was recovering, &#39;when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain&#39; was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

The paramedic and I looked up and  noticed a sudden change in mental status- dropped his phone and started making slight grunting noises as well as turning pale. We rescued the patient, got the stretcher and he became  lucid. His activity was seizure like  (petit mal). I  called the ED charge nurse, provided report, and the patient was transported via paramedic X 2 to the ED for an evaluation.

Subsequent muscle aches and general soreness without fever the following day (Feb. 10, 2021). Historical episodes of SVT typically last between 1-3 hours, and I had not had a recent SVT episode prior to vaccination. During the 15 hour SVT episode post vaccination, I experienced much higher than normal blood pressure readings and erratic blood glucose levels which cannot be explained by diet changes, even though I was still taking my prescribed medications on schedule.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

                                                He had the vaccine, and around 5:00 PM said he had weakness and he fell to the floor.  Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

A 70-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9265) intramuscular, on 01Feb2021 at 08:00 (at the age of 70 years old), for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 01Feb2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced severe hypoglycemic event (POC=38)/hypoglycemia and chest pain. He was found driving the wrong way down the highway with no memory of the event, once stopped by authorities. He was admitted to the hospital with hypoglycemia and chest pain. His home diabetes coverage was an insulin pump and there was denial of decreased PO intake. The insulin pump was stopped once the patient was admitted. His glucose improved and insulin regular SSI was initiated. He was brought for cardiac cath on 02Feb2021 with no new issues seen. The patient was stabilized, was set for follow-up with PCP and endocrinologist and discharged on 04Feb2021. The events resolved on an unspecified date in Feb2021.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

                                                Received shot on the 5th. - Friday On Saturday I started noticing my heart rate increased and my BP was up. Then it seem to go away. Then Sunday while at church I felt like it was acting up. By Sunday evening my BP and heart rate were jumping all over. The highest was BP 196/91 with a heart rate of 130. Like I said it was going up and down. I considered calling 911 but a nurse suggested I just monitor it as they would not do anything at the hospital but monitor me.  On Monday I stayed in contact with my cardiologist and these symptoms lasted till Wednesday morning. Since then everything has been great. I know they say the second dose is worse when it comes to reaction and part of me DOES not want to get the second dose. I have a Defibrillator / pacemaker and am starting to question the real need of this shot. Thank you

                                                Stroke; Dose Number 1 on 08Jan2021/Dose Number 2 on 25Jan2021; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient has no medical history. Concomitant medication included tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX). Patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) intramuscular on 08Jan2021 on the left arm. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at the hospital. On 18Jan2021 06:00, the patient experienced right foot drop. Spine MRI on 18Jan2021 was negative. Stroke confirmed on brain MRI on 28Jan2021. Patient was sent to the ED at the hospital immediately after and was admitted from the ED to the hospital. Number of days of hospitalization was 2. Adverse event result: doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Patient has not recovered from the event stroke. Event was reported as non-serious. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient has been tested for COVID-19 with test type: nasal swab on 28Jan2021 with result negative. Patient has no known allergies. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the event stroke mostly represented intercurrent condition in this patient with advanced age, unrelated to Bnt162b2. Relevant medical history and concurrent disease are missing for a medically meaningful assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Prior to his hospital admission, his previous one was 5/11/2020-5/14/2020. Please see below for hospital course at the Facility: 70 yo male with PMHx of COPD, CHFrEF 20%, CAD s/p MI and CABG in 1999, HLD, HTN, DM2, GERD, Anxiety and Depression who presented with increased shortness of breath to facility. Transfered on 3/13 to the facility. Noted increased SOB without CP, palpitations, cough, orthopnea or PND. No history of home O2 use but required 2-3L O2 during this hospital stay. Was noted on admit to Facility to have troponin elevation with unchanged EKG. Was started on NSTEMI protocol with heparin ggt, ASA, BB, and statin. Initially received one dose ceftriaxone/azithro for possible PNA. On admission, primary team held home BB. On arrival to Facility, troponin at 3.998 trended to 4.442 and then trended down. underwent CTA to evaluate for PE that was negative. CXR and CT showed pulmonary edema consistent with HF exacerbation and a proBNP 8613. Patient was given 40mg IV lasix x2. RRT was called twice, once for BP 80/50 treated with 500ml IVF, and second for CP that resolved with NTG and tramadol. Cardiology was consulted with goal to cath patient, however some concern for medication adherence going forward so they will reevaluate. Patient began to have tachycardia with rates in the 150s sustained and hypotension. EKG showed likely sinus tachycardia with wide QRS similar to prior EKGs. Patient has ICD in place that was interrogated and showed good function. IV metoprolol 5mg given x3 with rated decrease to upper 120s. Patient remained asymptomatic, awake, and alert. Per discussion with wife after transfer, patient BP has been in the 50s systolic at home for the last month. Cardiac cath was performed showing 99% stenosis of LCX. Did not tolerate procedure with nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. RRT was called after cath procedure. He is nauseous, diaphoretic. He complained of chest pressure. STAT EKG obtained. Noted ST depressions in the septal leads significant from before. Cardiology concerned pt was having an inferior MI.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

Poured a cup of coffee and sat down on living room chair four feet from me. He slumped over. I went to him and tried to wake him but he had passed out. Could not tell if he was breathing. I called 911. Put phone on speaker. I was told to lay him in the floor and start chest compressions.  I did this for about 4 minutes when he made some noise.  The first sheriff arrived after 8 minutes and by then PT had started to come around. He rolled over on his side and spoke to the sheriff. A couple minutes after that the ambulance arrived and the EMTs took over. They got him up and in the chair. Checked his pulse, blood sugar, blood pressure and did two EKGs. Everything was normal. He of course did not remember what happened but was very coherent. His conversation was very normal. They stayed with him about 30 minutes and he chose not to go to the hospital. He was out about 10 minutes. He has since been to the doctor and checked out fine.

                                                Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus; Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; COVID-19 confirmed by positive COVID-19 test / COVID pneumonia; blood clot; blood pressure was low; Respiratory arrest; Respiratory failure; Hypoxemia; ventricular tachycardia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting on behalf of the husband. A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

After receiving the vaccine the patient went to the recovery area for the required 15 minutes. About 10 minutes later his breathing rapidly increased - eventually turning to large gasps of air. The patient then briefly passed out but then quickly woke up. He then started vomiting for the next 10 minutes. Eventually he recovered enough to walk with the help of his wife. The wife stated that he has had episodes like this from other vaccines and blood draws. He has never vomited from the episodes, however.

Rushed him to Urgent Care, they sent him home and the next day I took him to ER. He was admitted. MRIs, CT scan, Blood Cultures, 2 Covid tests.  Nothing definitive as to why he was so ill other then a viral infection.   We are not assuming or indicating it is vaccine related but we think it&#39;s worth noting.  Nothing in his routine had changed other then receiving the 1st vaccine.   No one at the hospital indicated it was related.

                                                stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable pharmacist.  A 71-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly at the age of 71-years, at single dose in right arm on 02Apr2021 09:00 (Lot number: EP7533) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported and there were no known allergies. Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban (XARELTO); empagliflozin (JARDIANCE); lisinopril all taken for an unspecified indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly at the age of 71-years, at single dose in right arm on 05Mar2021 09:00 (Lot number: EN6199) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced stroke on 11Apr2021 (Stroke 7 days after injection (as reported)), it resulted in &#34;Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event) and Disability or permanent damage&#34;. The patient was hospitalized for stroke for 2 days. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination and he had not been tested for COVID since the vaccination. Event outcome was not recovered.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke is likely due to an underlying medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2. Although temporally related, there is no sufficient evidence that the reported stroke is related to BNT162B2. Note that the patient&#39;s medical history was not reported, however, patient is taking rivaroxaban and lisinopril for unspecified indication. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 71-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 06Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included liver transplant, Patient&#39;s liver transplant was 6 years ago. A-Fib from an unknown date. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital in (Name). Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter believes that patients sister has A-Fib. There were no concomitant medications. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Patient received a flu vaccine way back in Aug2020. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was Not provided.

On Thursday, usual fatigue, that people get, Friday morning, diarrhea 1 bout, and dizziness, gave him water, HR erratic 80, 90 to 70 into 100, which as like AFib, BP went to 64/55, put in in w/c had him lay down, hand cold, weak, drain. He drank electrolyte water. started to take BP and HR and Oxygen level, his Blood pressure was 64/55, She called PCP, the nurse got on the phone and asked questions, and monitor what had happened, monitored Heart rate until 20 minutes it became regulated, in the 90s and staying in the 90s. If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue. Early Friday morning, he woke up patient had one bout of diarrhea. Then patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit. Patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 90s at least it was fluctuating within the 90s. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient also had low blood pressure. The patient continued to drink cold water, and the reporter was monitoring him. The patient did not go into A-Fib again the next day. Reporter has called several people. Reporter has called transplant people, and patients primary care physician. Reporter was asking them questions about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they thought it was an allergic reaction. Reporter asked them if it could happen again with the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital. Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress.

He had to go to the emergency room as he could not breathe and he was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolism in both lung on 07Apr2021, no precipitating of event, no logical explanation that the doctors could tell, they put him on Eliquis to recover up the blood clots, 19 days later 26Apr2021 he was back in to ER. He was severe headache, nausea, vomiting. Side effects of the blood thinner. He was diagnosed with cerebral hemorrhage on 26Apr2021. We flight to hospital because we live in a small town no neuro surgeon available to get immediate surgery. The doctor told he was calm down, but they took him off from blood thinners and she don&#39;t know what she expect more blood clot, what going next, he feels fine, he still had some headache which doctor said it would leave the month because of the blood in the brain. There was no after explaining and no logical explanation what have happen other than the blood thinner, he could take blood thinner. She don&#39;t know why the clots come back, that&#39;s why she want to report this because this all way comes on with the Pfizer. He was fine with the other vaccine that have five weeks after later. When probed any question regarding side effects, reporter stated, well she just kind a need to know, what to expect. If this going to be ongoing thing with in and out of ER. What to expect, we don&#39;t know. Doctor was following up. He has Hematology appointment on Wednesday to try to figure out the consequences. Reporter stated, she was on hold for 40 minutes and she could not even report this as a serious possible adverse reaction of the vaccine and to the drug. He merely died twice. When probed was patient still experiencing the side effects, reporter stated, well he was still tired. He still have the headache it&#39;s not severe. He went to the emergency room. We are watching him on helping here to follow up. He was taking medication of anti-seizure Keppra because body has strains body so that&#39;s making him tired. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I was put in ICU under blood thinner Heparin drip treatment. On 5/09/21, I was discharged to go home to continue treatment with blood thinner Eliquis.  I have always been an active healthy person with no major issues other than one Stent put in my Left Descending Artery by doctor in June of 2013. I&#39;ve been playing Tennis (mostly singles) on weekends till last November and I&#39;ve been playing Ping Pong on weekdays till end of April. Never expected to getting this PE. Could this blood clots be the result of Pfizer Covid Vaccine ?

                                                Patient expired. Per Emergency MD note: &#34;This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.&#34;

He suddenly did not know where is was, how he got there, or why he was there. He continuously asked those questions throughout the balance of the day. The nurses on duty in the clinic got a wheel chair and escorted us to the  hospital ER in the same building. He was immediately taken to a room where a doctor met us and began asking him questions. The Dr quickly ordered a multitude of tests. Results shown in item 19

                                                The day after the vaccine, I just had a mild headache and mild leg aches, off and on, and took Advil twice with complete relief. Then I was fine until 7th day when I awoke a 7am. I felt mentally &#34;weird&#34; and couldn&#39;t concentrate. Not dizzy. I ate my normal breakfast of lox, cream cheese and bread with coffee with cream and Stevia. I sat at the computer and could not concentrate or even read well, and felt confused at times. Then I got hot and sweaty, my mouth got very dry, I had pains and needles over my entire body, and the tip of my tongue got numb. I laid down in my bed and felt worse. My blood pressure was 160-170/105-110, and normally it is 120-135-70-84.  I thought maybe I was having a neurological event, so I had my wife take me to the ER. I was there about 6 hours, but after about 3-4 hours, let better. The symptoms would come and go, lasting 3-5 minutes, and slowly improved. After the 2nd treponin was negative, they let me go home. I felt tired and mentally off a little. I rested. The next am, I was back to normal and have stayed OK since.

It was further reported that about 8 days after the first one, the patient started noticing gradually being short of breath. He would walk for 50 yards and he would be huffing and puffing, which was unusual, because he could walk a lot. It gradually got worse and then after the second one, it continued to get worse and he finally ended up in the hospital for 3 days with multiple pulmonary emboli on an unspecified date. The reporter was asking if this had been reported with the vaccine. The patient was hospitalized for the event multiple pulmonary emboli on an unspecified date for 3 days. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.

                                                Pulmonary embolism; Multiple clots in his lungs; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife). A 72-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number unknown and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (EL8982) on 19Jan2021. The reporter (wife) stated that she and her husband both took the Covid vaccine. The patient (husband) is the one who have the adverse reactions. On 19Jan2021, she and her husband had the first shot, the Pfizer Covid shot. On 10Feb2021, they had the second shot. Just today she picked her husband from the hospital, they dismissed him for today because on 18Feb2021, she had to take him to emergency room because he had pulmonary embolism. He has multiple clots in his lungs. This is nothing that they dealt before with him. The reporter is afraid that it might be related to have taken the vaccine. Reporter stated that when she took him to the emergency room, it was 18Feb2021. Now he had a little shortness of breath for few days before the 18th but they didn&#39;t realize that he was having a big problem. He fully developed this on 18Feb2021. The reason for hospitalization was pulmonary embolism and blood clots in his lungs. He is little bit slow like the reporter said she got him to the hospital where he stayed 3 days she guess with pulmonary embolism, from 18Feb2021 to 21Feb2021. He had lot a of lab work while he was in hospital on these days the wife described. He had blood work, Echocardiogram, CAT scan, Ultrasounds, Chest X-ray, Covid rapid test, they haven&#39;t got back the result yet. Outcome of the events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar event for 3 patients (for herself, her husband and their doctor). This is 1st of three reports (husband case) and only this case is serious. A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure abnormal; both from 2007 and ongoing; about 13-14 years, he does not take insulin, he takes oral medication. The consumer is calling for her husband who is in the hospital. His symptoms started after Covid 19 injection. He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

                                                Patient reported he did not have any significant reactions to the first dose of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine given on 3/3/21. I have counseled patient on possible side effects and patient said he has no question. He looked fine after receiving the vaccine. However, after about 5 minutes, the wife who also received the second dose at the same time said he&#39;s not feeling well. I immediately went to check on patient and asked how he is feeling. Patient said he is feeling dizzy but has no problem in breathing. Wife and I were supporting patient in case he fell. I directed technician to call 911 and call for support from the front. Patient looked pale and hands were shaking. I kept talking to patient to keep his attention because he looked like he was about to faint. I had wife removed his mask in case if he had trouble breathing. Patient said he felt better after sitting for awhile. I checked his BP which was 68/48 and HR was 49. Patient said his normal BP was over 130. EMT arrived and checked his vitals and took him to ER due to low BP and HR. I called to follow up with patient after 6 hours. I spoke with wife who indicated that ER monitored patient and discharged him. Since he got home, he threw up 2-3 times but he was ok when I called and was resting. I counseled wife to ensure he stayed hydrated and if he gets worse, then she needs to take him to the hospital again. Within an hour, wife came to the pharmacy and said she&#39;s taking her husband to the hospital again. Wife has no reaction to second dose. She said she took aspirin just in case but she is fine.

                                                Passed out; cardiac event; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer from a Pfizer-sponsored program COVAX Support. A 72-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 05Feb2021 15:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included defibrillator insertion from 2014 to an unknown date (has never had it go off), blood pressure abnormal, heart disorder, blood cholesterol increased (Lipitor indication: to lower cholesterol), and eye disorder. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3246), on 15Jan2021, at 15:30 PM in the left arm, for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for heart from 2010 and ongoing; carvedilol taken for heart from 2014 and ongoing; ubidecarenone (CO Q 10) helps with the statin for his heart from 2014 and ongoing; atorvastatin (LIPITOR) taken to lower cholesterol from 2014 and ongoing; lisinopril taken for blood pressure from 2014 and ongoing; xantofyl (LUTEIN) taken for eye from an unspecified start date and ongoing; and warfarin taken as blood thinner from 2010 and ongoing. The patient reported that 2 hours and 15 minutes after the second dose on 05Feb2021, he passed out and his defibrillator kicked in and he had a cardiac event but was not sure what kind of cardiac event. He stated it was probably unrelated, but the doctor said to call Pfizer to notify. He said he has had the defibrillator since 2014 and has never had it go off. He is having a stress test to check it all out. He added he felt great by about two hours after the defibrillator kicked in and went golfing. The outcome of the events was recovered on 05Feb2021.

                                                I woke up the morning of February 16, 2021 with my heart beat racing (resting rate 130&#43; bpm&#39;s).  So I went ahead and did several readings with a Kardia device which showed AFIB, Tachycardia, and PVCs. I have those readings available upon request. The cause is likely from my second Covid 19 shot that was given to me Saturday, February 13, 2021. I cannot think of any other variables that would have caused this irregular hear beat. Since this event occurred, I have been in regular contact with my Cardiologist. My daily ekg&#39;s are showing frequent arrhythmias, mostly PVCs.  I&#39;m currently going through a series of tests to determine a course of action going forward (CT Cardiac Scoring, EKG&#39;s, Echocardiogram, etc.)

                                                In march I started becoming SOB and it continued to progress.  It became so bad that I could only walk about 5-10 feed before becoming totally exhausted, needing to sit down for a few minutes.  My heart rate remained sinus-tach running up to 120&#39;s.  On March 4, 2021 I had an appointment with Dr.   He sent me to the Hospital to have a CTA.  The test was positive for a MASSIVE bilateral PE.  Doppler studies of my lower extremities showed a partially occluded Palpitate vein in my right leg.  I was admitted to the hospital and started on Heparin IV.  I was also taken to the Cath- lab where I underwent a Thrombectomy of my right lung.  The Cath-lab quit working so the procedure was stoped and the left lung was not treated.  On admission to the hospital my O2 sat was 97%.  After the thrombectomy my O2 sat went to 83%.  I was placed on Hiigh-flow O2 via nasal cannual.  On March 8th I was started on Lovenox SQ for 30 day and discharged from the hospital on March 9th.  I am now on Eliquis 5 mg bid and doing much better.

Tee revealed no cardiac source of embolism. He is left with some expressive and receptive aphasia. He also has some loss of L eye vision. There was no stenosis of the carotid arteries but the left M2 branch was occluded. He did not have any atrial fibrillation in the hospital but is wearing a 30 day monitor currently.   We have no idea this was related to the vaccine but wanted to report. The Neurologist thinks it is just a coincidence.  But we still want you to know it happened.

                                                Beginning the day after the inoculation, my husband began feeling worse in terms of his difficulty in breathing.  He used the  Albuterol inhaler more than usual.  It progressively got worse over the next 2 weeks, ending with my husband?s sudden collapse and death exactly 2 weeks later on April 5, 2021.  The inoculation may or may not have been directly linked to his unexpected death, but I feel it may have exasperated his condition, which led to his death.   And I feel it is important to report this to you.  I later heard that he should not have been using his Albuterol inhaler one week prior to receiving the Pfizer vaccine.  I don?t know if that is true, but that information was never told to my husband, if it is.

                                                I have a history of previous parox. at. fibrillation but none for the last year.  A few hours after 2nd covid injection, along with  mild myalgias/prodromal sx., I went into atrial fib., with mild tach. but no other problems.  The arrythmia persisted for ~24 hr.s then converted back to sinus rhythm-- and fine since.  This event is more of an interesting observation than an &#34;adverse event&#34; but as the spike protein binds to ACE2 receptors, I thought the two events might be related and possibly of interest to you.

The vaccination station administered Epi and brought him to the ED for further evaluation.  At 12:27, patient was feeling improved and left ED. The ED physician offered steroids and he did not want anything prescribed.  He was instructed to return if symptoms worsen or do not improve.  After he left the ED, he called his PCP and stated that the ED was no help and they had tried the CDC and Health department with no luck.  Patient informed his PCP that he is experiencing elevated BP, dry sore throat, and dizziness to the point of passing out.  The conversation between the patient and provider are ongoing at this time.

A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose  of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 12:45 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included borderline prehypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) and enalapril maleate (ENALAPRIL MALEATE). The patient previously took anticoagulant citrate dextrose and experienced drug hypersensitivity. After the patient received the vaccine, the patient felt OK, just fatigued the rest of the day, nothing out of the ordinary for a vaccination. Patient woke up early in 14Jan2021, 06:00 with some minor heart palpitations. As the day progressed, they got more frequent and lasted longer (had one about every hour and half and they lasted 20 to 30 minutes). By the evening of 14Jan2021 he told his wife about the problem. In the morning of 15Jan2021 it&#39;s still occurring but not as frequently, but they did last just as long. By evening they were less frequent and lasting quite a bit shorter (10 to 15 minutes). On 16Jan2021, it only happened about a dozen times and lasted less than 5 minutes. On 17Jan2021, he only had a couple of occurrences. Today (18Jan2021), by 12:45 PM, patient  have had only 2 occurrences. The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient did not have Covid prior to vaccination and was not tested positive prior and post vaccination.

A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included heart rate irregular and blood pressure high. Concomitant medications were none. The patient said he had an irregular heartbeat after getting his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021. He said he had to go to the Emergency Room on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He clarified he checked his blood pressure at home and his blood pressure was low at 91/73. He said he also had a high pulse rate of 160, or better, for 9-1/2 hours. He said the only thing he can attribute his low blood pressure and high pulse rate to is the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he hasn&#39;t heard anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine being related to having an effect on the heart, but he personally believes it was his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose that caused his low blood pressure and high pulse rate. He clarified after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021, he had a sore right arm after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, fatigue, tiredness, and nausea. He said on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he recognized a small amount of chills, feeling feverish without having a fever, and sweating. He said his wife checked his temperature a few times on Saturday, 30Jan2021, and he never had a fever, but he felt clammy. He said he had noticed the nausea more than anything else. He said he maybe should have checked his blood pressure on Saturday, 30Jan2021. He said he didn&#39;t check his blood pressure until Sunday morning, 31Jan2021, and when he saw his low blood pressure and high pulse rate, he called the hospital and eventually drove to the Emergency Room. He said by the time he had got to the Emergency Room his blood pressure had went up to &#34;100 and something&#34;, but his pulse rate never changed, and his pulse was still 160. He said the doctor gave him several medications to try to get his pulse rate to come down. He said the doctor had given him a medication that was supposed to bring his pulse down. He said then the doctor had to add something else in a syringe to go with the other medication to bring his pulse down. He said he wasn&#39;t sure of the medication&#39;s name. He clarified he never noticed his pulse rate was high until he took his blood pressure on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he felt the nausea start later Friday evening (29Jan2021). He said he already has stomach trouble anyways that he takes medicine for, so he took a pill, but the nausea continued. He clarified he took 1 Omeprazole 20mg capsule that was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, but stated the Omeprazole 20mg prescription looked like it expired in 2017. He said he knows he has a newer Omeprazole prescription, but did not know where the prescription bottle was. He reported on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he just laid around. He said he did not feel as bad on Saturday, as he did on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he called the Emergency Room on Sunday morning, and went to the Emergency Room. He said he didn&#39;t feel his 160 pulse rate. He said he was told by the doctor in the Emergency Room that his fast heart rate had his heart beating like he was having a stress test. He reported he doesn&#39;t know if he wants to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot after what he experienced this past weekend. He reported he only takes blood pressure medicine that he has  been on for a while. He reported he had several EKGs done on Sunday, 31Jan2021, while he was in the Emergency Room. He said the EKG showed Atrial Fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 160s. He reported while he was in the Emergency Room he was given IV Heparin, IV Potassium, Potassium pills, and Amiodarone in a pill and IV form. He said the doctor added another IV medicine in a syringe, but he doesn&#39;t know the name of the medicine. He said the doctor also gave him IV Morphine because he had pain in his chest. He said the doctor said his chest pain was being caused by his heart trying to go back into a regular rhythm.  He reported he was in the Emergency Room for 11-12 hours before he was admitted to the hospital. He said his pulse rate wasn&#39;t coming down and stayed at 160 for 9-1/2 hours. He said the doctor wanted to admit him to the hospital, so he could have a procedure to make sure the high pulse rate didn&#39;t damage his heart. He said on Monday, 01Feb2021, he had a procedure where they went through his wrist and put a dye in his heart to see if the stress from his high pulse rate damaged his heart. He said his heart wasn&#39;t damaged, so he was discharged from the hospital later in the day on 01Feb2021. He clarified his blood pressure was good by the time the first or second EKG was performed in the Emergency Room. He clarified he already had an issue with sweating before he received his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he is still sweating, but he doesn&#39;t know if that is because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical outcome of high pulse rate and blood pressure low was recovered on 31Jan2021; nausea, fatigue/tiredness recovered on 02Feb2021; chills, feeling feverish recovered on an unspecified date; sweating was not recovered; while for the other events was unknown.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

                                                Patient received his first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine.  Patient was screened and given vaccine with no incident.  Patient was waiting in observation area for 30 mins post the vaccine.  About 10 mins post vaccination patient felt sick to his stomach and spit up into his mask.  He called pharmacy staff over and we gave garbage pale to spit up into.  He spit up approximately 10ml of orange phlegm and that was all.  He asked for water to rinse his mouth so staff gave him a little bit of water to rinse with.  Pharmacist stayed with patient and monitored him for additional adverse effects.  Pharmacist took patient&#39;s blood pressure which was 174/98 at 3:21pm 14 mins post vaccination and a second time 19mins post vaccination at 3:26pm it was 150/90.  Patient reported having history of acid reflux and he had just had orange juice and Jax (cheetos) so he believed it was due to what he ate.  We continued to monitor patient.  He stated he was feeling fine and wanted to leave.  Pharmacist asked to recheck his BP at which he declined saying he was feeling fine and the 150/90 is normal for him.  The pharmacist help to escort the patient to the front registers to make sure he was not experiencing anything else and at that time patient stated he felt fine and was leaving the store.

                                                blacked out; scraped his face; light headaches; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 17Feb2021 03:00 (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2008 and ongoing and reported that it&#39;s under control. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient was calling because he got his shot through the (facility name withheld) on the 17Feb2021 around 3:00. The caller goes for walks, and one week later he had a blackout, about the same time he got the shot 3:00 or 3:15 on 24Feb2021. The caller blacked out and he broke his glasses, scraped his face, all that stuff. All the scrapes were healing. The weirdest thing was it happened almost exactly a week later. The caller asked was it possible that this could be related to the vaccine. For the following two days after the vaccine the caller had 2 light headaches on 18Feb2021 and then they were gone on 19Feb2021. This blackout event happened one time. Caller mentioned the headaches were nothing to be concerned about. The caller was not given a vaccination card at the (facility name withheld) and does not know the lot number, NDC number, or expiration date. This was the caller&#39;s first dose of the vaccine. The caller mentioned that 11Mar2021 was his next appointment for the second dose of the vaccine. The caller has never had a black out episode or dizziness before. The caller said he licked his wounds and will be okay. No visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office required. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No relevant tests done. The outcome was recovered on 19Feb2021 for the event Headache; and recovering for the other events.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 73-year-old male patient (husband) received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EM9810), intramuscularly administered in arm left on 06Feb2021 at age of 73 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial flutter, cardiac ablation from Jan2020, tooth infection, root canal, ongoing prostate issues. Concomitant medication included tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX) taken for prostate issues from an unspecified start date and ongoing, medication for nasal congestion (He had a lot of sinus issues. It was mainly nasal sprays that he used). The patient previously took penicillin BK for tooth infection, clindamycin for tooth infection, amoxicillin for tooth infection, paracetamol (TYLENOL) for pain. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation on 16Feb2021. This case was a serious report with Seriousness criteria-Caused/prolonged hospitalization. Reporter said that her husband got the first dose of the vaccine on 06Feb2021 and on 15Feb2021 he went to the cardiologist. She said that he had a history of atrial flutter and had an ablation over a year ago in Jan2020. She said that he went in for a routine check. She said that he had been off of his cardiac medications because he was doing fine after the ablation. The doctor told him to follow up in a year. On 16Feb2021, he started having weird things going on with his heart. He took some medication to help the rate of his heart. Reporter clarified that he took Metoprolol (TOPROL XL) 50mg that he had in the house. The doctor told him to take it in case something happened. She said that there was the chance that he had Afib and was just asymptomatic. They never saw any evidence of Afib previously though, just AFlutter. He had no episodes of Afib. She said that previously he went off of his medications and was doing ok. They were told to buy a watch that monitors his heart rate. Reporter said that when she checked his heart rate on the pulse ox it was 180. She called an ambulance and he was admitted to the hospital for atrial fibrillation. She said that they had to do a cardioversion in the ambulance on the way there and it was a significant occurrence. Her husband experienced Afib about 10 days later after the vaccine, was cardioverted on the way to the hospital and was hospitalized due to atrial flutter. Reporter stated doctor told them they didn&#39;t see any correlation with the vaccine. Reporter wanted to know if these symptoms were reported before. She said that during this period of time, he had been on 3 different antibiotics for a tooth infection and had a root canal. She said that he took these from the beginning of Jan2021 for about a week each. She said that his tooth infection was not any better or was worse and they would try another antibiotic. Reporter clarified that the antibiotics were Penicillin BK first, then he was on Clindamycin the second time, then was on Amoxicillin the 3rd time. He was also on Tylenol 3 for the pain during this as well.  The patient took 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EM6198) intramuscularly in the Left arm on 01Mar2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The outcome of events was unknown.

The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated he did not know what date the blood clots occurred and can&#39;t tell when that happened, but it was maybe a few weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. He stated that one blood clot is in the right leg near the calves and the blood clot broke and split some and went up into the side of his lung as it was detected in a doppler on 27Feb2021. The patient was hospitalized from 27Feb2021 to 28Feb2021. The doppler was performed as soon as he went into the emergency room and they went through a series of tests with unknown results on 27Feb2021 and 28Feb2021. The patient stated that the right leg is bigger than the other leg and they told him it might stay that size and may not go down. The patient is now on apixaban (ELIQUIS) 5 mg for the rest of his life. In the beginning, they gave him an unspecified shot in his stomach, then after that he began taking apixaban at two pills in the morning and two pills at night, then they cut him down to 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill in the evening, and he started it right when he went into the hospital immediately. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of blood clots after the 2nd dose and blood clot split and some went into side of lung was unknown.

                                                two blood clots in his right calf; It is painful; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 73-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left at 10 am on 16Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single; dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left at 10 am on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single, both for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing varicose vein (for years, barely noticeable). No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced two blood clots in his right calf on 27Apr2021, it is painful. The event &#39;two blood clots in his right calf&#39; was reported as serious and seriousness criteria were medically significant and disability. He said it is better today once he started apixaban (ELIQUIS). He did not know if that was physical or mental. The adverse event required a visit to physician office. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sonogram on leg: unknown results. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Dec2020 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He was an ER doctor and the medical director of his hospital. The patient was asymptomatic when he got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. 3 hours after the vaccine he began to get chills, HA, anorexia, myalgias, and extreme fatigue. This worsened and he slept all and had no appetite. On 19Dec2020 he woke up delirious with a fever and was ataxic, hypoxic, incontinent, and confused. The patient was hospitalized due to the events on 15Dec2020. The events also caused prolonged hospitalization due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab post vaccination with unknown results. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as the patient required oxygen, plasma, and remdisivir.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, BNT162B2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of reported serious events might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

CBGs 330s-530s since. Less than 1 mo ago when here for DM his CBGs were 115-130s. No other medication, dietary changes, or illness to account for the abrupt change. Also reports he had vision loss on drive home following the vaccine administration. Vision loss resolved spontaneously after approx. 30 min. Presented to clinic for evaluation 01/05/21 for above listed symptoms. Concern for possible HHS/DKA so was sent to ER. Labs ruled out DKA/HHS, was given IVF and insulin, discharged home to to follow up in next few days.

Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient&#39;s official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

                                                Extreme fast heart beat 140-150 occurred 4:00am in evening after 2:00pm previous day vaccine Accelerated heart rate lasted for 7-8 minutes after taking an 12.5 mg metoprolol pill This was followed by shakes for a few hours Concerned about taking 2nd dose in light of supposed more pronounced reactions  Worry about extreme heart rate not returning to normal, Afib or even worse Would ask if you would advise not to take 2nd dose If okay to take 2nd dose I would want to take it in a hospital setting -  Hospital which also administers Pfizer vaccine - Can you schedule here for me? Thank you

                                                I got the shot and started to feel light headed, they put  me in a little area and took my BP its 192/110. I had a little grab in my chest. I was there for 15 mins. They called the EMT and took me across the street to the ER. They did blood test and EKG and my BP was still high when I got there. The EKG and BP. x-ray of my heart was ok. They had to keep me there 4 hours to re-do test to make sure I didn&#39;t have a heart attack. MY BP was coming down but still high when they sent me home.  I sent an email to my PCP and she said there is a lot of side effects with the vaccine. After two days I was fine.

Developed pain in my abdomen area quite noticeable 4 days later.  6 days later had major pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea.  Went to ER morning of the 7th day....spent 4 days in hospital.  Had a blood clot--Portal Vein Thrombosis.  Put on Heparin drip in hospital...and Eliquis blood thinners after released.  I have never been sick like that...never been on any prescription...always been healthy, walking 3-5 miles per day.   My family feels that there must be a connection with the vaccine.  One of my doctors said no...another said didn&#39;t think so, but unknown at this time.

A 74-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot Number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 19Feb2021 14:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on 29Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced a sore shoulder. A few years ago he got 2 at the same time, he got a flu shot and a pneumonia shot on the same day. He felt really bad for part of a day. He felt unwell that was years ago. he does not have any brand name, manufacturer name or lot number expiration information to provide for these vaccines from years ago.  The patient experienced bell&#39;s palsy on 25Feb2021. There is a drooping eye, his eye didn&#39;t fully close but his lip wasn&#39;t right and the doctor said no because it could be a stroke ( unspecified date in Feb2021), go to the ER and that is where he was diagnosed was in the hospital ER. He was discharged home from the emergency room. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                First episode 2/21 [26 hours after 2nd shot].  Dull Chest pain.  Took 2 Tylenol and it went away.  Eleven days later,  chest pain returns but pain radiates up back into neck and head.  Took 2 Tylenol and went to bed.   Pain subsides.  Next 3 days pain repeats from chest to  head.  Fourth day I start to shiver internally.  This lasted about 75 minutes before going away..  Next day went to ER.  All ER tests were negative and was released.  Went to cardiologist and had a stress test and several other tests that were all normal.   A week later, I thought I was having a heart attack and went back to ER.  All tests were negative again.  Still wake up with neck pain  alleviated with Tylenol..

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 74years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL9262) on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 74years) for Covid-19 immunization and stated no reactions. Medical history included high blood pressure and diabetes but are all currently under control and feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered. It was reported that in the past the doctors thought he experienced TIA (transient ischemic attack) but wasn&#39;t sure if that was accurate. Concomitant medications included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL), trazodone (TRAZODONE), insulin (INSULIN), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and prednisone (PREDNISONE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that on 19Feb2021 the patient received the 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine and stated he remember feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered earlier. On Sunday 21Feb2021, the reporter (patient&#39;s wife) began noticing that the patient was showing symptoms of a stroke. The patient&#39;s one leg was rapidly kicking, and his speech began to slur. The patient was then rushed to ER (emergency room) and hospitalized. At the hospital it was confirmed that the patient was having a stroke. The patient recovered and was doing rehab for his leg. Few weeks later, the patient had an accident in his home while getting up to go to the bathroom and fell. The patient was rushed to the Trauma center. The patient&#39;s wife was upset as she carried their vaccine cards to the trauma center to confirm to staff that the patient did not need another Covid vaccine shot and later found out that the patient was given a 3rd (Moderna Covid vaccine) at the trauma center. The patient stated that he does not think the vaccine was related but was upset that the trauma center did not listen to her to take the info with the complete vaccine card present to avoid 3rd shot from another brand. The patient&#39;s insulin levels are under control, but the reporter was concerned when the patient does not eat within a certain timeframe. The outcome of events stroke and speech disorder was recovered on an unspecified date; outcome of event fall was unknown.

I then got a cold compress and had him lay back with feet up and put cold compress on his nose and a small ice bag on his forehead and for a little bit when I took the tissue from left nostril that is where the blood was coming form and i saw that there was clotted blood.  After changing the cold compress on his head the nosebleed began to subside and he continue to sit with his head back but when he sat up after about a half hour it started to bleed again out of the left nostril and that is what he has began experiencing. whenever he sits up it begins again it begins but no clotted blood.

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

He told his doctor about the COVID Shot another one scheduled in two weeks, the 14th two weeks from today and they recommended that he postpones it for three months. The patient had unspecified lab work done, and showing Iron was little bit low but nothing to be concerned about and his sugar was a little high that is because he was taking taking a steroid (Unspecified Medication). The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported sugar high was due to unspecified concomitant steroid, and was unrelated to the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE).

Clinical course was the follows the next day on 01Feb2021 at 9:30AM the patient was dressed and ready to go to dialysis. His oxygen dropped too low to 76. He wanted an ambulance called. He went into the hospital. The patient was confused, and he was not normally confused. In the hospital the physicians said he had pneumonia, but it wasn&#39;t that bad. The doctors were baffled. He also was in the hospital for something with toxins. He had a lung problem for a long time. If he didn&#39;t go to the bathroom the toxins were hitting the liver and then the toxins were going to the brain. When he was in the hospital he couldn&#39;t eat or swallow. The first day he did eat a bit, but he had dialysis in the hospital, and it knocks him out. They were giving him antibiotics IV. He couldn&#39;t swallow any of his pills. He was in there for 11 days and had not eaten. He couldn&#39;t swallow any pills. He started going to sleep and they started giving him Morphine drip at the end. They couldn&#39;t get any medicine in him because he couldn&#39;t swallow. The patient died of pneumonia, the outcome of the other adverse events was unknown.

Subsequently developed rash 1 week later and was biopsied by Derm subsequently developed cellulitis of bx site and was given keflex. Then developed mouth ulcers/?thrush thought to possibly be Keflex side effect. Had fevers and chills week of 3/19, also body aches, anorexia, and malaise, on 4/13 he presented to ER with bilateral PE, Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Cold agglutinin disease) and eosinophilia and skin rash resembling livido reticularuis. He was initially reported to be thrombocytopenic with platelet down to 77 but with lots of clumping. Platelet manual count reveled platelet normal at 160, however it was done after patient received IVIG and prednisone. HIT serology came back strongly positive at 2.58 however equivocal (does not neutralize heparin), patient was then switched to Xarelto.

                                                Patient was a healthy 75 year old male when he got the shot.  Within  5 hours, he began to feel TIRED, which was an expected side effect. He felt tired for several days. Nine days later he went to Memorial Hermann ER in Kingwood, and they said he had pneumonia. They also said he had a &#34;small mass&#34; at the bottom of his lung and might want to get it checked out. On March 20, he developed a cough. On March 21 we went to a different ER and a CT scan showed he had plureal effusion.  On the next day he was short winded. He went back to the ER and they admitted him and transferred him to hospital by ambulance.  On March 23, 1.7 liters of fluid was drained from his lung and sent to be tested. On March 26 he was diagnosed with malignant plureal effusion. He passed out at the doctor office and tranferred to to another facility by ambulance. He remained there for 4 days for tests, and a port was put in to drain the fluid. On March 29 he was transferred .  They repeated many tests and did a bronchoscopy.  On April 1 they told him he had squamous cell carcinoma.  He came home on April 2. The doctor called and said they made a mistake he had small cell carcinoma.  He remained home until April 11, when he was taken back to  by ambulance.  He had gone from a healthy appearing individual on March 17 to a critically ill individual and he died on April 15.  Doctors had never seen cancer overtake a man in 28 days. 28 days!!!!  On March 22, he had a small mass at the bottom of his lung, and one week later, it was a mass so large, his lung could not be seen and his lung had collapsed.  Doctors assumed that the cancer was dormant and that the vaccine did something to wake it. It attacked my husband with a vengeance.  He never smoked.
