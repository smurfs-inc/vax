                                                DVT left calf; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician (patient). A 60-year-old male patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Intramuscular on 20Dec2020 08:00 at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Gastric reflux. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no covid tested post vaccination. Concomitant medications included omeprazole (PRILOSEC) and ergocalciferol (VIT D). The patient had not received other vaccine in four weeks. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis (DVT) left calf on 27Dec2020 09:00 which resulted emergency room visit. Treatment received for the event included Xarelto. The outcome of the event was not resolved.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is too limited to make a meaningful medical assessment hence, the events are conservatively assessed as related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 until further information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

She diagnosed &#34;Swollen sub-mandibular &amp; pre-auricular lymphatic nodes.&#34;  I am being treated with: 1) Erythromycin Ophth Oint 3.5GM 2) Prednisolone AC 1% Ophth Susp 5ML 3) Pataday  Doctor believes that my viral infection might be a result of the Covid 19 vaccine, and gives assurance that her treatment will resolve issues. She is unsure whether, or not, I am considered contagious during this time? Inquiries at the college were unfruitful.   I hope my reporting this is not a violation in any way. Many thanks.

Went home and still felt dizzy and then I felt like I need to pee  but I was very cold ,  urinated 3 more times thinking it was because it was due to being cold but doctor explained it was due to me drinking lost of water.  Went to bathroom and bassed out and woke up about an hour later, but during the fall I injured the neck by heating your head on the sink, back and broke my nose, when I woke up  I was still very dizzy. Also felt a fast heart rate,  chest pain, very nauseas and started sweating a lot.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including head CT/MRI and viral serologies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 61-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL9621), intramuscular on the left arm on 22Jan2021 (reported as 07:45 to 08:00) at a SINGLE DOSE for prevent COVID, at 61 years old. Medical history included triple bypass surgery from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime. Symptoms (unspecified which) reported as recurring and are notably worse at bedtime. Patient is hesitant to receive the second dose. The patient stated he just went to sleep and prayed and then when he woke the next day, at night it did it again. At night it comes and goes, and he still has it happen but not like the first time. He tried to describe that he was washing his hands and he almost passed out like on an unspecified date in Jan2021, he was going to lose his mind. Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown. Outcome of the events dizziness, &#34;feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his brain wanted to pop out of his head/ his brain wanted to swell up&#34;, felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy, and fever was reported as recovering.

History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                Have a cut in my leg which is very unusual; Saw a big cut in my feet; I was bleeding from somewhere; It was quite a lot of blood drawing out of my body; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 62-year-old male patient started to receive single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 09:00 for COVID-19 immunization; and adalimumab (HUMIRA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unspecified dose (injection every other month) for arthritis. Medical history included arthritis, blood pressure (abnormal), and blood cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol, olmesartan medoxomil, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL XL), and vitamins: ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride. Patient stated, &#34;The reason I am calling, I have just a concern that something happened to me. I did not pay much attention but now I have read the news one doctor died after getting this COVID Vaccine (Further details were not available over the call) I have a small incident happened to me the day after I received my first dose of the COVID Vaccine. I just wanted to get some information. You know what happened the next day night, in the evening I was taking a shower and all of sudden I was bleeding from somewhere. Lot of blood was coming out while I was toweling my body out. I couldn&#39;t find out where the blood is coming from. I checked, it&#39;s not from my urine, not from my rectum but it was quite a lot of blood drawing out of my body. Immediately, I called my wife into bathroom, then I squeezed my body then the bleeding stops. It was on 24Dec2020. You know my kids were at home. I don&#39;t want them to find it. The bleeding stopped and everything went away. Then I thought maybe it is something related to my GI. I went to my GI doctor yesterday to have a checkup, they don&#39;t know anything either but I am due for my second dose for next week Wednesday. Now I had this news about thrombocytopenia on this doctor died (Clarification unknown). So I am just afraid if there is anything related this. Do you have any explanation on how I bleed and where it bleed? It was lot of bleeding even my towel was full of blood.&#34; Patient wanted to see if anybody else had similar experience or if he get the second dose and he get the complication again. Patient was a medical technologist. He was doing ultrasounds. He was working in a pediatric hospital. Patient was not prescribed/recommended vaccination. &#34;Nobody recommended it. During my hospital. I am healthcare professional. So everybody in my hospital. I just went there and get it. I didn&#39;t ask my doctor.&#34; Patient added, &#34;You know everything I read about this case and then you know, I have a cut in my leg which is very unusual. I have never seen that. I don&#39;t know how it happened. You know all of sudden oneday I wake up and I saw a big cut in my feet also. So, I am just afraid (onset date not reported).&#34; The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch number is requested.

A 63-years-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 21Dec2020 14:40, at a single dose for Covid 19. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient has no prior vaccinations -within 4 weeks. The patient is an EEG technician. On 22Dec2020, the patient reported the next day he started to feel sluggish, chills, tired/fatigue, pain all over his body, patient mentioned he has lost weight everyday since he got the shot from 153 pounds to 142 pounds; then on Wednesday evening 23Dec2020, it was a nightmare, he got sweating; fever with a high of 101.4 Fahrenheit; he was running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; and he was so tired and fatigued. Added when he was getting up all that night he was having night sweats up to five times a night and chills; and his heart was pounding. The urination, heart pounding resolved the next day. All of these events have improved at the time of report (now) or gone away but he is still sweating once at night for the last two days and he is tired and fatigued. He stated that he is scheduled for the second dose on 11Jan2021 and he is concerned if he should take the vaccine. He mentioned that he was tested for COVID 19 on 18Dec2020 and the result was inconclusive. He went again 23Dec2020 they called him on 25Dec2020 and informed he was positive per the PCR test. He treated himself with 500mg acetaminophen (UPC 0904672059; lot OBE2896 and expiration Oct2021) and azithromycin Z-Pack (NDC 65862-641-69; Lot ZYSA20012-A; and expiration date Mar2022). The sample of the product is not available to be returned. Predisposing factor was that the patient&#39;s wife was at home and was sick too at the same time. She was tested Sunday with no results yet. The outcome of the events of fever recovered on 28Dec2020, sluggishness recovered on 29Dec2020, pain all over the body was recovered on 02Jan2021; running to the bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine and heart pounding were recovered on 24Dec2020, weight loss was not recovered, and for other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (4 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between event &#34;COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / SARS-CoV-2 test positive) and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded

Increase in metabolism leading to being warm all the time ( no sweating).  Two weeks after second vaccine and while experiencing the above symptoms, I had sudden palpitations with a rapid ventricular response ( 186 beats per minute), severe light headedness, ambulance transport to hospital leading to admission for two days.  This has never happened to me or any family members before.  Discharged from hospital after 2 days in normal rhythm.  Also at this time, taste has returned to normal and foggy feeling has improved.

                                                Recurrence of Atrial fibrillation; Recurrence of Atrial fibrillation; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient himself).  A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 25Jan2021 13:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included hyperlipidemia, GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), and atrial fibrillation, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had prior ablations for Afib. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. On 04Jan2021, 18:00, the patient took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications included dofetilide, diltiazem, loratadine, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), and omeprazole (OMEPRA); the patient received these medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 28Jan2021 02:00, the patient experienced recurrence of atrial fibrillation after 6 months, the last episode was within a month after an ablation. No treatment was received in response tot eh event. Outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported recurrence of atrial fibrillation was more likely due to natural recurrence of underlying atrial fibrillation, and unlikely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He states he is taking his ProAIr inhaler every hour and it helps for the hour, but after that his breathing gets worse. Patient states he gets SOB with lying down and walking. Patient was speaking in full sentences and states it was because he just took his inhaler medication. Patient states he is positive for chills onset Sunday. Patient did have his first dose of COVID vaccine on Thursday. Denies difficulty breathing on Thursday, and per patient could have started Saturday night. DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition:   1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation (HCC)  Patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on p.r.n. albuterol at home as well as nightly Spiriva, coming to the emergency department for evaluation of worsening shortness of breath over the last 3 days with associated tightness with his breathing.  On arrival to the emergency department, patient is sitting forward, tachypneic, prolonged expiratory phase with diffuse expiratory wheezing.  He is saturating low 90s on room air.  He is placed on 2 L nasal cannula for comfort.  He received 2 DuoNeb treatments with EMS as well as Solu-Medrol.  I am going to treated with a continuous nebulizer treatment and obtained laboratory workup as well as chest x-ray.  Vital sign show tachycardia which is likely from his albuterol treatment, he is mildly tachypneic, otherwise stable.   Patient&#39;s laboratory workup is reassuring, troponin is negative.  Chest x-ray does not show any consolidation.  Patient does have some improvement in his symptoms after his continuous nebulizer treatment.  His VBG is repeated after treatment and shows that his pCO2 is going down however he is still slightly acidotic with the pH of 7.28.  Patient reports that he still tight in his chest, improved however uncomfortable going home.  He is still significantly wheezing on my exam, given this I did discuss this case with emergency department observation who agreed to accept for admission.  COVID testing is negative.  Patient is admitted in stable condition. Pulmonary:     Comments: Patient is sitting forward in the stretcher, he is tachypneic, prolonged expiratory phase with expiratory wheezing in all lung fields.

The patient reported having a long history of paroxysmal afib, very fit, play tennis at the national level. Prior to vaccine have had 2-3 brief bouts of afib/year. Since getting first shot and again after the second shot, have had frequent afib/apc&#39;s (atrial premature contractions) at least 6 episodes. Adverse event start date was reported as 21Dec2020 at 02:00 AM (pending clarification). No treatment was given for the event. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, she has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event is considered possibly related to the suspect product based on the reportedly positive temporal association in a subject with a positive medical history of atrial arrhythmias.

On the day pt was vaccinated, his sister picked him up for the appointment and pt refused a wheelchair. Pt walked into the clinic on his own and recevied his vaccine. Sister reported pt walked to the car after his vaccine and was winded. She dropped him off at his house and called him later to check up on him. Pt stated he was feeling fine but his arm was sore. Pt&#39;s sister called the next morning and reported that he sounded terrible. He was strugging to breathe and was SOB. His sister went over to his house to check on him and wanted to take him to the doctor&#39;s office or the hospital. Pt refused at that time. Pt agreed to make a doctor appointment for later in the afternoon. Sister left at noon. She stated her brother had made a doctor appointment for 4:00 at Family Practice. Upon arriving, pt started walking towards the entrance and became SOB. His significant other asked the doctor&#39;s office for a  wheelchair and was denied. Pt coded in parking lot of Doctor&#39;s Office and passed away at 4:31 p.m.

A 66-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL1284) at arm, left upper, via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 06:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) formally diagnosed around Jan2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported he got the COVID-19 Vaccine at 06:15 on 29Dec2020 and had to sit for 15 minutes afterwards before he could leave. He said everything was fine, and he walked out to the hospital lobby, and was speaking with a work associate for 10 minutes before he headed to his car. When he got ready to leave, he got in his car, and started his car. He started driving home, and realized he was in AFIB. He did have an AFIB issue. His AFIB has been pretty well controlled for a year now, as long as, he didn&#39;t do something stupid. He had a moderately aggressive run of AFIB. He said his &#34;smart&#34; watch told him his heart rate was 117. His normal heart rate is around 60-70. He was in AFIB for about 3 hours. His typical runs of AFIB are considerably shorter. He only had a total of 2 episodes of AFIB in the last year. His prior AFIB episodes would have been about 4-5 minutes. The last time he had AFIB that lasted any length of time was when he was hospitalized for AFIB around Jan2020. He said at that time, he was hospitalized overnight for observation. He received medication during the hospitalization and his AFIB broke. He didn&#39;t remember what medications were given to him during the hospitalization. He said he had flutters before that hospitalization, but the flutters were always gone after a few minutes, so he never sought treatment because there would be nothing to treat. The patient reported he noticed the rest of the day on 29Dec2020, right up to going to bed that he felt cold. His house wasn&#39;t cold, and he didn&#39;t have a fever. He said the cold feeling went away during the night while he was sleeping. He said the cold feeling easily lasted for a 12 hours. He said the cold feeling could have been something else. The outcome of &#34;he was in afib for about 3 hours after receiving his first dose of the covid19 vaccine&#34; was recovered on 29Dec2020; of &#34;he noticed the rest of the day, right up to going to bed that he felt cold&#34; was recovered on 30Dec2020.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after injection, I was awakened with heart pounding in my chest and it felt fast but I did not check it. Watch did not show higher than 84 through the night but I could not sleep much due to the heart pounding. Arose for work at 6:15 and felt tired but the palpitations did not bother while standing. Temperature 98.8. about 90 minutes later, while at work, HR was 130-148, I was breathing deeply, otherwise okay. Chills started about 17 hours post-injection and temperature rose as high as 102.4 in the next 3 hours. HR lowered to about 110 about 16 hours post injection and did not get below 100 for another 12 hours. some coughing throughout this time, not productive. Heavy night sweats around 34 hours post injection. I had mild chills about 48 hours post injection, and fine since then. The palpitations were very uncomfortable but stopped once the HR lowered to about 110

At 8pm, my heart was racing very fast and took blood pressure,  It was very high, 152/105 pulse 74.  I called 24hr nurse on call.  She said call 911. Ambulance was on site within 5 minute and transported me to hospital.  I was in the ER at least 6 hours, moderating my heart.  They said I had an A FIB attack.  They got it down and admitted me to the hospital.  I also experienced pain in my bladder, I could not urinate.  They had to drain it 2 times.  I was released from the hospital at 8pm the next day.  Any questions, don&#39;t hesitate to ask me or my doctor.

                                                12/21/2020 I had my first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and the second on 1/13/2021. Two days after my second vaccine on 1/15/2021 at 8:50 PM I had a scintillating scotoma in my right visual field in both eyes consisting of a bright flash of light in the center of my visual field that cleared but then it expanded into a C-shaped series of zig-zag lines that slowly expanded into the periphery of both right visual fields. It ended at 9:20 PM. I had no headaches afterward. While I have had migraines when I was younger, I haven?t had one in several decades and I never had an aura before it.   I went to the ED where I was evaluated for a possible TIA and then admitted into Hospital. While there my platelet count was 400% of what it usually was.  Other than the platelet count and anemia (I donated 2 unit of packed red blood cells on 12/17/2020) the rest of my blood work was unrevealing.   The scintilating scotoma only lasted 30 minutes but the elevated platelets (although slowly coming down) continues to this day.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

                                                My husband had fever of 102.6 the morning after he received the vaccine. He continued to run high fever. He had gi symptoms with diarrhea. He was up all Saturday night with generalized body aching  and diarrhea. On Sunday night he coded in the bathroom at home. CPR was started when EMS arrived he was in full cardiac arrest. He was coded for 1 hour without any return of heart function. I found my husband on the bathroom floor on that Sunday night about 1140pm performed CPR and activated 911.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 02Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. There were no concomitant medications nor medical history. He did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. No history of any other vaccines or events. He got his vaccine on Saturday(02Jan2021) at 1:30pm(13:30) and by 5:30pm(17:30) had very sore arms/arm pain, at 7:30pm(19:30) he had chills off and on and was sweating. He woke up soaking wet and did that on Sunday, but was feeling a little better today. He also experienced body aches and fever in Jan2021. Today is testing day at his work and he tested positive for COVID virus on 05Jan2021. Not sure if it&#39;s a coincidence. Again, he got the shot and then started having all these symptoms at 5:30 and 7:30. Now they are both on quarantine for the 10-14 days. He wanted to see if it&#39;s possible to test positive for the virus after getting the shot or is it just a coincidence. He also had some muscle aches in Jan2021. Last night (04Jan2021), he woke up again sweating, but not like on Saturday, but he got really warm and started to sweat a little, and on Sunday(03Jan2021) he was cold all day and had a tiny cough, but it wasn&#39;t significant. Ever so often she would hear him cough. All of a sudden patient would wake up sweating. Again, Saturday he soaked everything. There was no Emergency Room nor Physician Office. Outcome of Very sore arms, sweating was recovering, of pain and fever was unknown, of other events was not recovered.    Information on Lot/Batch has been requested.

A 67-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 20Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (A-fib), cryotherapy (cryoablation), blood pressure abnormal, and anticoagulant therapy (blood thinner). The patient was vaccinated at a clinic. Concomitant medications included metoprolol succinate, quinapril for blood pressure, dabigatran etexilate mesilate (PRADAXA), hydrochlorothiazide, zinc, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]), and krill oil. The patient previously took flu shot (INFLUENZA) in Nov2020 two months ago, and shingles shot (SHINGRIX) years ago and experienced sore arm. The patient reported having no problem until 18:30 when he felt an &#34;increased heart rate to the point where he could hear it&#34;. He pursued saying he read his &#34;oxygen level at 95&#34; and &#34;pulse at 121&#34; with a pulse oximeter, and took his blood pressure, which was at 161/91 wilt a pulse between 128-130. He mentioned therefore going to bed and laid down, and his &#34;oxygen level was at 85&#34; and &#34;pulse at 136&#34; still using his pulse oximeter. He specified that his wife verified the pulse oximeter and after a delayed that felt like 5 minutes, she took his &#34;oxygen level and pulse&#34; which were at 95 and 72 respectively. He stated that &#34;all lasted 30 minutes&#34;. As per source, &#34;Received first COVID-19 Vaccine. Sat for 15 minutes and didn&#39;t have any problems. Last night around 6:30PM noticed a heart rate increase rapidly to the point where he could almost hear or feel it. Pulse oximeter showed pulse was 121 and an oxygen level of 94. Talked to his wife and sat down. Took blood pressure and it was 161/91. Put on pulse oximeter. Oxygen level was dropping to mid-eighties and pulse was between 135- 136. Laid down for 10-15minutes. Tried again and his oxygen level was back to 95 and pulse was 72. Whole episode lasted about 30 minutes. Was reading paperwork and talked about rapid heart rate. Had Afib, takes medication for it and had a cryoablation about eight years ago. Feels fine today. Has not had any more episodes like that and wanted to report it. Wants to know if he should contact his doctor. Wondering will he expect this again with the second dose. Could it happen again and is there anything he can do as a safety guard? Stated he could almost hear his heart beating and was checking his pulse on his neck. His heart rate returned to 71, which is low for him. Usually his heart rate is high seventies or low eighties.&#34; Clinical outcome of the events was recovered on 20Jan2021.

Patient received the covid19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 2/9/2021, vaccine was administered without complications. No prior positive for covid19. After patient received his covid19 vaccine, he was seen at same day access for increased SOB/DOE, worsened orthopnea. Per progress notes, at this last appt, patient had expressed a number of medications which he was not willing to take, attributing his worsened health to their effects. Pt has continued spironolactone despite being advised to stop it by his medical provider. At the time of visit, provider noted that this kidney function was declining (patient does have CKD). Provider discussed the importance of medication adherence and patient was started on torsemide. Hctz was discontinued, minoxidil was increased due to patient preference. Prior to this same day access/express care visit, patient was hospitalized from 1/26 through 1/28/2021 for hypertensive urgency (211/105) and that at that time, pt already had orthopnea, SOB, and dyspnea. Patient was also admitted from 1/7 to 1/8 and left AMA. While inpatient, his MRI revealed a pontine lacunar infarct that was found to be chronic. It was recommended that patient be treated with aspirin/plavix for 21 days then aspirin alone but patient declined.

                                                Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness; Almost passed out; Very light headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm (shoulder), on 26Jan2021 at 12:00, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, acid reflux, and multivitamin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, esomeprazole for acid reflux, and ascorbic acid/ biotin/ boron/ calcium/ calcium pantothenate/ chloride/ chromium/ colecalciferol/ copper/ cyanocobalamin/ folic acid/ iodine/ lycopene/ magnesium/ manganese/ molybdenum/ nickel/ nicotinamide/ phosphorus/ phytomenadione/ potassium/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol acetate/ riboflavin/ selenium/ silicon dioxide/ sodium metavanadate/ thiamine mononitrate/ tocopheryl acetate/ xantofyl/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER ADULTS 50&#43;) as multivitamin, all were ongoing; omeprazole for acid reflux; and an unspecified multivitamin.  The patient really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. The patient has been administered both first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. The patient had been having some strange things that he didn&#39;t know if its COVID-19 shot related but they&#39;re symptoms he never had before. About 8 to 11 days after first dose of the vaccine (Feb2021; maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021), the patient had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out or almost fainted. The patient clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8 to 11 days. Also, in Feb2021, the patient had almost a very light headache where he almost fainted. The patient went to the emergency room in Feb2021 and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00 to 18:00 the following day. The patient spent the night in hospital, they sent him the next day. While in hospital (Feb2021), the patient had electrocardiograms (EKGs) of his head (as reported), magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of his head, computed tomography (CTs; CT scan with contrast) of his head, and echocardiograms of his heart (microcardiogram). All of those tests came back normal (okay), nothing abnormal on results. They were relating this to a stroke-like symptom; however, the results were normal, also his blood test results were fine. The patient had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3 to 4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. The patient was not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because the event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit. Because of the first episode, the patient then went to his family doctor and the doctor ordered some other testing done. The patient was scheduled to get a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test (stress test of heart), his results on 10Mar2021 came back normal (not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine). The patient believed that the results of those tests both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. The patient was continuing to have some lightheaded episodes or symptoms just about daily but nothing really; continued to have symptoms which was not normal for him. Sometimes, they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes, the patient had a good day, but he had those lightheaded episodes and he never had it before he got the shot. As therapeutic measures in the hospital, the emergency room gave the patient something for dizziness when he was there, but he was no longer taking it. Currently, the patient was really taking nothing. The patient had also gone to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor where he had a balance test or a videonystagmography (VNG) test done on 17Mar2021. The patient will get results of balance test on Wednesday (24Mar2021). Every year (unspecified), the patient goes and get his yearly test in which they had his blood work done and this and his glucose levels were always good, cholesterol level was always good. All the patient&#39;s other tests come back as normal on an unspecified date. The patient had never had these symptoms before, he hasn&#39;t changed his medications or habits and it&#39;s odd that this happened 9 to 10 days after both doses of the vaccine. The patient would like to know if this has been reported before as a side effect related to the vaccine. The patient was not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. Also, he does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can&#39;t figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines. So the patient doesn&#39;t know if anybody else is reporting this but he had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them around days after each shot and he was continuing to have lightheaded episodes but not severe as those 2 but he had lightheaded (dizzy) episodes daily, since the COVID-19 vaccine. But they didn&#39;t know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the COVID-19 shot. And he never had anything like that, and he was not blaming it on the COVID-10 shot. That was the only thing changed in his lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that&#39;s the only thing changed, his medication has not changed, and diet doesn&#39;t change. Nothing has changed other than the patient got COVID-19 shots. The patient wanted to report it, so the company had a report file and other people reporting it. The patient wanted to know if the company was having any other report or something like this so that he would know if it might be related to the shot. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

My mother contacted Pfizer who instructed us to alternate Tylenol and Motrin. Tylenol given and Motrin given 4 hours later as instructed by Pfizer. On 3/30/21 around 11:10am my dad was found unresponsive, not breathing and did not have a pulse. My mother immediately called 911 and my aunt began CPR. When EMS arrived he was found to be in cardiac arrest and after 25 min of efforts by EMS my father passed away less than 24 hours after receiving his 2nd covid vaccine.

A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), intramuscular in the left arm on 19Jan2021 (at 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   Medical history included blood cholesterol of 200 (not further specified).  The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included irbesartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 19Jan2020 at 08:00, after the vaccine, that patient was at work and was feeling unwell and the patient was found by his secretary unconscious. An ambulance was called. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was 79/38 and electrocardiogram showed acute myocardial infarction. He underwent one stent placement with the remaining arteries normal. He was also started on ticagrelor (BRILINTA), metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and atorvastatin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient immediately improved and was feeling well and resumed exercise. The clinical outcomes of the unconscious, acute myocardial infarction, and feeling unwell were recovering. The events required emergency room visit and were assessed as serious for requiring hospitalization for 2 days and being life-threatening.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that reported events acute myocardial infarction, unconsciousness and feeling unwell are related to BNT162B2.  The events are more likely intercurrent medical condition for this elderly patient.

They had dinner at 5 pm and at 6pm they were sitting on the couch and all of sudden he started slurring his words and he said his mouth felt like someone give him Novocain and then he had his arm around her and all of sudden it felt like he was choking her so she grabbed his hand and his fingers started rolling up, started closing up tight so she started playing with his fingers and then he went out in the kitchen and then he hit the floor and she called # and the paramedics came up there. When they got there he could squeeze both hands and lift both feet by that time it was 7:30, they had just brought in a chair, by time they got done bringing in the chair they realized his left side was becoming paralyzed and so they had to go back and get the stretcher so they were there for about 30 minutes, maybe 15 minutes then they headed up the hill toward the hospital at about 8pm and they came in and gave anti-blood clotting medicine and took him for a scan with dye, they found he still had a blockage on his brain so at 2AM on the 9th they came in with a medical helicopter and flew him to (institution name withheld) in (place name withheld) and they did an MRI on and seen his carotid blockage there so he had emergency surgery at from # that morning of the 09Jan2021 at (institution name withheld) and he was in ICU from Saturday until a week ago at 3 oclock 13Jan2021 he was placed in a regular room and on the 19Jan2021 at 7:30PM he was moved (hospital name) in (place name withheld) for 14 days having 15 hours per day of therapy for a week and then he will go to (place name withheld) (rehab name withheld) and he could be there 2-3 weeks.

He doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the vaccine but wants to know where the shortness of breath is coming from, if it is a side effect. The vaccine was administered on 19Jan2021. He has been very inactive and is waiting for back surgery that has been put off due COVID, the hospital delayed the surgery. He is very likely diabetic and takes one pill a day for this. He also has high blood pressure but is controlled and normal range is 120/70. It was elevated along with his heart rate (on Jan2021) with the bad breathing or shortness of breath episodes. He is trying to get surgical clearance and so he had an echocardiogram the Monday before the vaccine was given and a stress test on the Thursday prior to that. It was given in the upper left arm, he also has a little bruise that is still there now (Jan2021). It was given about 3:30pm. No treatment received. Event outcome of shortness of breath was not recovered, of others was unknown.

My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

Patient with complicated medical history including stage 1B pancreatic cancer (was currently on chemotherapy mFOLFIRINOX), and a leadless permanent pacemaker implantation on 1-11-21 for long episodes of SR with complete heart block following symptoms of syncope (other cardiac history: CAD s/p CABG 2009, PAF, and HTN). Regarding ER visit for epigastric pain, nothing notable was found on workup and patient was to discharge home to rest. There were available doses of COVID-19 Vaccine following a vaccine clinic that same day, and patient was offered and agreed to a dose of vaccine. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes post vaccine with no notable issues. The following day, Monday 1-18-21, patient&#39;s caregiver called facility at 22:30 to report he had a fever of 102.8 degrees and that he had been &#34;feeling kind of bad all day&#34;. Patient was advise to seek urgent medical care and reported back to ED on 1-19-21 at 00:55. Patient wasd admitted for SIRS (tachycardia and febrile) -- patient also reported diffuse myalgia. WBC WNL, CXR unremarkable for infection, UA neg for bacteria, LFTs WNL, blood cultures negative. Procalcitonin elevated at 17.8 -- suggesting inflammatory response. Patient initially reported feeling better on the morning of 1-19-21, but around 13:00 began rapidly declining (confusion, unable to walk) and started experiencing EKG changes (9 beats of SVT). Patient then coded and resuscitation was attempted for approximately 30 minutes. Patient did not survive the code. Coroner has been notified and family is considering autopsy at time of this report.

                                                when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain; feel a little tightness in his breathing/ tightness/shortness of breath; on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%; feel a little bit of heat on his forehead; nose dripping/nose was running; seems like it isn&#39;t working; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine &#34;seems like it isn&#39;t working&#34;. The patient stated it doesn&#39;t look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor&#39;s arms are so sore and &#39;blah blah&#39; and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn&#39;t feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn&#39;t know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven&#39;t been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn&#39;t normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn&#39;t immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn&#39;t been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and &#39;on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%&#39; was recovering, &#39;when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain&#39; was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

                                                Stroke; Dose Number 1 on 08Jan2021/Dose Number 2 on 25Jan2021; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient has no medical history. Concomitant medication included tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX). Patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) intramuscular on 08Jan2021 on the left arm. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at the hospital. On 18Jan2021 06:00, the patient experienced right foot drop. Spine MRI on 18Jan2021 was negative. Stroke confirmed on brain MRI on 28Jan2021. Patient was sent to the ED at the hospital immediately after and was admitted from the ED to the hospital. Number of days of hospitalization was 2. Adverse event result: doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Patient has not recovered from the event stroke. Event was reported as non-serious. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient has been tested for COVID-19 with test type: nasal swab on 28Jan2021 with result negative. Patient has no known allergies. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the event stroke mostly represented intercurrent condition in this patient with advanced age, unrelated to Bnt162b2. Relevant medical history and concurrent disease are missing for a medically meaningful assessment.

Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus; Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; COVID-19 confirmed by positive COVID-19 test / COVID pneumonia; blood clot; blood pressure was low; Respiratory arrest; Respiratory failure; Hypoxemia; ventricular tachycardia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting on behalf of the husband. A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

                                                Patient expired. Per Emergency MD note: &#34;This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.&#34;

He suddenly did not know where is was, how he got there, or why he was there. He continuously asked those questions throughout the balance of the day. The nurses on duty in the clinic got a wheel chair and escorted us to the  hospital ER in the same building. He was immediately taken to a room where a doctor met us and began asking him questions. The Dr quickly ordered a multitude of tests. Results shown in item 19

A 72-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number unknown and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (EL8982) on 19Jan2021. The reporter (wife) stated that she and her husband both took the Covid vaccine. The patient (husband) is the one who have the adverse reactions. On 19Jan2021, she and her husband had the first shot, the Pfizer Covid shot. On 10Feb2021, they had the second shot. Just today she picked her husband from the hospital, they dismissed him for today because on 18Feb2021, she had to take him to emergency room because he had pulmonary embolism. He has multiple clots in his lungs. This is nothing that they dealt before with him. The reporter is afraid that it might be related to have taken the vaccine. Reporter stated that when she took him to the emergency room, it was 18Feb2021. Now he had a little shortness of breath for few days before the 18th but they didn&#39;t realize that he was having a big problem. He fully developed this on 18Feb2021. The reason for hospitalization was pulmonary embolism and blood clots in his lungs. He is little bit slow like the reporter said she got him to the hospital where he stayed 3 days she guess with pulmonary embolism, from 18Feb2021 to 21Feb2021. He had lot a of lab work while he was in hospital on these days the wife described. He had blood work, Echocardiogram, CAT scan, Ultrasounds, Chest X-ray, Covid rapid test, they haven&#39;t got back the result yet. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                terrible terrible stomach pain; bug in his colon; white blood cell 18000/19500; his blood pressure was out of the roof; could not eat anymore; he&#39;s lost 10 pounds; dehydrated; vomiting 5 times; nausea; feeling warm; broke out in sweats; arm was sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). This consumer reported similar event for 3 patients (for herself, her husband and their doctor). This is 1st of three reports (husband case) and only this case is serious. A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure abnormal; both from 2007 and ongoing; about 13-14 years, he does not take insulin, he takes oral medication. The consumer is calling for her husband who is in the hospital. His symptoms started after Covid 19 injection. He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

                                                High pulse rate; Blood pressure low; Sweating; Clammy; wasn&#39;t feeling well; Chills; feeling feverish without having a fever; Fatigue/Tiredness; irregular heartbeat; he said the nausea started later on Friday evening; he had a sore right arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; He said he already has stomach trouble; pain in his chest.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included heart rate irregular and blood pressure high. Concomitant medications were none. The patient said he had an irregular heartbeat after getting his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021. He said he had to go to the Emergency Room on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He clarified he checked his blood pressure at home and his blood pressure was low at 91/73. He said he also had a high pulse rate of 160, or better, for 9-1/2 hours. He said the only thing he can attribute his low blood pressure and high pulse rate to is the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he hasn&#39;t heard anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine being related to having an effect on the heart, but he personally believes it was his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose that caused his low blood pressure and high pulse rate. He clarified after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021, he had a sore right arm after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, fatigue, tiredness, and nausea. He said on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he recognized a small amount of chills, feeling feverish without having a fever, and sweating. He said his wife checked his temperature a few times on Saturday, 30Jan2021, and he never had a fever, but he felt clammy. He said he had noticed the nausea more than anything else. He said he maybe should have checked his blood pressure on Saturday, 30Jan2021. He said he didn&#39;t check his blood pressure until Sunday morning, 31Jan2021, and when he saw his low blood pressure and high pulse rate, he called the hospital and eventually drove to the Emergency Room. He said by the time he had got to the Emergency Room his blood pressure had went up to &#34;100 and something&#34;, but his pulse rate never changed, and his pulse was still 160. He said the doctor gave him several medications to try to get his pulse rate to come down. He said the doctor had given him a medication that was supposed to bring his pulse down. He said then the doctor had to add something else in a syringe to go with the other medication to bring his pulse down. He said he wasn&#39;t sure of the medication&#39;s name. He clarified he never noticed his pulse rate was high until he took his blood pressure on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he felt the nausea start later Friday evening (29Jan2021). He said he already has stomach trouble anyways that he takes medicine for, so he took a pill, but the nausea continued. He clarified he took 1 Omeprazole 20mg capsule that was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, but stated the Omeprazole 20mg prescription looked like it expired in 2017. He said he knows he has a newer Omeprazole prescription, but did not know where the prescription bottle was. He reported on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he just laid around. He said he did not feel as bad on Saturday, as he did on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he called the Emergency Room on Sunday morning, and went to the Emergency Room. He said he didn&#39;t feel his 160 pulse rate. He said he was told by the doctor in the Emergency Room that his fast heart rate had his heart beating like he was having a stress test. He reported he doesn&#39;t know if he wants to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot after what he experienced this past weekend. He reported he only takes blood pressure medicine that he has  been on for a while. He reported he had several EKGs done on Sunday, 31Jan2021, while he was in the Emergency Room. He said the EKG showed Atrial Fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 160s. He reported while he was in the Emergency Room he was given IV Heparin, IV Potassium, Potassium pills, and Amiodarone in a pill and IV form. He said the doctor added another IV medicine in a syringe, but he doesn&#39;t know the name of the medicine. He said the doctor also gave him IV Morphine because he had pain in his chest. He said the doctor said his chest pain was being caused by his heart trying to go back into a regular rhythm.  He reported he was in the Emergency Room for 11-12 hours before he was admitted to the hospital. He said his pulse rate wasn&#39;t coming down and stayed at 160 for 9-1/2 hours. He said the doctor wanted to admit him to the hospital, so he could have a procedure to make sure the high pulse rate didn&#39;t damage his heart. He said on Monday, 01Feb2021, he had a procedure where they went through his wrist and put a dye in his heart to see if the stress from his high pulse rate damaged his heart. He said his heart wasn&#39;t damaged, so he was discharged from the hospital later in the day on 01Feb2021. He clarified his blood pressure was good by the time the first or second EKG was performed in the Emergency Room. He clarified he already had an issue with sweating before he received his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he is still sweating, but he doesn&#39;t know if that is because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical outcome of high pulse rate and blood pressure low was recovered on 31Jan2021; nausea, fatigue/tiredness recovered on 02Feb2021; chills, feeling feverish recovered on an unspecified date; sweating was not recovered; while for the other events was unknown.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

                                                blacked out; scraped his face; light headaches; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 17Feb2021 03:00 (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2008 and ongoing and reported that it&#39;s under control. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient was calling because he got his shot through the (facility name withheld) on the 17Feb2021 around 3:00. The caller goes for walks, and one week later he had a blackout, about the same time he got the shot 3:00 or 3:15 on 24Feb2021. The caller blacked out and he broke his glasses, scraped his face, all that stuff. All the scrapes were healing. The weirdest thing was it happened almost exactly a week later. The caller asked was it possible that this could be related to the vaccine. For the following two days after the vaccine the caller had 2 light headaches on 18Feb2021 and then they were gone on 19Feb2021. This blackout event happened one time. Caller mentioned the headaches were nothing to be concerned about. The caller was not given a vaccination card at the (facility name withheld) and does not know the lot number, NDC number, or expiration date. This was the caller&#39;s first dose of the vaccine. The caller mentioned that 11Mar2021 was his next appointment for the second dose of the vaccine. The caller has never had a black out episode or dizziness before. The caller said he licked his wounds and will be okay. No visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office required. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No relevant tests done. The outcome was recovered on 19Feb2021 for the event Headache; and recovering for the other events.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Dec2020 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He was an ER doctor and the medical director of his hospital. The patient was asymptomatic when he got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. 3 hours after the vaccine he began to get chills, HA, anorexia, myalgias, and extreme fatigue. This worsened and he slept all and had no appetite. On 19Dec2020 he woke up delirious with a fever and was ataxic, hypoxic, incontinent, and confused. The patient was hospitalized due to the events on 15Dec2020. The events also caused prolonged hospitalization due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab post vaccination with unknown results. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as the patient required oxygen, plasma, and remdisivir.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, BNT162B2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of reported serious events might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  Fever, chills, headache, fatigue and muscle pain are the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  More information such as detailed underlying medical conditions and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Never had a fever. All of a sudden, around 2:30PM all dissipated, it was all gone and I was fine. A week later I called my PCP because the symptoms came back - the lethargy. He suggested me to go to the ER. I went and could barely write my name on the sign in sheet at the hospital. They did 5 COVID tests and 4 of them were negative. I was at the ER for 3 days and finally was admitted and stayed for 11 days.  I was sent home with oxygen and my levels are finally getting back to 92/93.  I can&#39;t walk at this time.

Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction.

The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office.

Developed pain in my abdomen area quite noticeable 4 days later.  6 days later had major pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea.  Went to ER morning of the 7th day....spent 4 days in hospital.  Had a blood clot--Portal Vein Thrombosis.  Put on Heparin drip in hospital...and Eliquis blood thinners after released.  I have never been sick like that...never been on any prescription...always been healthy, walking 3-5 miles per day.   My family feels that there must be a connection with the vaccine.  One of my doctors said no...another said didn&#39;t think so, but unknown at this time.

                                                My father complained of heartburn the evening he received his vaccine.  He told my mother he need to sit  down and relax.  My mother walked into the other room to watch some TV while she allowed my dad to relax.  During that time, my mother fell asleep.  She woke up after an hour when she realized my dad was not sitting next to her.  She went to the living room where he was sitting and discovered he was not breathing and passed away.  EMT was called and they said they could not do anything for my dad since he was already gone.

I then got a cold compress and had him lay back with feet up and put cold compress on his nose and a small ice bag on his forehead and for a little bit when I took the tissue from left nostril that is where the blood was coming form and i saw that there was clotted blood.  After changing the cold compress on his head the nosebleed began to subside and he continue to sit with his head back but when he sat up after about a half hour it started to bleed again out of the left nostril and that is what he has began experiencing. whenever he sits up it begins again it begins but no clotted blood.

                                                I had sudden malaise, lost consciousness and my wife says was not breathing briefly. I revived and was taken to the hospital, and treated for 2 1/2 days with heart catheterization and TPA injected into my clot in the pulmonary arteries with good resolution. I did have cor pulmonale with acute severe right heart failure as part of that, Dr. thought the clot came from my right calf by his examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by CAT scan cardiac Echo and right heart catheterization.
