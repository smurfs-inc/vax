                                                On Saturday 2/6/21 in the morning on the left side under  armpit felt like he had a pulled muscle or something. It eventually radiated over up into the left quadrant of his chest where he could not push down on it.  It was extremely painful by Monday.  He has a history of esophageal spasms and exacerbated them to where he thought he was having a heart attack.  He called his Cardiologist and told him to go to the ER.  He went to the hospital Monday evening, he had two EKG&#39;s, had blood drawn 3 times, did sonograms looking for blood clots.  He did inform them that he had the vaccine on Friday and they told him it was due to that.  He went to nuclear medicine to get his lung checked for blood clots as well.  All tests were negative.  He saw his PCP today who told him that the lymph nodes were affected due to the vaccine.  He has improved greatly, still has some slight discomfort which his PCP said would go away in time.

A 76-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3248, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 11:00 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation (reported he has had no occurrence for 3-4 years); and high blood pressure and high cholesterol, both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing; and pneumonia. Concomitant medications included that patient was also taking high blood pressure medication and high cholesterol medication. When asking for the Lot number, reporter explained &#34;his card was in his wallet but she gave her lot and said it was the same, they got the shot at the same time, within 5 minutes of each other&#34;. Patient previously took amoxicillin for pneumonia from 09Jan2021 to 13Jan2021, reported as he took this for 5 days and stopped.  This was reported as &#34;It was noted that he had pneumonia and got an antibiotic that he took for 5 days. It was amoxicillin and was started on 09Jan2021&#34; (pending clarification). Reporter also stated that she was not sure if it was a Pfizer vaccine but patient did have a mild reaction to the first shingles vaccine (unspecified) but this lasted only 24 hours. Reporter, a wife calling for her husband (patient), was reporting on the COVID vaccine and who explained he was having symptoms and wanted to report this but also has a question on what to do. Patient was extremely tired. This was noticed on the 3rd day after the shot. This would be Friday 05Feb2021 and it was the same since starting. There were moments when he has rested and showered where he felt better but then it went down again. The patient had muscle pain, aches on 05Feb2021, this would be Friday, and it came and went but was about the same. Patient had extreme chills on 05Feb2021, and he was still shaking now (05Feb2021). It was a little better during the day, maybe because he was moving around but last night he was shivering and shaking for 3 hours and she could not get him warm even with the heating pad. Patient also had joint pain on 05Feb2021 and it was the same since starting. Patient had fever that probably started Sunday, 07Feb2021 wherein few hours ago, it was 102.00 but she got it down to about 100.2 now, it has increased and was the reason she called today. Patient&#39;s belly was swollen since 05Feb2021 and it was the same since starting. She remarked she was not sure if this was where lymph nodes were or not and the cause of the swelling. It was also explained that due to hurting, it was hard for him to breath. When he moved and exerted, his breathing was labored. This would be Friday, 05Feb2021 and it is the same since starting. Yesterday, patient went to his primary doctor. He was supposed to do blood work but couldn&#39;t due to his fever. The doctor prescribed him an anti-inflammatory called Etodolac 500mg. It was by Taro Pharmacutal US (there was no Lot or expiry). He took one at 7pm and was to take them twice a day, took another a little while ago.

A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient woke up and had  severe acid reflux, trouble breathing for about 15 minutes, couldn&#39;t catch his breath, was wheezing and sounded like an asthma attack.  He felt like something was stuck in his throat. It cleared in 10 seconds and he could breathe and swallow fine.  He took a Benadryl as treatment and drank water.  He also felt tired. The patient further reported that he had the covid vaccine shot. He did not know if he was having a reaction, but he was taking a nap, and he guessed he regurgitated. He had a difficult time catching his breath, it was like it was stuck in the throat. He vomited lying down. He felt the stomach acid come up into mouth after he was able to breath better. But before he was not breathing at all. This never happened before. He was lying flat, he guessed he threw up. He had a large lunch, maybe too large. It was like he was getting something caught in in throat. The patient also reported that his throat was burning and mentioned that he slept on a triangular pillow. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

EKG in the emergency room showed STEMI and troponin levels were normal. He was transferred to a different facility for cardiac catheterization. Cath showed mild circumflex disease and a stent was placed. He was diagnosed with pericarditis at that time (elevated inflammatory markers ESR/CRP). He was discharged home post cath on Plavix/ASA.   He had an echocardiogram at his PCP?s office on 2/25, results still pending (as of 3/10).  2/25 ? televist with cardiologist who concurred with pericarditis, maybe mild coronary artery disease (follow-up scheduled 3/11).  3/3 chest pain symptom improved further, no cough, improved shortness of breath.      Medications at home: statin, previously colchine for gout, likely BP medication (PCP will send records)  Allergies: None known.  Vaccine Indication: Age &gt;75

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6202 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and stage 4 kidney disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Feb2021 (Saturday), patient was not feeling well and on 28Feb2021, he had diarrhea, chills, shaking all over, severe headache and started throwing up. Reporter stated patient had all the symptoms of the reactions and then &#34;you go again to the serious, more dangerous symptoms, he has all of them&#34;. Throwing up, fever, chills, diarrhea and then he get real hot and then he started sweating and it was another day on 01Mar2021. On Monday (01Mar2021), reporter called to take patient to the hospital with high fever. The ambulance put him on IV and oxygen right away. They gave him fluids and were monitoring everything because he was dehydrated and then he stayed in the hospital for some time. He had x-rays, they monitored his blood pressure and heart rate, and the doctor was concerned about his heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor decided to check his urine and he did and he had a UTI on 01Mar2021, and so he gave him antibiotics for that (treatment unspecified). Patient seemed to be better after having the fluids and everything so they let him come home. During the night on 01Mar2021, he had another attack and it was the same thing that he had before. The shaking and the chills the fever and throwing up and the doctor said that it was a reaction from having the vaccination and reporter just wanted to report that he did and reported actually thought he was going to die. Reporter tried to call again the ambulance since she thought that he was not going to make it. The doctor put on the report and he did not put on there that he was in there because of suspected of (incomplete sentence) and then told the reporter himself that he had a reaction from the vaccine. The report stated that patient was in for a UT, but the reporter stated that, once does not call an ambulance for a UTI and she (reporter), have UTI&#39;s all the time. After the reporter got the patient home, he was even much worse. Patient could not breathe and he was struggling to breathe on 01Mar2021. He was shivering, shaking, having diarrhea, throwing up, soaking wet, and she had to change his clothes twice, and his fever was 103.1 F around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning of 02Mar2021. The pharmacist gave medicine for vomiting. Reporter called the hospital and the nurses were busy and they could not take it so 24 hour nurse called. She was finally able to get him comfortable enough that she didn&#39;t have to call again. She thought she was going lose him. She said she felt twice he was going to die, when she called. At the hospital they told him he was having a severe reaction to the vaccine but also had a UTI and they gave him antibiotics. Patient contacted her nephew who is a medic in the military and RN and he said patient has Covid and thinks reporter has Covid too because the virus was in the vaccine. The nephew explained that patient just could not fight it off and said the vaccine acts like that. It made sense because it is inhibit in it then your body will learn to fight it off, like if you come in contact with it and that makes sense but the woman never explained. The nephew further stated to reported that patient&#39;s immune system or whatever was not able to fight it off. So, he said he has to have Covid and when patient heard that after all they had fought to stay away from it and then what were they supposed to do. Patient got the vaccine and ended up with it and that is what reporter have found out and it was very disturbing. Patient was running a 103.1 earlier on the night of 02Mar2021. He was moaning a little bit on Mar2021. Reporter thought patient had severe allergic reaction to the vaccine because he had all the symptoms and stated there was no doubt in her mind (referring to it being an allergic reaction) as it was too soon after the vaccine. Outcome of the event of dehydration was recovering, while for the remaining events was unknown. Reporter was asking if patient should take the second shot.

This 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EK5730), via an unknown route, on 17Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 78-year-old. The patient was diabetic and hypertensive. Additional medical history included hyperlipidaemia. No relevant concomitant medications were provided. On 18Dec2020, the patient developed severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body. On 19Dec2020, the patient developed achy. On 20Dec2020, the patient was dehydrated and hypotensive, he had also chills.  On unknown date, blood pressure was down to 76/50. His symptoms for COVID were severe achy cramps, hypotension, and dehydration. On 20Dec2020, COVID-19 test was positive. On 21Dec2020, the patient was given monoclonal antibodies.  A computerized tomogram (CT) of the lungs was performed on 21Dec2020 and it was ok. A week later (Dec2020), he had a repeat CT which showed increased infiltrates of 10 to 15%. He then started on dexamethasone, apixaban (ELIQUIS) and the rest of the things. He had a repeat CT on 05Jan2021 which showed resolution of the infiltrates; most of the lesions went gone. CT results had improved significantly. The patient underwent a second COVID test a week ago which was still positive. He had a third COVID on 06Jan2021, but results were not available yet. The patient queried if he can proceed with second dose planned on 07Jan2021 or if he should wait. The clinical outcome was recovered for the event &#39;severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body&#39; on 19Dec2020, for &#39;dehydration/dehydrated&#39; on 20Dec2020, for &#39;chills&#39; on unknown date in Dec2020, for &#39;achy&#39; on 30Dec2020, for &#39;hypotensive&#39; on 20Dec2020; the outcome of the event &#39;CT showed increased infiltrates 10-15%&#39; was recovering; the outcome for &#39;Tested positive for COVID-19&#39; was unknown.  The reporter considered the events &#39;achy&#39; and &#39;severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body&#39; serious because causing disability; the events &#39;tested positive for COVID-19&#39;, &#39;dehydration/dehydrated&#39;, &#39;chills&#39; and &#39;hypotensive&#39; were considered medically significant.  The reporter considered the events &#39;Tested positive for COVID-19&#39;, &#39;CT showed increased infiltrates 10-15%&#39; and &#39;dehydrated/dehydration&#39; unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

                                                Lightheadedness; Headache; tightness in his chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EK4176, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm/ shoulder area on 15Jan2021 at 11:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, patient has epilepsy that has been controlled since 1977; and issues with his blood pressure. He has no allergies. Concomitant medications included phenobarbital and phenytoin (DILANTIN), both for epilepsy. He takes HTZ TRI something, it is a long word but is basically 2 diuretic. He is also being followed by a cardiologist. Patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient got the COVID injection 2.5 hours ago on 15Jan2021 and after that he had a slight case of lightheadedness. He was instructed to drink water and walk if he was able, he did that and it helped. The patient relays that he was fasting that morning and thinks that had some degree of relatedness in the lightheaded feeling. He ate lunch and the light headedness resolved but now he has a slight headache. He was reading the paperwork and on the form under severe reactions, it mentions dizziness, weakness, and difficulty breathing. While he is breath ok, he has noticed a slight degree of tightness in his chest. He did not see this listed but wants to know if this is normal or if it would be related to the difficulty breathing. His main concern is if this is a severe reaction. He had lab work done prior to getting the vaccine, then none afterward. The events did not require visit to emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the event &#39;lightheadedness&#39; was recovered while unknown for the other events.

Per report from primary care - the patients wife reports that the patient went on Saturday (1/30/21 - about 1050) morning to receive his COVID vaccine. He returned home and told her about the experience and denied any side effects. He then proceeded to sit in his easy chair for a while and around 1:30, she asked him if he wanted any lunch. The patient&#39;s wife reports he &#34;grumbled&#34; at her, and then got up to go to the bathroom. She then heard a loud crash and found him lying on the floor of the bathroom, with his head knocking hole in the wall as he fell. She could not detect a pulse. She called 911 and began compressions. First responders to the scene likewise tried to revive him but were not successful in her efforts. Per primary care documentation - Uncertain if related to Pfizer vaccine; vaccine administered on 1/30/21 and approximately 3 hours later suffered fatal MI at home.

(His 2nd is scheduled for 3/3) He started with sx ~13 hrs later - He started drifting out of consciousness, then had labored breathing through night rendering him unable to sleep. After getting up in the morning, his breathing was better but he felt lightheaded/weak through the day. By the next morning (Friday 2/12), he was so bad next morning that wife called 911 - He reports that he was there and then not there and was losing track of train of thought. He was taken to ER via EMS, where his HR was initially 15 - He was admitted to hospital - initially a temporary pacer was placed, then a permanent one on Monday, 2/22. He has had other episodes like this in past 13 mos. PCP referred him to neurologist and EENT. Neurology work-up, including MRI and 72 hr EEG were unremarkable, although he learned retrospectively that there was a time during EEG where HR was only 35. EENT found no auditory or other issues . *MD in ER told him that if issues were not neuro in nature, they were probably cardiac.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report. Outcome of events were reported as unknown.

                                                During my earlier years working in an industrial area I had inhaled asbestos which caused me to have plural thickening in my lungs. Every year since that diagnosis I have been required to annual Pulmanary (lung and heart) testing. On February 11th I had my 30th annual Pulmonary exam consisting of EKG, Stress Test, and Chest X-ray. As in the past, results were all good. On March 3rd I had my 1st Pfizer vaccination. Five days later on March 8th I collapsed, was taken to the hospital by ambulance having suffered a massive Pulmonary Embolism affecting my heart and right lung. During my 2 hour operation, Surgeons used a flexible suction tube inserted thru my groan to remove a large blood clot (embolectomy). Pieces totaling about 14cm long, 2cm wide and 1/2 cm thick. I was discharged 3 days later and instructed to take blood thinning medication probably for the rest of my life. I am now 78 years old.

Patient had some mild clinical decline the past few days prior to 2nd vaccination, with a decreased appetite and some increased fatigue per nursing report, but no significant changes. He experienced nausea on the evening of 1/6/21, which was effectively managed, but by early morning he spiked a fever of 102.9 with a sat of 86.1%.

Patient was hyperkalemic and in acute renal failure at time of transfer. Hyperkalemia was treated, but the patient suffered PEA vs VFib. At the time of transfer, patient was on vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. The patient had an EF of 40-45% and elevated troponins.  Patient was made DNR and placed on comfort care. Patient passed away on 1/18/2021. Ultimately we suspect that the patients condition was a direct result of his underlying disease states, but wanted to make sure reporting was made available.

                                                heart attack; chest pressure; hardly slept; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife).  An 80-year-old male patient (reported also as 81-years-old, to be clarified) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot # EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 80-years-old. Medical history included ongoing emphysema and ongoing diabetes (caller has been diagnosed for 35 years for both conditions), heart was damaged because of the diabetes, and a history of bypass 4 years ago however he hasn&#39;t had any issues with chest pressure since before the bypass. Concomitant medications were none. On 15Jan2021 at 1:am he developed pressure in the chest which ultimately resolved. This trouble last night, lasted over 1 hour. He couldn&#39;t get back to bed. He had to sleep sitting up on the sofa. That was the only way he was comfortable. Her husband has hardly slept. She was seeing how he was doing. He said he was okay sitting. The pressure on his chest would go away while he was sitting, but laying down it would come back. This morning (15Jan2021) she made him check when he woke up at 8 o&#39;clock. She made him lay down, and he said it was gone after sitting the whole night. He is well now. He is feeling fine. He didn&#39;t even ask for help getting on his clothes. He got the vaccine because of his age and because of underlying conditions. Her husband has done very well this year. He even has underlying conditions. He has had Emphysema for 35 years, but it hasn&#39;t been bothering him. He has also had diabetes for 35 years. The reporter spoke to her husband&#39;s hcp (nurse) who said it could have a heart attack and for him to go to hospital if it reoccurs. She did speak with a nurse with his primary doctor, and she said the pressure in his chest for 1 hour could have been a heart attack. That if it occurs again to give him the nitroglycerin. She told the nurse it wasn&#39;t pain. The reporter stated chest pressure could have been a heart attack. He is scheduled to get the 2nd dose on 21Jan2021. The reporter was wondering if her husband can have the second dose given it has potassium in it (given he has bypass history). The reporter is afraid the vaccine is not safe, and they may not go for the second vaccine. She wants more information if it is safe.  The events recovered on 15Jan2021.

Pt and his son exited the building and when they got to the car, the pt shouted out &#34;oh no!&#34; and collapsed to the ground. The patient was unconscious experiencing agonal respirations, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. There is an Emergency Room at the same location. Their staff came out and helped to transfer the pt to the ED for further evaluation. It was found that the patient had a known  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm (7/28/2017) that seemed to have ruptured. The patient was stabilized and transported to our local hospital and upon arrival, he was effectively comatose with a GCS 3. CT Head notated an extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage most probably related to a bleeding anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Neuro-Interventional Radiologist dictation reads &#34;Hunt Hess 5 Fisher grade 4 extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage and early hydrocephalus secondary to rupture of a known anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  Initial ICP after EVD placement noted to be in the 120s now 68 treatment complicated by aneurysm rerupture after admission and increased volume of blood although large volume of hemorrhage was seen on initial scan and no change in the patient&#39;s clinical exam on her scale was noted due to this rerupture.  Patient&#39;s exam and prognosis are poor giving extensor posturing lack of extraocular movements to doll&#39;s maneuver and weak pupillary reflex as well as cough and gag.  Follows no commands or instructions at this time with no spontaneous movement on ventilator set at 12 overbreathing at 14-16 at this time without any sedation.&#34; The family opted to discontinue any further treatment to include surgical intervention given the findings. The patient was given comfort care with son and daughter at the bedside. The patient was extubated and expired at 1545h on 2/13/2021.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.

                                                My 81-year-old father, and my brother received the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at the  Hospital  on Wednesday January 13, 2021. Within a couple of minutes of them returning home, my father collapsed. As it turns out, he&#39;d had a silent heart attack. He is still in the medical center area Hospital this morning. A cardiologist who was filling in for my father&#39;s primary cardiologist thought maybe my father had a blockage and might have needed a stent. But when Dr. performed a cardiac catheterization,  he only found a little plaque. Medical personnel are not too sure what caused the heart attack. My was very dehydrated when he was admitted, and he has underlying health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, dementia and a history of blood clots. Those are just a few of his health issues. His primary cardiologist, Dr is back in town. He plans to see if my father has AFib before they release him. I believe Dr. an internist at Hospital,  said my father&#39;s INR on admitting was 1.2. My father&#39;s hematologist, Dr.,  had told us to let the person administering the vaccine know that my father is on blood thinners. I was not present when my father and brother received the vaccine, but I assume my brother passed that information on to them.

Dizziness started in the morning 17Jan2021 when he got up he said good morning and then said he would bring her back a cup coffee then he became very dizzy and leaned against the wall for support and then he fell, he was okay but he fell. He did go the emergency room because he fell and hit was head and it was bleeding. They told him it was not related to the vaccine but it is one of the things that are on the form that could happen. She says it was okay if it caused it she is just looking for a reason.  Now today (18Jan2021) he feels fine she wants to know what causes that side effect. She says she is supposed to be getting her vaccine too. He had one bad dizzy spell and then it went away, and she thinks he got kind of nauseous with it. It says this can happen, it said it could happen right after but in his case it did not, it happened within probably 34 hours or something. Outcome of the event dizziness has recovered completely at this point. Outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                Stroke; like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283 and expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, intramuscular in left arm on 18Jan2021 13:10 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chicken pox, measles, and mumps (had chicken pox vaccine, measles, and mumps when he was younger, and he got the flu shot for flu). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The next day (19Jan2021) after receiving the injection, patient reported it was like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day. This went on for a couple of days before it improved. There was still a little bit in his left eye, but he can read and it has improved. He can see now and his eyes were improving. He found out that he had a stroke on 28Jan2021. He did not go to the hospital. He does not think the stroke affected anything else. He was supposed to have an MRI sometime this week. He went to the eye doctor and the eye doctor was the one that discovered the stroke and his eye doctor sent the report over to his primary office. He had a vision field test which was how the stroke was diagnosed. He was taking a baby aspirin and he will be put on a blood thinner called Plavix. He has not started Plavix yet, he has to go pick it up. Outcome of the event stroke was unknown while the other events was recovering.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

Without warning, he fell to the ground, losing control of bowel and bladder, although no seizure activity noted at the time.  He transiently lost consciousness and then woke up confused and combative.  Brought to emergency room and admitted with multiple rib fractures.  Initial brain imaging was negative but 24 hours later, noted to have small hemorrhagic brain contusion in left frontal/temporal region and a small subdural hematoma.  One day later, there was not noted to be any extension of the hemorrhage/hematoma.

She said that her dad passed out a week and a day after getting the vaccine and had been light headed. She said she was concerned that the second dose of the vaccine was supposed to be worse for effects, and she knew he was supposed to get it, but she wasn&#39;t sure that he should.  She said her dad would say to call his daughter, because he had a visual problem, which he had since before the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller said that NDC/EXP were not provided on the handwritten card. She said it said he got his first dose 25Jan2021. She said that the report she filed online asked what time he got the vaccine dose, and she put 09:45AM since it would not let her put 09:50AM, it was really at 09:50AM. Outcome of events were unknown.

An 82-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021, 13:00PM (at 82 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated in the Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included myeloid leukaemia (CML) diagnosed a few months earlier, WBCs abnormal, blood pressure, and heart surgery valve repair. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, vitamin d nos, dasatinib monohydrate (SPRYCEL) from an unknown date to help get WBCs back in normal range; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12), and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), all were received within 2 weeks of vaccination. At 82 years old, the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination and did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2. It was unknown if patient was tested for COVID post vaccination. On Friday (unknown date in Feb2021), patient&#39;s WBC was 150,000 and on Saturday (unknown date in Feb2021), patient had bilateral blood clots in legs that then went to lungs then went into BLAST crisis. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care as well as hospitalization due to life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the events). The patient was hospitalized for 12 days. Therapeutic measures which include steroids, blood thinners, and lots of other meds were administered. Outcome of the events &#34;patient&#39;s WBC was 150,000&#34; and &#34;bilateral blood clots in legs that then went to lungs then went into BLAST crisis&#34; was recovering.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject product contributed to the events. The reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.  Pulmonary embolism is known to be a potential complication of COVID 19 infection, including COVID 19 associated pneumonia.   There is limited information provided in this report. Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including pulmonary angiogram, VQ scan and coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Cardiac arrest Narrative:  An 82 year old, male, resident of a facility, received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12/30/20 (time of dose not known). On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name. Breathing was noted to be labored, and nurse was unable to detect a pulse. At 1509, 911 was called and CPR initiated. Spontaneous pulse and breathes resumed just before ambulance arrived at 1522. On arrival at the ED patient was responsive and breathing spontaneously, however, hemodynamically unstable. Patient went into cardiac arrest and code blue called at 1535. Received treatment with epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, amiodarone, atropine. Patient was intubated. EKG obtained and showed acute MI. At 1622 he again went into cardiac arrest and time of death was called.

An 83-year-old male (also age at vaccination) patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right (reported as Right upper arm) on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported that &#34;I have had one stent and one angioplasty done. Stent was done last year in 2020 and angioplasty was done in &#39;1990&#39; (not confirmed).&#34; The patient also added &#34;I gained a bunch of weight when I had my thyroid removed.&#34; The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date for Covid-19 immunization. For the concomitant medication the patient stated, &#34;Yes, I am taking medications.&#34; (specified medications not reported/ provided). It was reported by the patient that, &#34;I got this, my second COVID-19 Vaccine shot Saturday morning. All day Saturday (27Feb2021), all day Sunday and most of Monday, I was so sick, I didn&#39;t realize what was going on. Yesterday (02Mar2021), I ended up in the emergency room because I was having some problems with chest pain. So, I presume this is all connected to the second shot I got.&#34; It was added by the patient, &#34;I am asking question. About an hour or less than an hour ago I woke up, and my whole body felt like it was itching. I mean my whole body was just feeling funny. I was itching all over, that went away, I took a pill a while ago for that. &#39;Lorazepam&#39; (not confirmed over the call), it&#39;s a nerve, anxiety pill and it kind of helped. But right now, my feet are numb and cold.&#34; For the laboratory test the patient stated that, &#34;Yes they did a lab test on me yesterday (02Mar2021) as I went to the emergency room with some heart problems. They did blood work, that&#39;s all they did.&#34; The patient reported for the results, &#34;They said everything was fine.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient explained that &#34;No, I didn&#39;t take any medication for that.&#34; However treatment was received for Whole body felt like itching, whole body was just feeling funny.

The patient began having pain in his stomach and feet, and stayed pale and  nauseous. On 4/13/21 the patient was found in his bed saturated in blood and had soiled himself. His family called EMS and the patient went to Hospital. The patient coded and was not revived. The granddaughter stated  that he had an enlarge prostate that was discovered during one of his hospital visits in the past 3 weeks.

An 85-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included epilepsy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Caller says her father in law hasn&#39;t had seizure in years, it was diagnosed when he was a kid, 60-70 years ago).  There were no concomitant medications.  The reporter is calling on behalf of her father in law. She said he had his first dose of the COVID vaccine recently, she pulled this number off of the paperwork today. She says that she believes he had a side effect for it, and also he was rescheduled for his second dose. She says his second dose was supposed to be in 21 days but they rescheduled him for it at 18 days instead. She says he got the first dose on 11Jan, and they rescheduled his next for the 29th. She says she wanted to know if this was correct or ok. The reporter says that the following day he ended up having massive diarrhea, that it caused him while he was on the commode to pass out and he fell and hit his face, the best she can tell he was alone at the time. She says he did not go to the hospital for that, he got up and cleaned himself off and took a nap, and the nurse next door checked on him later on. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

                                                No adverse effects for the first two weeks.  The morning of 2/7/21 he claimed he was not able to sleep the night before.  He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

                                                Two nosebleeds; Heart skipped all day long; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 86-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EU9231, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for prevention; apixaban (ELIQUIS), oral from an unspecified date at 2.5 mg twice daily for thromboembolism prophylaxis; and ranolazine (RANEXA), oral from an unspecified date at 500 mg twice daily for an unspecified indication.  Medical history included bypass surgery in 2007, stent placement (5 stents), and 3 blocked arteries, diagnosed several years ago, he guesses he is living on half of them.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient received his first shot of COVID vaccine on 22Jan2021. The patient then experienced two nosebleeds, they did not ask if he had been on a blood thinner, he takes Eliquis, 2.5mg and Ranexa, so his question is a couple days, his heart skips beats anyway, but on the 13th day, it skipped all day long, so he was concerned about the other shot, he was supposed to get it today, he was concerned because he had bypass surgery, had 5 stents, 3 blocked arteries now that they can&#39;t do anything about. He was calling about COVID vaccine. He took it 3 weeks ago today and was supposed to get second shot. Concerned as to whether or not he should take it. He was supposed to get the second shot today (12Feb2021), doesn&#39;t know, but was really concerned about whether he should take or not. Nosebleeds were the 13th day after the shot (on 04Feb2021). He has recovered completely from nosebleeds. He stated he only bled for a couple seconds. Heart skipped all day long the 13th day after taking the shot (on 04Feb2021), states it is doing fine at this time, comes and goes, may skip one day, next day maybe 3 times and skip, then 4 times and skip, he guesses he has a crazy heart. The patient recovered from the event two nosebleeds on unspecified date, while unknown outcome for the remaining event. The action taken in response to the events for apixaban and ranolazine was unknown.   Additional information was also received by Pfizer from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (manufacturer control number: US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY-BMS-2021-016064), license party for Apixaban.   This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of EPISTAXIS (Two nosebleeds) and EXTRASYSTOLES (Heart skipped all day long) in 86-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) tablet for Thromboembolism prophylaxis. CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included ranolazine (Ranexa) tablet for an unknown indication and Covid-19 Vaccine injection for Prevention. The patient&#39;s past medical history included Bypass surgery in 2007, Stent placement and Arterial occlusion. On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (Oral), 2.5 milligram twice a day and Ranexa (Oral), 500 milligram twice a day. On 22-Jan-2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (unknown route) by injection once to left shoulder. On 04-Feb-2021, an unknown time after starting Eliquis, the patient experienced EPISTAXIS (Two nosebleeds) and EXTRASYSTOLES (Heart skipped all day long). The action taken with Eliquis(Oral) was unknown. At the time of the report, EPISTAXIS resolved and EXTRASYSTOLES outcome was unknown. For Eliquis(Oral), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments. Nosebleeds were the 13th day after the shot. He took shot on 22Jan2021. Has recovered completely from nosebleeds. States he only bled for a couple seconds. Heart skipped all day long the 13th day after taking the shot, states it is doing fine at this time, comes and goes, may skip one day, next day maybe 3 times and skip, then 4 times and skip, he guesses he has a crazy heart.

The next day the leg weakness was more significant and went to the emergency room where they found greater weakness in the left leg than the right leg. An MRI showed &#34;Punctate focus of diffusion restriction within the left cerebellar vermis consistent with acute infarct.&#34; He was also found to have a critically low platelet level of 30 and then 27 while in the emergency room. He was then admitted to the hospital, placed on steroids to increase his platelet level and given physical therapy following the stroke. He was admitted to the hospital for a total of 3 nights. He was discharged home on Aspirin, Carvedilol, and Atorvastatin, has follow up with hematology to check platelets and physical therapy.

An 87-year-old male received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 19Jan2021 at 16:00 at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 87-year-old. Lot number was EL3249. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, by-pass surgery in 1999 then high blood pressure in 1999, gout (diagnosed before 1999, it was an on and off thing, he had flare ups, the last one was at Christmas time), High cholesterol (diagnosed in 2000 or 2001), diabetes, anemia. Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) in 2014 for atrial fibrillation. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine in Sep2020 for immunization. On 20Jan2021, the patient was anemic. On 21Jan2021 at 02:30, nose bled. The patient just kept wiping his nose for thirty minutes before it stopped. On 20Jan2021, hemoglobin resulted 12.6, hematocrit was 3.9. The patient went to the hematologist the day before the report who said the patient was low on iron, hemoglobin and hematocrit were low, so he had to get an iron infusion the day of report for that (the patient went every three months and if his iron was low he got an infusion). The patient recovered from nose bled on 21Jan2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.

Before the vaccine, there was no problem with my heart rate.  Now, I am taking Labeatol 4 times a day to keep rate at least at 90.  This vaccine has doubled my heart rate.  It was 70 before the vaccine.  Now if I do not take my Labetalol, it goes up to 140.  Because my body is working so hard with that heart rate, it is making my sugar low.  So now I&#39;m taking less insulin and this whole situation is getting confusing on how to handle this long term, adverse reaction to the Pfizer vaccine.

Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

An 89-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in 10Jan2021 at 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient received one dose of Pfizer vaccine on 10Jan2021. The patient was presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan2021. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb2021 from respiratory failure from COVID19. It was unknown if autopsy was done. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination via nasal swab: covid-19 virus test positive on 27Jan2021. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, and patient died.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported COVID post vaccination and respiratory failure with fatal outcome, and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.  More information on the underlying medical condition in this 89-year-old male patient is required for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb from respiratory failure from COVID19; presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb from

Got first dose of COVID shot wed.. A&amp;Ox1. Has left sided weakness from prior CVA  History of Present Illness     89-year-old male who presents to the ER via EMS with confusion.  He has also reportedly had a cough and some fever.  There has been some report of incontinence of both bowel and bladder.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 3/17.  He and his wife have returned to the home after wintering in another state.  According to his wife, with whom I have spoken this evening, last night he suddenly became confused.  The confusion continued throughout the day today, thus prompting the EMS called to the house and the subsequent journey to the ED for further evaluation.   In the ER this evening, a battery of testing was completed.  A Covid swab is indeed positive.  His wife is uncertain of any positive contacts.  He had some vascular congestion on chest x-ray.  He has a prior history of pleural effusion which is thought to be resolved.  He does have a history of lower extremity edema.  He had some urinary incontinence and his wife held his Lasix Saturday morning.  He was noted to be slightly hypoxic around 88% on room air.  He was around 85% or so on room air at home with their home pulse oximeter device.  He has been placed on 2 L of nasal cannula.
