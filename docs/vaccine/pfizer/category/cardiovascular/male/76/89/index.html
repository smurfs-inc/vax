                                                Assessment: Individual stated he was feeling lightheaded approximately four minutes after receiving his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine via IM injection in his upper arm. Individual was seated at the time and was about to move from the vaccination station to the check out desk.  PT attempted to stand and said, ?Oh, I don?t feel so good?, after which vaccinator inquired with PT on what was wrong. After a brief assessment, notified personnel of the situation. Individual remained with the vaccinator, who obtained a set of vital signs and continued an assessment.  Vitals: (as I recollect, I gave the post it to the check out staffers who monitored the individual prior to his departure) BP: 126/54, P: 78, RR: 18, pale and sweating across his brow area. Denied chest pain, difficulty breathing, nausea, tingling, headache, stated only symptom was lightheaded ness which was dissipating. Provided the individual with bottled water to sip on, which he did. Individual?s last oral intake was at ~0845 PTA at the clinic, a normal breakfast of eggs, toast and coffee. Individual stated he had several cups of coffee but had not had anything else to drink that morning. Individual receives dialysis three days per week. He had an appointment Wednesday, next appointment is Friday. Individual did not have anyone driving him to the clinic, stated he would be fine and did not have anyone to come pick him up. He stated he was feeling better already.  After approximately 8 additional minutes, individual stated he thought he could get up and move to the check out station.  Individual was able to stand an ambulate to the check out line. Upon arrival at check out, transferred the individual to the check out personnel and Exit workers to monitor the individual?s condition for the remainder of the 30 minutes.

                                                On Saturday 2/6/21 in the morning on the left side under  armpit felt like he had a pulled muscle or something. It eventually radiated over up into the left quadrant of his chest where he could not push down on it.  It was extremely painful by Monday.  He has a history of esophageal spasms and exacerbated them to where he thought he was having a heart attack.  He called his Cardiologist and told him to go to the ER.  He went to the hospital Monday evening, he had two EKG&#39;s, had blood drawn 3 times, did sonograms looking for blood clots.  He did inform them that he had the vaccine on Friday and they told him it was due to that.  He went to nuclear medicine to get his lung checked for blood clots as well.  All tests were negative.  He saw his PCP today who told him that the lymph nodes were affected due to the vaccine.  He has improved greatly, still has some slight discomfort which his PCP said would go away in time.

Patient subsequently presented to the ED on 3/13/21 with a one day history of atypical chest pain and shortness of breath with walking and lying down. It is very unlikely that the vaccine is related to the patient&#39;s episode of chest pain. From a vaccination standpoint, it is safe for the patient to receive his second COVID vaccine as scheduled.

A 76-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm on 05Mar2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at the age of 76-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included congestive heart failure, aortic valve replacement couple of years ago. Concomitant medication includes aspirin 325mg once per day by mouth. On 05Mar2021, the patient went into Afib, his heart rate went up and the next day on 06Mar2021, his blood pressure dropped really low but his pulse went really high and carried it that way for a few days and then he went pretty much back to normal.  On 05Mar2021, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation for 22 hours and since that time his blood pressure and pulse have remained erratic. The reporter stated that the patient has returned to normal and his pulse is still a little high and his pulse used to run in the 70&#39;s and maybe 80 but today (15Mar2021), the pulse was still 95; on 06Mar2021, the patient took his blood pressure twice and is not sure at what time he checked it but one time it was 98/65 and the pulse was 114 at that time and the other time the blood pressure was 88/59 and the pulse was 115. States the patient&#39;s blood pressure pretty much turned back to normal on 10Mar2021 and the blood pressure started being normal on 10Mar2021. On 15Mar20021, the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 140/76 and the pulse is still real high at 95 today and he weighs himself, takes his blood sugar and blood pressure every day. Regarding the treatment, the reporter and the patient saw the patient&#39;s cardiologist this past Friday 12Mar2021 and put the patient on Metoprolol and the blood thinner Eliquis; states the patient was just taking a whole Aspirin and had previously had aortic valve replacement a couple of years ago and the HCP reduced his aspirin dose down to a low dose of Aspirin and then put him on the Eliquis at the HCP appointment. The reporter stated, for the Metoprolol and Eliquis she does not know the dosages or frequency of how the patient takes them at this time; states she has no lot numbers for the Metoprolol, Eliquis or Aspirin to provide as they are not with her at this time. The outcome of the event his blood pressure and pulse have remained erratic was not recovered; while the other events was recovered. Treatment has been given for the events.

After that had 1 hour of uncontolled severe shaking and shivering . Next day felt fine.  Afew days started noticing LOW FREQUENCY INTERMITTANT TINNITUS THAT IS A HUM, BUT ONLY IF I AM AROUND HIGH VOLTAGE POWER TRANSMISSION LINES AND POWER TRANSFORMERS .  HEAR IT IN MY HOME  WHICH IS 1000 FEET FROM HIGH VOLTAGE LINES 24/7 SINCE DAY 2-4 OF DOSE #1.  Can hear it in other enclosed areas, but doesn&#39;t seem to happen AS MUCH outdoors, although if I am within 1000 feet of high voltage lines I will hear it UNLESS  there are many trees to block the EMF&#39;s or HUM between me and the source.  SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT IS TRUE  FOR PAST 3 MONTHS 24/7 AND HAS RUINED MY LIFE BECAUSE I CANNOT SLEEP AND SLEEPING PILLS DON&#39;T WORK.   HAS DISRUPTED MY SLEEP CENTER SOMEHOW.  ALL OF THIS IS SINCE FIRST COIVD19 SHOT !  HAVE HAD #2 SHOT AND WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER !

A 76-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 (at the age of 76 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took NSAIDS. The patient experienced DVT L leg, possible PE on 12Mar2021. Treatment given included Eliquis. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events deep vein thrombosis and possible pulmonary embolism occurred in a plausible temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He had his nurse take an ECG and after his review he said that I had new onset Atrial Fibrillation.  He prescribed the blood thinner, Eliquis 5mg twice daily, and recommended that I schedule an appointment with my Cardiologist.  I had an appointment with cardiologist on 03/17/2021 and he confirmed my Atrial Fibrillation.  He scheduled me for a Transthoracic Echo (TTE) Complete with PRN definity on 04/08/2021 which was completed.   It must be noted that annual visits to my three doctors over a past period of 5 years, never showed that I had an irregular heartbeat or Atrial Fibrillation prior to its first discovery by PCP on 03/10/2021,  exactly one week after my second Pfizer Covid 19 vaccination.

                                                Feb 3, 2021.  Five days after first vaccination, had severe dizziness upon awakening.  Could barely stand up.  Dizziness and lightheadedness has persisted on and off for almost two months.  Felt much better for about 3 weeks and then it re-occurred and continues to this day (5/3/21).  On the evening of 4/29/21, actually passed out and hit the floor incurring head laceration.  Epley procedures have had no effect.  Doctors have not found cause.  Cardiologist has me starting on a monitor, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not the issue.  Dizziness comes and goes and is not always present.  Have never experienced these symptoms before.  No history of vestibular problems.  Very distressing.

I have never been diagnosed  with this, but have had infrequent bouts with PVC&#39;s. Diagnosis was made at  Hospital ER a few days after onset of symptoms. Visited my Cardiologist about a week after that, but by then my symptoms had disappeared. It is now about 3 months after this episode and I have had no irregular heartbeats since.

Treatment team COVID-19 virus infection Principal problem HPI: For complete history and physical see the H&amp;P dictated by Dr. on 4/28/2021.  This is a 76-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with upper respiratory symptoms for three days.  He reports having cough, sneezing, runny nose and poor appetite.  His caregiver had Covid recently and he was exposed.  He was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.   Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted inpatient to the medical surgical floor.  He was not on telemetry.  Patient reports that his caregiver had recently tested positive for Covid and he was exposed.  He has been having upper respiratory symptoms including cough, sneezing, and runny nose.  His COVID-19 test was positive.       He was started on the COVID-19 treatment protocol which included IV remdesivir and IV dexamethasone.  He underwent a CT scan of the chest which showed small patchy areas of groundglass infiltrates in the peripheral portions of the left and right upper lobes and also the posterior aspects of the right lung base.  These findings are probably due to pneumonia.        Hospital course consisted of gentle hydration with IV normal saline.  He was also started on antibiotic therapy oral azithromycin and IV Rocephin.  He had completed the course of antibiotics while on the unit, therefore, at the time of discharge no antibiotics were prescribed.  He initially was hypoxic and started on nasal cannula oxygen to maintain pulse oximetry greater than 92%.  Eventually, oxygen was weaned and pulse oximetry on room air has remained in the 95-96% range.       He has a history of diabetes mellitus and while on the unit blood glucose levels have fluctuated.  His point-of-care glucose have been in the 80-500 range.  He has had numerous episodes of hypoglycemia and insulin has been adjusted.  The fluctuations of the blood glucose levels may be secondary to IV dexamethasone.  At the time of discharge he will continue dexamethasone 6mg daily for the next three days.  He was advised to increase insulin 70/25 insulin five units daily for the next thre days.  After that time he can return to his normal dose of insulin.  He also had been treated with IV remdesivir and had completed the 5-day course.      On examination today he has been asymptomatic.  He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  The initial lab studies showed an elevated creatinine level, although he has a history of chronic kidney disease.  At the time of discharge the creatinine level trended downward and he was advised to follow-up with the primary care provider for possible repeat BMP in 1 to 2 weeks.  All other lab studies have been within normal limits.        The systolic blood pressure has been in the 120-150 range.  The most recent systolic blood pressure was 151/66 mmHg with a heart rate of 66 bpm.  He denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.  He was advised to continue all of his current medications.  While on the unit he was in isolation secondary to COVID-19.  At the time of discharge he should maintain social distancing/isolation, mask wearing and good handwashing.  He will will need to follow-up with the primary care provider.  He was also advised if the oxygen level dips below 89% he will need to return to the emergency department.  At this time he is resting comfortably, offers no complaints and is stable for discharge.       Patient is alert, oriented answering all questions appropriately.  He is continent of bowel and bladder.   Heis able to make his own decisions.  He is able to performhis own ADLs.  .  At this time he is in agreement with the plan and feels comfortable to be discharged home. Thank you.

Relevant medical history included ongoing Type V hyperlipidaemia (12Aug2020), ongoing Coronary artery disease (31Oct2018), ongoing elevated Prostatic specific antigen (PSA; 10Jun2014), ongoing extradural extramedullary spinal tumor (04Apr2018), ongoing Dizziness (04Apr2018), ongoing Obesity (03Mar2021), Acute kidney injury (AKI), swelling of joint right upper arm, urinary tract infection associated with indwelling catheter (05Jun2020), pneumonia due to COVID-19 virus (hospitalized for two and one half months; 26Apr2020-02Jun2020), pneumonia due to COVID-19 virus (05Jun2020), restless leg syndrome, depression, and Atrial fibrillation (Afib), stent in his heart, and chest pain. Concomitant medications included pramipexole dihydrochloride for restless leg syndrome from unspecified date; venlafaxine hcl for depression from 1992; atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR) for unspecified indication from unspecified date; SOTALOL for Afib from an unspecified date; tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX) for unspecified indication from unspecified date; apixaban (ELIQUIS) for unspecified indication from unspecified date; and esomeprazole magnesium (NEXIUM) for unspecified indication from 1998. The patient also received unspecified concomitant medications for the stent in his heart though he could not recall the name. The patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (solution for injection; Lot EWO171 expiry information not provided) as a single dose in the left upper arm an 19Apr2021 (at 76 years-old) for COVID-19 immunization and experienced no adverse effect. The patient reported that on 19May2021 when he got home, he passed out and had to be taken by ambulance. When questioned, the reporter stated he had to have passed out. The patient reported that de does not really know, except he could not move; described as &#39;had a heck of a time moving&#39;. The patient reported that he literally defecated himself among other things. The patient reported that his neighbor heard him screaming and called an ambulance who took the patient to the hospital, the emergency hospital and then the hospital itself. The patient reported that he was hospitalized from 21May2021 to 24May2021. The patient yawned and stated that this was another problem, the fatigue. The outcome of the events passed out, defecated himself, and could not move was recovering. The outcome of the fatigue was unknown.

About a week after I saw my cardiologist and the atrial fibrillation had resolved itself, I was in A fib for about 5 or 6 days. I was in sinus rhythm now.

                                                He was sent to the ER later that day when he complained of headache and palpitations and his blood pressures and heart rate were unusually high.  He had at no time any chest pain.   At the ER, he had two serial troponins at 0.06, representing a mild enzyme leak.  He had no EKG changes concerning for ischemia or arryhtmia but his BP was noted to be in 170/100&#39;s which is higher than his baseline in the 140&#39;s.  It came down on its own eventually.  It was determined that if anything, he may have ha some demand ischemia from his hypertension, and that in the future he should at least get a TTE, or if he can tolerate, a cardiac stress test.  He returned without any medication changes.

Patient transferred from Spinal Cord Injury until to ICU on 1/11/2021 due to worsneing dyspnea, hypoxia (80s) and tachycardia and was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure likely 2/2 multifocal pneumonia. CXR findings of &#34;There is interval increase in patchy airspace infiltrates and consolidation in bilateral lungs concerning for pneumonia&#34; Patient was started on vancomycin and pip/tazo on 1/11 and tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained for VAP diagnosis which ultimately grew Serratia liquifaciens and Proteus mirabilis. Infectious Diseases was consulted who recommended a switch to ertapenem therapy for a total 10 day course for VAP. UCx/BCx remained negative. On 1/20, a therapeutic bronchoscopy was completed with cultures growing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and pan-S Klebsiella pneumoniae. The following day a chest tube was inserted and the course of ertapenem completed but vancomycin was continued. By 1/22, patient developed shock liver with ALT/AST 2135/1579 from normal range the day prior and SCr increased to 1.3 from baseline 0.7/cystatin C of 2.46 up from 1.15. Levofloxacin was added for Stenotrophomonas coverage. By 1/25, patient&#39;s clinical status continued to decline and Cardiology was consulted for new onset Afib with RVR. Discussion was documented with patient&#39;s family who requested DNR. Patient passed away in the early AM on 1/26.

On 2/17 (three days after vaccination), he sought care in the emergency department for chest pain that worsened when he was supine and shortness of breath.   EKG in the emergency room showed STEMI and troponin levels were normal. He was transferred to a different facility for cardiac catheterization. Cath showed mild circumflex disease and a stent was placed. He was diagnosed with pericarditis at that time (elevated inflammatory markers ESR/CRP). He was discharged home post cath on Plavix/ASA.   He had an echocardiogram at his PCP?s office on 2/25, results still pending (as of 3/10).  2/25 ? televist with cardiologist who concurred with pericarditis, maybe mild coronary artery disease (follow-up scheduled 3/11).  3/3 chest pain symptom improved further, no cough, improved shortness of breath.      Medications at home: statin, previously colchine for gout, likely BP medication (PCP will send records)  Allergies: None known.  Vaccine Indication: Age &gt;75

This 77-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 09:30 AM (at the age of 77-year old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, heart failure, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and allergy to lisinopril. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin (LIPITOR), metformin, losartan, potassium and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN). On 05Feb2021 at 01:30 PM, after 3 days from the first dose of vaccine, the patient experienced a stroke that resulted in hospitalization for 4 days. Treatment included CAT scan, MRI (with unknown results) and intravenous blood thinner. The outcome of the event was recovering. The event was serious due to hospitalization and life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

This happened about 5 weeks after the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Had blood work, showed very low blood counts to the point of maybe needing a transfusion.   Had GI work up today, no bleeding.   Could this be an autoimmune reaction to the vaccine.  His blood counts were fine prior to the vaccine.

After the second dose of vaccine, the hematuria worsened so much so that he was just leaking blood from the urethra even without urination. With urination he was passing frank blood and clots.  He stopped clopidogrel and aspirin and it totally resolved.  He underwent cystoscopy and there were no lesions identified.  He resumed clopidogrel and aspirin and has not had any more bleeding.

Uncommonly tired, no headache fever, chills, or neurodeficit otherwise.  ( I am a retired physician).  This lead to change in gait: slow, foot dragging, unstable.  Near accident in driving auto.  More than 4 time of urinary incontinence ie incontinence when bladder overfilled.  Mental clarity lost.  speech impaired by word searching.  Obvious change in behavior to those around me.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: CR2613), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Mar2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included broke femur of right leg on 09Nov2020 and hospitalized from 09Nov2020 until 15Nov2020 or 16Nov2020, surgery to repair broken right femur on 12Nov2020, rehabilitation following hospital discharge and got out of the rehab facility on 14Dec2020, been in either a walker or a wheelchair and still not fully recovered (ongoing); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma diagnosed at least 13-14 years ago,  bronchitis, all ongoing from an unspecified date diagnosed at least 13-14 years ago. Concomitant medications were not reported. There were no other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced a blood clot in the leg. The clinical course was follows: After he was discharged from rehab, the patient went to his own family doctor on 30Mar2021 because his ankle and leg were still swollen. The physician sent him to have a vascular done, on an unspecified date after 30Mar2021, with unknown results. The patient reported that the physician determined that he had blood clots in his leg. The patient was sent to the emergency room and started &#34;that stuff&#34; for about a week until he went to a regular vascular doctor and the physician determined what the patient should be doing. The patient reported that he was diagnosed with the blood clots after he got out of rehab. The patient received apixaban (ELIQUIS) from Apr2021 for blood clot in leg. The clinical outcome of blood clot in leg was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : PFIZER INC-2021478767 same patient, different dose/event

He had presented to the ED with the same complaints on 5/29/21 but was discharged back to his group home. On the 5/29 visit, he was tested for COVID as part of standard protocol, and was found to be COVID positive (asymptomatic) despite receiving 2 doses of Pfizer vaccine (1/15 and 2/5). On the 6/7 ED visit, pt was initially found to be hypoxic (89% on room air) in the ED, but once he was admitted and transferred to the COVID floor, he was found to be 95% on room air and supplemental O2 was discontinued. Patient has remained asymptomatic for COVID during his hospitalization, and has not required COVID treatment.

                                                I had the vaccine on 01/16/2021 and my heart stopped. I had a long period of Atrial fibrillation, my heart will stop for 8 seconds and then it will start again. I had like 3 or 4 fainting episodes. Since then, I have had a heart pacer implanted. They put a Halter monitor to check my heart behavior. I was already under treatment for the fibrillation but this was an exaggeration of this problem.  My cardiologist told me to come in because I had the monitor and they saw that my heart was stopping so I went in since it was an emergency. They kept me in the hospital for 3 days because they wanted to keep me in observation before they put the pace maker in.

                                                spiking of his blood pressure; sore arm; legs swollen; pain on one leg; on and off nausea; not feeling right; This is a spontaneous report  from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (Lot number was not reported) at the age of 77 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. On an unspecified date the patient experienced spiking of his blood pressure, sore arm, legs swollen, pain on one leg, on and off nausea, not feeling right.  The patient had lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 190/80.  The clinical outcome of the events was unknown. The clinical course was reported as follows: 77-year-old caller reported receiving his second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 24Feb2021 and experienced a &#34;sore arm&#34; after. He explained that a week after vaccination, on the Monday, he &#34; woke up with his legs swollen and pain on one leg&#34;. He stated he also experienced spiking of his blood pressure (BP), however on Monday 03Mar2021 he went to the ER since his BP rose over 190/80. He explained at the ER, he guessed they got him more call, and he received a prescription of &#34;water pills&#34; to take for &#34;a couple weeks&#34;.  He added then, there were moments when he &#34;didn&#39;t feel right&#34;. He specified he would be &#34;good&#34; in the morning then he &#34;just didn&#39;t feel right&#34; in the afternoon. He reported about a month later, 13Apr2021 he had a &#34;second incident with the spiking&#34; of his BP, which led him to the ER. He explained his cardiologist then changed his amlodipine prescription to &#34;5mg in the morning and 5mg at night&#34;. He explained he would take 1 pill of Amlodipine 10mg in the morning before vaccination. He added he would take 5mg of amlodipine for a year before being increased to that 10mg a day.  He explained before vaccination, he &#34;never experienced such spiking with his BP and considers himself healthy for his age. DSU agent reported his BP is generally around 120/70 and he routinely use the treadmill. He mentioned he now seems ok, has not have a &#34;violent&#34; BP spike, but has &#34;not felt 100%&#34; yet. He added some days he is &#34;fine&#34; and others he has &#34;on and off nausea&#34; or he &#34;feels his legs are swollen in the evening&#34;. The main reason for his call is to see if Pfizer have any experience with people who have covid, the long haulers, with the effects for quite a while, that are 3 months in. He was wondering whether or not any long hauler folks that have had on and off side effects attributed it to the vaccine.    Information about Lot Batch number has been requested.

Whenever I try to walk up a sloping street my legs, esp. the calves, become fatigued and it is difficult to continue. Once I am on level ground or walking downhill normal feeling returns. This is now the fourth month of this condition. Blood test on 03/31/2021 indicated the following values: C-Reactive Protein 93.6; Red Blood Cell Count 3.89; Hemoglobin 11.3; Platelet Count 610. White blood cell count was normal (7.9). A CT scan on 04/17/2021 was normal. Am waiting insurance approval for a cardiac catheterization to determine blockage of the arteries to the legs.

When my blood pressure became dangerously low, I was moved back to just 20mg Olmesartan. Atrial fibrillation had been controlled prior to the vaccination with Multaq. For two days after the vaccination I had A-fib, then it went away. I have been monitoring my blood pressure and EKG since and the A-fib is becoming increasingly common, so that now I seldom had sinus rhythm.

This is a 77 years old gentleman with a history of COPD presents to the emergency department because of shortness of breath and chest pain.  Patient states that he was in his usual state of health and suddenly developed shortness of breath and chest tightness. By the time of my evaluation he no longer has chest tightness.  He was recently in the hospital and treated with antibiotics for Pseudomonas pneumonia.  He is reportedly compliant with his COPD medications at home.  He normally wears 2 L nasal cannula at home.  Currently he is on the BiPAP and reports feeling better after treatment in the emergency department.  He was given IV steroids, bronchodilator therapy.  He was also given IV antibiotics given recent history of Pseudomonas pneumonia.  Of note patient states that for the past week his bilateral ankle appears to be more swollen and he is on Lasix started by Dr. from pulmonology for this.  6/21/21: This patient with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation and chronic dementia, was again admitted 6/16 with increasing shortness of breath and chest pain.  It was noted that his COVID 19 test was positive.  He was started on IV Remdesivir, but since his COVID 19 test has been positive since March of this year was felt that he did not require additional treatment.  We are treating him for an exacerbation of COPD.  His chest x-ray was actually normal with COPD but no signs of infiltrate, heart failure or effusions.  He is on apixaban for atrial fibrillation and should not have a pulmonary emboli.  He was getting IV Lasix, but the BUN and creatinine were rising.  We have obtained an echocardiogram to see if there is a degree of systolic heart failure.  We will continue the IV antibiotics and steroid therapy.  The patient seems comfortable at rest but is on 5 L nasal cannula.  The patient reports that he is on 3 L of oxygen at home all the time.  I called to talk to the good friend who is listed as the 1st contact and reviewed the situation.  He does live by himself but has 24 hour a day care.  We discussed that our goal was to get him back down to 2-3 L of oxygen.  There seems to be some improvement but if still requires 5-6 L of oxygen, we will ask for a pulmonary consultation.  I have talked to the pulmonary team several times unofficially for advice and they seem to have nothing else to offer at this time.  Again today the patient seems comfortable and is warning why he can go home.Admitted and treated with bronchodilators, steroids, BiPAP and levaquin. Echocardiogram repeated. By the time of admission, chest pain resolved. Oxygen requirement stay high at 5 liters. Today improved to baseline 2 L. Discharged home.

This 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EK5730), via an unknown route, on 17Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 78-year-old. The patient was diabetic and hypertensive. Additional medical history included hyperlipidaemia. No relevant concomitant medications were provided. On 18Dec2020, the patient developed severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body. On 19Dec2020, the patient developed achy. On 20Dec2020, the patient was dehydrated and hypotensive, he had also chills.  On unknown date, blood pressure was down to 76/50. His symptoms for COVID were severe achy cramps, hypotension, and dehydration. On 20Dec2020, COVID-19 test was positive. On 21Dec2020, the patient was given monoclonal antibodies.  A computerized tomogram (CT) of the lungs was performed on 21Dec2020 and it was ok. A week later (Dec2020), he had a repeat CT which showed increased infiltrates of 10 to 15%. He then started on dexamethasone, apixaban (ELIQUIS) and the rest of the things. He had a repeat CT on 05Jan2021 which showed resolution of the infiltrates; most of the lesions went gone. CT results had improved significantly. The patient underwent a second COVID test a week ago which was still positive. He had a third COVID on 06Jan2021, but results were not available yet. The patient queried if he can proceed with second dose planned on 07Jan2021 or if he should wait. The clinical outcome was recovered for the event &#39;severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body&#39; on 19Dec2020, for &#39;dehydration/dehydrated&#39; on 20Dec2020, for &#39;chills&#39; on unknown date in Dec2020, for &#39;achy&#39; on 30Dec2020, for &#39;hypotensive&#39; on 20Dec2020; the outcome of the event &#39;CT showed increased infiltrates 10-15%&#39; was recovering; the outcome for &#39;Tested positive for COVID-19&#39; was unknown.  The reporter considered the events &#39;achy&#39; and &#39;severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body&#39; serious because causing disability; the events &#39;tested positive for COVID-19&#39;, &#39;dehydration/dehydrated&#39;, &#39;chills&#39; and &#39;hypotensive&#39; were considered medically significant.  The reporter considered the events &#39;Tested positive for COVID-19&#39;, &#39;CT showed increased infiltrates 10-15%&#39; and &#39;dehydrated/dehydration&#39; unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  Case will be reassessed when new information is received.

                                                Lightheadedness; Headache; tightness in his chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EK4176, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm/ shoulder area on 15Jan2021 at 11:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, patient has epilepsy that has been controlled since 1977; and issues with his blood pressure. He has no allergies. Concomitant medications included phenobarbital and phenytoin (DILANTIN), both for epilepsy. He takes HTZ TRI something, it is a long word but is basically 2 diuretic. He is also being followed by a cardiologist. Patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient got the COVID injection 2.5 hours ago on 15Jan2021 and after that he had a slight case of lightheadedness. He was instructed to drink water and walk if he was able, he did that and it helped. The patient relays that he was fasting that morning and thinks that had some degree of relatedness in the lightheaded feeling. He ate lunch and the light headedness resolved but now he has a slight headache. He was reading the paperwork and on the form under severe reactions, it mentions dizziness, weakness, and difficulty breathing. While he is breath ok, he has noticed a slight degree of tightness in his chest. He did not see this listed but wants to know if this is normal or if it would be related to the difficulty breathing.

A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EN5318; dose 1) intramuscularly on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 78-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 25Jan2021 during the 15 minute waiting period after the vaccine, the patient experienced dizziness. He denied difficulty breathing and swallowing. A differential diagnosis of systemic reaction (hypoglycemia, hypotension, generalized rash) was provided. The patient was given unspecified treatment and follow-up response was good. The patient denied dizziness when standing up and walking to leave the medical evaluation bay and clinical outcome of dizziness was completely resolved prior to discharge.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Went to bed and by mid afternoon shivers were gone as well as sweating. Slept all day and into the evening, by 10pm or so all seemed back to normal. Mid afternoon I sat up on the edge of the bed to go to the bathroom and passed out falling on my left knee (bad one) and hit my forehead on the bathroom door scraping and bruising same above left eye brow. Walking with pain in left knee but getting better daily.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report. Outcome of events were reported as unknown.

                                                During my earlier years working in an industrial area I had inhaled asbestos which caused me to have plural thickening in my lungs. Every year since that diagnosis I have been required to annual Pulmanary (lung and heart) testing. On February 11th I had my 30th annual Pulmonary exam consisting of EKG, Stress Test, and Chest X-ray. As in the past, results were all good. On March 3rd I had my 1st Pfizer vaccination. Five days later on March 8th I collapsed, was taken to the hospital by ambulance having suffered a massive Pulmonary Embolism affecting my heart and right lung. During my 2 hour operation, Surgeons used a flexible suction tube inserted thru my groan to remove a large blood clot (embolectomy). Pieces totaling about 14cm long, 2cm wide and 1/2 cm thick. I was discharged 3 days later and instructed to take blood thinning medication probably for the rest of my life. I am now 78 years old.

                                                Patient had second dose of Pfizer vaccine in morning. That afternoon began complaining of abdominal pain with subsequent vomiting (x2) and possible diarrhea. Patient could not sleep that evening . Awoke next morning with continued abdominal pain throughout the day and ultimately was found unresponsive in bed. Transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Subsequently autopsy was performed which revealed significant pre-existing hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with evidence of acute myocardial infarction. There is no clear evidence that this is related to the vaccination, however it is being reported due to potential public health interest and temporal proximity to vaccination.

                                                A little over a week ago I was admitted to a local hospital having been diagnosed with Guillain?Barré syndrome, a debilitating condition where the body?s auto immune system attacks the nervous system resulting in peripheral numbness in one?s hands, feet and legs. This condition was diagnosed by a neurologist. Following his diagnosis, I spent 8 days in the Hospital and was treated for 5 days with a daily dose of 400ml of immune globulin (IVIG) to rebuild the damage to my nervous system.   On April 10, I began to feel the onset of Guillain Barré syndrome as the bottoms of my feet suddenly began to tingle and feel numb. The next day I tripped while returning our waste management garbage cans to our garage.  Fell face forward onto the driveway and was bruised pretty bad.  The next day my BP zoomed to 224/160.  911 was called and I was taken to our local hospital fearing and thinking that I was having a heart attack.  I spent 4 days in the hospital being checked for a possible heart attack and all the while my Guillain Barré syndrome was progressing undiagnosed.  I was discharged and instructed to see a neurologist for the tingling and numbness in my hands, legs and feet.  Within 15 minutes of the neurologist consult,  a few days following my discharge, I was told I had Guillain Barré syndrome and get to a hospital. I left his office and went straight to the emergency room and I spent the next 8 days there and was discharged Tuesday, 4 May 2021. Several hospital neurologists treating me  believed the vaccination triggered the syndrome as do I.  It&#39;s not being widely reported even though there have been several Facebook postings of people saying the same thing as me.

                                                DVT was twice as bad; death/natural process; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse reporting for reporter&#39;s husband. A 78-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (reported as COVID vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 20Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6201; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as 2nd dose, single (at the age of 78-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes, Liver cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, Kidney stone, sarcoidosis, blood pressure abnormal, high cholesterol, pacemaker and they putted the IVC filter for blood clot. Concomitant medications included insulin, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide and omeprazole (PROTONIX), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EN6201; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) on 27Feb2021 at the age of 78-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on 12Mar2021, and went into the hospital 12Mar2021. Then the patient had the second COVID shot on 20Mar2021 and the reporter had taken him right back into the hospital couple days later because the DVT got twice as worst. The patient experienced DVT was twice as bad on an unspecified date in Mar2021, which required hospitalization on 22Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests, he had lab tests on 22Mar2021 when he went in and he probably had them on 23rd and 24th of Mar2021. The reporter didn&#39;t know what all the lab tests were done in the hospital. The patient died on 12Apr2021. The reporter stated they put Reason of death as natural process because she sent him in the Hospice. An autopsy was not performed. The outcome of event DVT was unknown. The reporter considered there was a causal relationship, when he got his second COVID shot on 20Mar2021 and then he went back in the hospital on 22Mar2021 and the DVT was twice as bad.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported DVT.

After second shot, episodes averaged four per week for six weeks. I went to the ER April 4 and was referred to electrophysiologist. I saw electrophysiologist on April 15, he immediately scheduled me for double cardiac ablation. I had this procedure on May 7, whereupon my episodes ceased.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6201; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 78-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, Liver cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, kidney stone, sarcoidosis, blood pressure (unspecified condition) and high cholesterol and a pacemaker (cardiac pacemaker insertion). Concomitant medications included insulin (manufacturer unknown), simvastatin (manufacturer unknown), hydrochlorothiazide (manufacturer unknown), carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure, and omeprazole (PROTONIX).  On 12Mar2021, the patient developed pulmonary embolism and DVT (deep vein thrombosis) that requiring a hospitalization on 12Mar2021. The nurse reported, &#34;He went into the hospital 12Mar2021 that&#39;s when they find out he had pulmonary embolism and DVT. They putted the IVC filter for blood clot.&#34; On 12Mar2021, the patient was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism and DVT. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pulmonary embolism and DVT. The clinical outcome of the events pulmonary embolism and DVT was unknown.  Additional information has been requested and will be provided as it becomes available.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it  is unlikely that the reported  pulmonary embolism and DVT (deep vein thrombosis) were causally related to BNT162b2 .  These are intercurrent  medical conditions.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

It never happened before and has not occurred again since the beginning of April. Second symptom which was not reported was a raw feeling in the center of the chest between the lungs. This had never occurred before and started April time frame and as of late June has disappeared. Third symptom is getting out of breath with what I would consider minor exertion. Discussed with primary care and heart doctor both considered it to be age-related. But walking 200 yards and being out of breath for someone that is not overweight seems unlikely.

His sister who accompanied him has been checking on him daily and has noted worsening bouts of coughing as well as shortness of breath, unable to keep up with ADLs. Upon checking on him today she noted that his lips were blue, brought in to the emergency department by private passenger car and in trial urge his oxygen saturation was noted to be 64% on room air. He was immediately started on supplemental oxygen via OxyMask, nebulizer therapy. COVID-19 rapid antigen test was subsequently positive, CT pulmonary angiogram was done which is negative for PE but also did not demonstrate any evidence of pneumonia. He is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 since March, denies any known contacts being treated for or with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. While in the ED continued to deteriorate requiring increasing amounts of oxygen via OxyMask, desaturating to 82-85% on 15 L OxyMask. Has been started on NIPV and will be admitted to the ICU for further treatment and evaluation. Of note, he reports that he and 5&#43; of his family members were all fully vaccinated and all tested positive to COVID around the same time.  6/14/21: The patient presented to the hospital on May 24 with cough and shortness of breath, COVID-19 test positive, initially he was hypoxic requiring 6 L of oxygen then his oxygen demand increased until he require to be on BiPAP and high-flow nasal cannula, then on May 29th require endotracheal intubation the ICU and started on Remdesivir, Decadron, but he was not candidate for Acterna, on June 3rd the patient had a fall with dislodged endotracheal tube require immediate re-intubation and his CT show simple nondisplaced skull fracture and subgaleal small hematoma without intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient extubated on June 6 to BiPAP then the oxygen requirement taper down. The patient post extubation kept having shortness of breath and cough, sputum culture grow Klebsiella pneumonia and he was on Zosyn which cover it and will complete the antibiotic on June 15th. The patient is hypercoagulable with elevated D-dimer 2 to COVID-19 infection and will continue Lovenox b.i.d. with his aspirin and Plavix for CAD with pantoprazole.  Will continue his chronic steroid. The pulmonologist recommend to keep the patient in isolation due to prolonged virus shedding.  On per oral Vanco for C diff prophylaxis due to history of recurrent C diff infection and he is currently on antibiotic. Echocardiogram showed normal EF without significant valvular disease. Patient had episodes of dysphagia and swallow studies show some aspiration and he placed on pureed diet/dysphagia level 1. Sign-out given to SELECT LTAC team, they will follow on management.

There is no provoking risk factor that I can clearly identify (no recent surgeries, trauma, immobilization, or active cancer). He does have a remote cancer hx of bladder cancer in 2015. He is a former smoker 20&#43; years ago. However, he is at risk for VTE events by being a ERSD patient and also there&#39;s increased risk for VTE for pts &gt;70yo. His COVID vaccination a few months ago is a potential contributing risk factor, will report to VAERS

                                                loss of consciousness; respiratory distress Narrative: Patient tolerated his 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccine well, on 12/16/2020, and received his 2nd dose on 1/6/2021. Patient had some mild clinical decline the past few days prior to 2nd vaccination, with a decreased appetite and some increased fatigue per nursing report, but no significant changes. He experienced nausea on the evening of 1/6/21, which was effectively managed, but by early morning he spiked a fever of 102.9 with a sat of 86.1%. He continued to deteriorate from that point on and died 1/7/21 @13:20. Clinically, the presentation was most consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.

Patient was hyperkalemic and in acute renal failure at time of transfer. Hyperkalemia was treated, but the patient suffered PEA vs VFib. At the time of transfer, patient was on vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. The patient had an EF of 40-45% and elevated troponins.  Patient was made DNR and placed on comfort care. Patient passed away on 1/18/2021. Ultimately we suspect that the patients condition was a direct result of his underlying disease states, but wanted to make sure reporting was made available.

An elderly 79 years old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number and expiry date were not provided) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications includes Aspirin. The reporter informed that her father (patient) received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday (17Jan2021) and today (18Jan2021), he experienced nose bleed. The patient had a nose bleed which lasted for a pretty long time. The patient just tried to stop it in a regular way. Just pinching the nose and stuff like that. The reporter did not know if there is any other medication that he takes only the Aspirin. The reporter just wanted to know if this was normal side effect. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (18Jan2021): New information received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) included: concomitant drug, event details.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Concomitant medications included empagliflozin (JARDIANCE), dulaglutide (TRULICITY), and other medications (as reported &#34; I take stuff for blood pressure all kind of stuff&#34;). The patient reported that he got the vaccine on Tuesday (12Jan2021), he stated that he has diabetes and stuff and he noticed on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday his sugar was elevated a whole lot and he thought that would be possibly from the vaccine or it might be stressed because the Covid (unspecified). He stated that he doesn&#39;t know but it&#39;s unusual, he means it went real high. He wanted to know if there are any reports of like affects it might cause on hi sugar to go high. The patient checked this morning (unspecified date) it was high and just checked about 20 minutes ago and it has come down again so (further not clarified).&#34; The patient mentioned that he takes Jardiance and Trulicity, once a week; he took Trulicity this morning (unspecified date) and stated, &#34;so that probably helped&#34;. He had an unspecified laboratory test about 3 months ago, and there was no problem.&#34; The outcome of event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 79-(unit: unknown)-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN5318, NDC number, UPC number and Expiry Date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation at the vaccination facility. COVID Vaccine was a Pfizer product. COVID Vaccine manufacturer was unspecified. Reason for no lot number of COVID Vaccine stated by consumer as he don&#39;t know. He stated &#34;I had little card Pfizer EN5318 (further not clarified). There is another number here, I think it D-6152061100.&#34; Medical history included a heart disease (A-Fib) (Intent: History) for which the patient takes Eliquis, losartan ,metoprolol and pravastatin and a heart condition. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS), losartan, metoprolol, pravastatin; all for A-Fib. Caller (patient) stated &#34;I receive my first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 28Jan2021. I felt really tired (in Jan2021) for a week after receiving the vaccine. I have a heart disease (A-Fib) for which I take Eliquis, losartan, metoprolol and pravastatin.&#34; He noticed a slight increase in his blood pressure and heart rate post vaccination. He had the tendency to monitor his blood pressure and heart rate on regular basis but had been monitoring closely post vaccination. His normal vital signs were around Blood pressure:120/70 to 80 and Heart Rate: 50 -60. However he noticed his BP was high as 139/95 (in 2021) and heart rate 95-103 (in 2021) which is not his normal. His blood pressure is steady now but pulse is always elevated. On 11Feb2021 patient stated &#34;Started to feel very weak. My blood pressure had gone up; Blood pressure was 139 over 95. Heart rate almost doubled: 97 heart rate. Patient stated, &#34;I took the COVID first shot and my age is 79. I took the first shot of the COVID Vaccine on 28Jan2021, around 1 pm in the afternoon at the vaccination facility (a 2 year college, they were doing it outside of the college). I think I had a reaction to it (in 2021). Normally my blood pressure is 110 to 125 on top and I don&#39;t know 65 up to 80 on the bottom and my heart is normally between 50 to 65. That&#39;s my normal heart rate. I am pretty healthy and I do a lot exercise and lot of power walking, so my heart rate is &#39;not so&#39; low. That afternoon (28Jan2021) I walk, my power walk training miles. I started to feel very weak and at night I took my blood pressure it wasn&#39;t too bad. It was 139 over 78 with a 61 heart rate and then next morning I woke up and my blood pressure had gone up to medically and heart rate almost doubled. Next morning (29Jan2021) at 10 am my blood pressure was 139 over 95 and a 97 heart rate. It kind of continued, I have been writing this all down and monitoring it and blood pressure has come down to some degree but my heart rate continue to be elevated but my blood pressure like this morning, I do in January because I have heart condition and I have Afib (Intent: History). I took the Pfizer vaccine.&#34; I am scheduled to get the second dose on the 18th and I am concern about the elevation of my heart rate and elevation of my blood pressure.&#34; Outcome of event &#39;tired&#39; was recovered in 2021; &#39;Blood pressure raised&#39; was unknown; &#39;Heart rate increased&#39; was not recovered; &#39;feel very weak&#39; was unknown; &#39;I think I had a reaction to it&#39; was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Male patient who to the hospital on 3/15/2021 due to 10 days of shortness of breath on exertion and right-sided chest pain.   He went to his PCP for follow-up and had a CT PE study today which was positive for right upper lobe and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism.  He notes that he received a 2nd 5 0 COVID-19 vaccination on March 6th and since then has not felt well, feeling short of breath and generally fatigued.  He notes that he has not been very active since receiving the vaccine.   CT PE study showed an increased RV to LV ratio 1.2.  He had no elevation in his troponin or BNP.  His echocardiogram showed an EF of 60% and there were no wall motion abnormalities and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient would prefer Eliquis at this time.  He will need a 6 month course of Eliquis.  Given the setting of recent COVID vaccination and recent decreased mobility as possible provoking factors, this will be treated as a provoked pulmonary embolus.  Per hospital COVID vaccine protocol, patient presentation will be reported to pharmacy for FDA reporting.

Patient drove himself to the hospital for evaluation and treatment on Saturday, March 27th where he collapsed in cardiac arrest. he was resuscitated and stabilized on life support. He died of multiple organ failure on Monday March 29th. The official diagnosis was Severe Septic Shock. It is unclear if any infective agent was identified. It should be noted that sepsis is a condition in which immune dysregulation is inherent and includes cytokine storm activity. The possible correlation between vaccination and the subsequent development of sepsis should be investigated.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients (father and mother). This is the first (father) of the two reports.  A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Dose 1) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 26Mar2021 (batch/lot number: ER8727) at 79 years old as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing AFib (atrial fibrillation) diagnosed between 1 and 2 years ago. Patient also has a pacemaker from an unknown date. Patient was exposed to COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) oral from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 5 mg twice a day taken for AFib (atrial fibrillation). On 07Apr2021, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to a fall; he fell in the bathroom and passed out. The patient is on Eliquis, so they were worried about bleeding. He tested positive for COVID on 07Apr2021, this was the same day he was admitted to the hospital. He was discharged on 10Apr2021 and was improving. It was reported that the reporter (patient&#39;s son) tested positive for COVID on 27Mar2021, so it was likely his parents were exposed or infected prior to their first dose of the vaccine. The reporter confirmed he has not been vaccinated. The patient was due to get the second shot today, but the reporter cancelled the appointment since his dad was still in quarantine. The reporter heard different things about when to get the second dose, everyone says to wait 90 days, they&#39;re getting mixed information, then he has heard 3 weeks is long enough to wait. The reporter wanted to know when his dad can get the second dose of the vaccine after having the COVID-19 infection. The patient is recovering from &#34;he fell in the bathroom and passed out.&#34; Outcome of the event &#34;tested positive for Covid&#34; was unknown.   This case involves a Product Complaint: Consumer reported that his father and mother tested positive for Covid infection on 07Apr2021 after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 26Mar2021. It was not provided if a sample of the product was available to be returned, if requested and if packaging was sealed and intact.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021443810 same reporter, same drug, same event, different patient

                                                chest pains; cough; rash; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumer (patient) via Medical information Team.  A 79-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Jan2021 at 14:15 (Lot Number: EL3248) as single dose; dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Feb2021 at 14:30 (Lot Number: EN6201) at the age of 79 years as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medication was not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 05Mar2021 the patient experienced chest pains, and cough, which required hospitalization from 05Mar2021 to 08Mar2021. The patient informed that he had some stress with son and daughter to point where he had some chest pains. After a week or two of conversation involving patients son and granddaughter culminated into this. The patient informed that when he went to the hospital because of chest pains, patient was already use to that and wasn&#39;t worried about it. The patient stated he didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital, called the doctor but because of Covid, the doctor wouldn&#39;t see the patient. The patient stated he shouldn&#39;t have been in the hospital at all. In terms of the cough, he simply called the doctor because the patient wanted cough medicine or something for that, temporary thing coming on. Patient stated the cough did not linger, and it was never treated.  The hospital got into the chest pain and jumped on the heart situation and patient thinks they saw dollar signs or something.  The patient wasn&#39;t very happy with them. The patient informed that he was given a blood thinner, Heparin IV during time hospitalized. The hospital decided to hold the patient over and they gave the patient Heparin IV for a good part of three days. The patient reported that he was discharged on 08Mar2021, and on 10Mar2021 the patient noticed the rash. The patient reporting experiencing rash after receiving both doses of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. The patient was thinking the combination of Plavix and heparin only three weeks after having the Pfizer Covid Vaccine could possibly be a side effect of rash. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rash. The doctor gave the patient Clobetasol Propionate and patient did treat rash with that.  The doctor said to apply for 2 weeks and come in on one week.  It has already improved. The patient mentions that he was also taking Calamine lotion and some spray and they all seem to be working.  Patient didn&#39;t want to keep taking Clobetasol because it is a steroid and he had been using for a month and didn&#39;t want to do that. The clinical outcome of rash was recovering. The clinical outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

No additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 07Apr2021, next day (08Apr2021) he started to have discomfort across his chest like a hernia starting on the left (he started to have chest discomfort, like a hurting across the chest starting on the left and now on the right), after being checked on a medical place he was informed that he has Pleurisy, they did a chest X-ray and then they sent the information to the hospital to have a doctor look at it so he had to wait a half hour. Mentioned they wanted to put him on pain medication but he declined because he was allergic to aspirin and he only took Tylenol. He described the sensation as: a discomfort in his chest (not in the lung) in the bone muscle around the lung, it felt like he has been punched right in the cardiac plexus, now was a minor discomfort that won&#39;t go away. He cancelled his appointment to receive the second dose of the vaccine (due tomorrow) and wanted to know if he should receive the second dose at all. The patient also experienced Chest pain that started on 08May2021, but now it had shifted, and it was more on the right side. First he noticed it on the left then it moved under his sternum and now almost all of it is on the right side. The pain got up to a certain point and then it had stayed the same. Sitting he isn&#39;t feeling it but when he got up out of the chair it was worse. Seemed to be worse when he moved from a relaxed position like getting out of bed. Events of Chest discomfort and Pleurisy resulted in &#34;Physician Office Visit&#34;. Events outcome was not recovered.

My wife was asking  questions but I was  having slow responses. She said I had  glazed stare  and  I was a little off balanced and the ambulance was called but the symptoms had subsided by the time the ambulance got there: Blood pressure - a little elevated; Blood Sugar was fine . At that time could follow finger across eyes (before when symptoms were still there, had not been able . Ambulance left and just said to keep an eye on him at home when I refused to go to hospital. We called the family doctor and she said to go to ER immediately. No return of symptoms since that episode.

                                                Non traumatic insidious stroke right brain leaving left side paralysis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 28Jan2021 13:45 (lot number: EL9262) at 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Concomitant medications included metoprolol, atorvastatin (reported as &#39;atorvasten&#39;), tamsulosin, and clopidogrel (reported as &#39;clopidigrol&#39;), all taken for unspecified indications, start and stop dates were not reported, these medications were received by the patient within 2 weeks of vaccination. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1, administered in arm left on 07Jan2021 13:30 (lot number: EL3246) at 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced non traumatic insidious stroke right brain leaving left side paralysis on 15Feb2021 12:30. The event reported assessed as serious which required hospitalization and resulted to disability. Hospitalization: 28 days. The event resulted to emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received included intensive care unit (ICU) care (1 week) and rehab hospital (3 weeks). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and had been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination (unknown result on an unspecified date). The patient also underwent nasal swab on 22Feb2021 with negative result. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Follow-up information has been requested.

                                                embolic stroke; blood clot; His major issue was speech and wasn&#39;t able to formulate any words; left sided weakness on his leg; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s daughter). A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Mar2021 11:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single dose (at the age of 79-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included transient ischaemic attack (TIA) from 2019 to an unknown date, mild hypertension, idiopathic neuropathy: in the left leg, started in the beginning of the year from 2019, melanoma removed in the 1970s, enlarged prostate, neuropathy, cholesterol and fluid retention. Ongoing concomitant medications included tamsulosin taken for enlarged prostate; gabapentin taken for neuropathy; candesartan taken for hypertension; pravastatin taken for cholesterol; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); and furosemide (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]) taken for fluid retention. The patient has been taking all of his meds for quite some time, over 5 years. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 09Mar2021 10:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient completed the Pfizer COVID vaccine series, the second shot was on 30Mar2021. On 09Apr2021, the patient had an embolic stroke. The patient&#39;s daughter stated that the patient has a history of TIA in 2019 and was concerned. She does not know if it was related. She added it might be that if people have previous risk, there may be some precautions, like to take a full dose of aspirin before, a week before. She sent an e-mail last 05May2021 and hasn&#39;t gotten a response back. The patient went to the ER due to embolic stroke and was in the hospital Friday (09Apr2021) through Wednesday. The patient went to the stroke rehab center for 3 weeks. The daughter clarified that the patient was in the hospital until 14 or 15Apr2021 before being transferred (also reported as 5 or 6 days and in rehab for three weeks). Then was discharged last 06May2021. The patient&#39;s condition seemed to be getting better. His major issue was speech and wasn&#39;t able to formulate any words. He was able to speak now. His rehab would be a lot of neurological rehab and speech therapy. The patient previously had left sided weakness on his leg from some random thing that happened. It didn&#39;t seem to get worse. It really affected his speech and cognition. The patient&#39;s daughter thought that the embolic stroke was related to the Pfizer Covid vaccine and added that thought was in some way but cannot say in what way. She thought that it exacerbated some type of blood clotting. She stated that he never had blood clotting issues before and was the type of person that would take a baby aspirin and get a nose bleed, he was the opposite of a clotter. An MRI in the hospital showed blood clot and stroke. He had blood work but does not know what it showed and presumed he was fine (unknown results). He has never really had any kind of blood work issues and does not know why he was on cholesterol medication. The patient required emergency room visit for embolic stroke.

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 13Feb2021 19:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. Patient age at vaccination was 79 years old. Medical history included ongoing COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), ongoing emphysema, ongoing high blood pressure (he couldn&#39;t say, it has to have been a good 15 years he has had it), ongoing high cholesterol (he had it for over 10 years), ongoing Low red blood cell count (depending on his blood count, they give him either a Vitamin B shot or Procrit), ongoing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Both of his parents had type 2 diabetes, and he had type 2 diabetes. Historical vaccine included 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Lot no: EL9263) on 25Jan2021 at 19:00 in left arm for COVID-19 Immunization and flu shot back on October for immunization.

He was taking 5mg then they changed it to 10mg about a month ago. He had taken it for maybe 1 and a half to 2 years); epoetin alfa (PROCRIT) taken for red blood cell count decreased, he only took it as needed when his count was below 10. He had not taken it in 6 months; losartan taken for high blood pressure, from May2021 and ongoing (It was new, he started it about a month ago); amlodipine taken for high blood pressure from May2021 and ongoing (He had been taking it for about a month); atorvastatin taken for blood cholesterol increased from an unspecified start date and ongoing (He had taken it for a couple years); nintedanib esilate (OFEV) taken for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from an unspecified start date and ongoing (He had been on it for about a year). The patient experienced AFib on an unspecified date with outcome of recovered. His voice was hoarse today (21Jun2021) with outcome of unknown. He stated he spent 4 days in the hospital and got his rhythm back to normal after 2 days. They put him on apixaban (ELIQUIS), which was a blood thinner.

                                                1 significant episode of asymptomatic Supraventricular tachycardia; transient ischemic attack; seizure-like shaking; shaking episode arms going up and down; extremely tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient himself). A 79-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration in Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at the age of 79-year-old male as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes type two from 30 years, ongoing hypertension from 15 or 20 years ago, depression from 20 years ago, hyperlipidemia from 15 to 20 years, orthostatic hypertension (had it off and on for years;  but it got bad in the last couple of months), pain and radiculopathy. Concomitant medication included metformin (1000 mg) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing (taking for years); glipizide (4 mg) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing (taking for years); lisinopril (10 mg) taken for hypertension from Mar2021 and ongoing; duloxetine (60 mg) taken for depression and pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing (taking for years); gabapentin (NEURONTIN) taken for radiculopathy, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took flu shot for immunization and took dose 1 of bnt162b2 in Jan2021 for Covid-19 immunization at the age of 79-year-old. Physician was calling regarding the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine. He had a very strange experience; added he was a physician and in reasonable good health. He had mild side effects, not much; the one side effect he did have was one week after the second shot he and his wife both felt extremely tired the whole day from Feb 2021. Physician mentioned that 4-6 weeks after getting the 2nd dose, he had a 3-5 minute episode of seizure-like shaking, shaking episode arms going up and down on 21Mar2021 and that he was just blankly staring and non-responsive. He had no other symptoms to suggest a seizure; no biting; no urination. This episode lasted three to five minutes. During the episode his wife said he was just staring ahead and he was non responsive to his wife who was only six inches away speaking to him. Then he started to vaguely he heard his wife&#39;s voice in the distance and then he woke up and then he was fine. Later that day he was hospitalized, they did a work up and discharged him about 4 days later. While in the hospital he thought he had a Blood work, CAT Scan; MRI; holter monitor; EEG but they were all normal. He had no other complications and the effect completely went away. Adds he was completely recovered when it went away. At discharge they put him baby aspirin, 81mg enteric coated aspirin once daily, and gave him a tentative diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA). This further resulted to being hospitalized for 3 days but his physicians were not able to see anything significant on his MRI, 72 hours EEGs and telemetry tests (everything was normal). However, during his out-patient visit, his physician mentioned that he had 1 significant episode of asymptomatic Supraventricular tachycardia that may be causing the seizure (inconclusive).  They further specified to him that it was not much of a tonic clonic seizure. He also verified that he only had 1 episode of the mentioned event, no other side effects experience and been feeling fine since then. After discharge he had a work up on the outside including a 72 hour EEG; 72 hour holter with the only thing that was abnormal that one run of 3 beat supraventricular tachycardia that was asymptomatic. His doctor put him on Metoprolol 12 mg once daily at night by mouth to help prevent arrhythmias as well as control his blood pressure. He had previously taken lisinopril. He added the only thing he knew that he never had anything like this before in his life.  Patient mentions he was at a good weight now as he lost 40 pounds last year for his daughter&#39;s wedding. He added sometime in the last 6 to 8 months he had severe left side radiculopathy and was taking small dose of gabapentin. He did not remember if it happened before or after the vaccine but he went to see a pain specialist. The medication worked and he tapered it down and discontinued it. It may have been before the vaccine, he is unsure. But the medication worked like a miracle as he had intractable pain down his leg. All events resulted in emergency room. In line with this, he would like to know in relevance to the news of Pfizer releasing a possible booster dose, if there are any reports of anything that may be related to seizure and/or Transient ischemic attack (TIA) of cardiac origin or a like. Extremely tired was reported as non-serious, other events was serious and caused hospital from 21Mar2021 to 24Mar2021. Outcome shaking episode arms going up and down was recovered on 21Mar2021, of extremely tired was recovered in 2021, of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is no reasonable possibility that the events supraventricular tachycardia, seizure, tremor, and transient ischemic attack happening 4-6 weeks after vaccination were related to BNT162b2. It is more likely to be complications of pre-existing conditions of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Advanced age may have been contributory as well.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                heart attack; chest pressure; hardly slept; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife).  An 80-year-old male patient (reported also as 81-years-old, to be clarified) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot # EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 80-years-old. Medical history included ongoing emphysema and ongoing diabetes (caller has been diagnosed for 35 years for both conditions), heart was damaged because of the diabetes, and a history of bypass 4 years ago however he hasn&#39;t had any issues with chest pressure since before the bypass. Concomitant medications were none. On 15Jan2021 at 1:am he developed pressure in the chest which ultimately resolved. This trouble last night, lasted over 1 hour. He couldn&#39;t get back to bed. He had to sleep sitting up on the sofa. That was the only way he was comfortable. Her husband has hardly slept. She was seeing how he was doing. He said he was okay sitting. The pressure on his chest would go away while he was sitting, but laying down it would come back. This morning (15Jan2021) she made him check when he woke up at 8 o&#39;clock. She made him lay down, and he said it was gone after sitting the whole night. He is well now. He is feeling fine. He didn&#39;t even ask for help getting on his clothes. He got the vaccine because of his age and because of underlying conditions. Her husband has done very well this year. He even has underlying conditions. He has had Emphysema for 35 years, but it hasn&#39;t been bothering him. He has also had diabetes for 35 years. The reporter spoke to her husband&#39;s hcp (nurse) who said it could have a heart attack and for him to go to hospital if it reoccurs. She did speak with a nurse with his primary doctor, and she said the pressure in his chest for 1 hour could have been a heart attack. That if it occurs again to give him the nitroglycerin. She told the nurse it wasn&#39;t pain. The reporter stated chest pressure could have been a heart attack. He is scheduled to get the 2nd dose on 21Jan2021. The reporter was wondering if her husband can have the second dose given it has potassium in it (given he has bypass history). The reporter is afraid the vaccine is not safe, and they may not go for the second vaccine. She wants more information if it is safe.  The events recovered on 15Jan2021.

Pt and his son exited the building and when they got to the car, the pt shouted out &#34;oh no!&#34; and collapsed to the ground. The patient was unconscious experiencing agonal respirations, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. There is an Emergency Room at the same location. Their staff came out and helped to transfer the pt to the ED for further evaluation. It was found that the patient had a known  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm (7/28/2017) that seemed to have ruptured. The patient was stabilized and transported to our local hospital and upon arrival, he was effectively comatose with a GCS 3. CT Head notated an extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage most probably related to a bleeding anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Neuro-Interventional Radiologist dictation reads &#34;Hunt Hess 5 Fisher grade 4 extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage and early hydrocephalus secondary to rupture of a known anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  Initial ICP after EVD placement noted to be in the 120s now 68 treatment complicated by aneurysm rerupture after admission and increased volume of blood although large volume of hemorrhage was seen on initial scan and no change in the patient&#39;s clinical exam on her scale was noted due to this rerupture.  Patient&#39;s exam and prognosis are poor giving extensor posturing lack of extraocular movements to doll&#39;s maneuver and weak pupillary reflex as well as cough and gag.  Follows no commands or instructions at this time with no spontaneous movement on ventilator set at 12 overbreathing at 14-16 at this time without any sedation.&#34; The family opted to discontinue any further treatment to include surgical intervention given the findings. The patient was given comfort care with son and daughter at the bedside. The patient was extubated and expired at 1545h on 2/13/2021.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

                                                pulmonary edema; Low heart rate; chest pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. An 80-years-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in left arm on 28Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 Immunisation. Medical history included dementia, high blood pressure, COVID prior vaccination. He had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included diltiazem hydrochloride (CARDIZEM), anastrozole (ARIMIDEX), simvastatin and lorazepam. Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 07Jan2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 Immunization. There was no other vaccine received in four weeks. The patient experienced pulmonary edema, low heart rate and chest pain on 26Feb2021. The events resulted in hospitalization and patient died. The patient was hospitalized from 26Feb2021 for 1 day. Treatment received for the events included Epinephrine, morphine, nitroglycerine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid test Nasal Swab post vaccination on 26Feb2021 indicated Negative. The patient died on 26Feb2021. An autopsy was not performed.  information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pulmonary edema, low heart rate, and chest pain, all reported as fatal, are deemed unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine, being rather accidental occurrences, likely favored by the patient&#39;s age and by the mentioned high blood pressure, known risk factor for  cardiovascular diseases.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Low heart rate; pulmonary edema; chest pain

                                                My Husband and I received the same day a strong pain in our left arms. The next day my husband complained about pain in his entire body and weakness, and I had the same.  In the evening he collapsed falling out of his wheelchair.  He tried for an hour to sit down back in his wheelchair with my help, but he couldn&#39;t.   He agreed that I call 911.  Two nurses took him to Emergency Room at Hospital and didn&#39;t allow me to go with him.  In the morning on Saturday, he was transferred to Room at Hospital and the next day to the Intensive Care Room, where he sadly passed away on Tuesday April 13 at 4:22 am.

Pt presented to hospital on 04/28 w/ complaints of nausea and vomiting. He stated that he had recently gotten his COVID vaccine. Pt was found to be in acute liver failure in the ED w/ AST and ALT &gt; 1000. Lactate &gt; 15.0. BMP showed AKI on CKD and BG &gt;500. Pt did have cardiac arrest while undergoing CT Scan and ROSC was achieved after CPR x 20 mins.  Pt was hence transferred to the ICU for higher level management and admitted for cardiac arrest and acute liver failure.   Upon arrival, Pt was intubated and sedated. He was non-responsive to verbal and physical stimuli. Pt was acidotic. ABG: 6.99 / 28 / 165 / 7. 1 amp of HCO3 was given upon arrival. Pt was started on insulin gtt for DKA and was started on Levophed for low BP.  Pt underwent cardiac arrest shortly after arrival to the ICU. CPR was performed for &gt; 20 mins without ROSC. Family arrived at bedside and decision was made to stop CPR at 0205 on 04/29/2021.

From H&amp;P &#34;He reports that he woke up this morning and then subsequently started developing left-sided chest discomfort, it was pleuritic in nature.  It is sometimes worse with position.  He traveled to the Emergency Room where he was found to be mildly hypoxemic.  He underwent workup to include a CT angiogram, which revealed multiple predominantly small peripheral bilateral pulmonary emboli with borderline dilation of the main pulmonary artery and slightly greater than 1:1 right to left ratio.  He subsequently was felt to be appropriate for admission because of his underlying hypoxemia.  He denies any unilateral weakness or stroke symptoms.  He does have a patent foramen ovale.  He also reports no history of calf discomfort.  With the exception of being sedentary because of the pandemic, he has not traveled anywhere in a car or in a plane in the last 6-12 weeks.&#34; treatment: enoxaparin 1mg/kg SQ Q12h starting 4/25 @1659, changed to apixaban 10 mg PO Q12h 4/26 at 1756.

                                                His blood pressure was up just a bit; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 80-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EN6023) via an unspecified route of administration in the top part of the left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COPD from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, reported as diagnosed 3 to 4 years ago and the patient was not taking any medication for it; and blood pressure from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient reported no family medical history and no adverse events following prior vaccinations. Concomitant medications included atenolol from an unknown date for blood pressure. The patient reported he received his second dose of BNT162B2 on 20Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported he did not have any trouble with the first vaccine and that one other thing had happened, and he was unsure if it had anything to do with it or not. He reported he went back to his doctor and had been taking atenolol for blood pressure at a dose of 50/25; his blood pressure went up just a bit and he could not verify who the girl was that changed it to 100/25; also reporting he didn&#39;t like the way he felt and eliminated it and went back to the previous dose taking two over a period of 2 to 3 days. The atenolol was in a pharmacy vial and he didn&#39;t have the lot or expiration date. The date his blood pressure was up was for the past couple times; further stating it usually was 120/60-70 and then it jumped up to 150/60-70 and that was why it needed to be changed. The patient reported it was filled on 18Mar2021 which was after the first vaccine but before the second dose. The clinical outcome of his blood pressure was up just a bit was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient was in his usual state of health and independent with his ADLs until 2-3 days after his 2nd COVID vaccination on Feb 26th when he began to have bilateral knee and LE pain.  He then was having difficulty walking for a couple of weeks. The leg pain was not constant, but he did fatigue easily with walking.  On 3/11 he had his lower dentures placed and that evening/early morning of 3/12 he apparently fell. Patient does not remember anything about the fall - he cannot recall when he fell, how he fell, or any of his symptoms leading up to the fall.  Patient remembers being on the floor and attempting to get up but was too weak. He has rug burns on his forearms from attempting to get up.  He was hospitalized on 3/13 for dehydration, traumatic rhabdomyolysis, and w/u following fall.  Despite very stable labs prior to 1st dose of vaccination on 2/5/21, following vaccination he has had significant and substained leukocytosis as well as transfusion dependent anemia that has not resolved at the time of the reporting (5/13/21).  He remains at a skilled nursing facility due to debility.

Previous Right MCA stroke from 4/11 was fully worked up. The etiology of this stroke was cryptogenic. TSH from 4/11 was 2.57 and T4 was 0.69.  Hgb A1c on 4/11 was noted to be 5.6%. LDL on 4/11 was noted to be 73. MRI brain 4/11/2021 showed multifocal small acute infarcts in the right cerebral cortical/subcortical and periventricular matter infarcts, favored to be embolic. CTA head and neck from 4/11 showed no evidence of large vessel occlusion. Ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities on 4/12 was negative for DVT. ECHO on 4/12 was positive for PFO with an WF &gt; 55%, mild LVH and no thrombus. He also has an atrial septal aneurysm. Cardiac MRI was negative for thrombus. He was discharged on 4/14 with 30 day Holter monitor to evaluate for AFIB.

A 80-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection,Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included bypass surgery. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Jan2021, the patient experienced headache, minor aches, had a cough, muscles were tightening, could hardly walk, lethargic, chills and heart attack on an unspecified date. Caller states that on 14Jan2021 she and her husband had the 1st Pfizer vaccine dose. 2nd dose was scheduled on 04Feb2021. Caller reporter that 2 days after the 1st dose, her husband&#39;s muscles were tightening, could hardly walk, had a cough, was lethargic, had chills and was c/o having reflux in his chest. Caller stated they had appointments that day with their Internist and their Cardiologist. Both HCPs felt all his symptoms were probably from the vaccine. That night she took him to the ER and he had had a heart attack. They did a cardiac Cath and had one of two stents put in. His kidneys were compromised and the HCP couldn&#39;t give the amount of dye needed to add another stent. So he still needs another stent. Also the blood count went down. Caller states her husband had cardiac bypass surgery years ago. The caller also mentioned her son is a surgeon and had bad flu like symptoms after second shot and only had a headache and minor aches after the first dose. She was concerned about her husband as he had a heart attack and if he should get the 2nd dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood count: went down. Outcome of the events were unknown.  Upon follow-up on 16Apr2021: This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

Treatment team COVID-19 Principal problem Chronic anticoagulation  Persistent atrial fibrillation (CMS/HCC)  COVID-19  Confusion  Hypoxemia Hospital Course: In his hospital stay we managed his medical issues as follows;   Confusion/Syncope in the setting of COVID-19 infection Chronic atrial fibrillation/sinus node dysfunction Hypertension Prediabetes Patient received first dose of vaccination on 3/16 and afterwards started having muscle aches and body pains, later on found out to be having Covid 19&#43; test, he might be having Covid infection before vaccination as well and symptoms showed with vaccination.  On 3/24 he was found out to be having confusion, family called EMS.  They tried to debride patient on his feet and he collapsed for about 10 seconds.  He did mention that he usually get dizziness/lightheadedness upon standing from bed.  Although patient has a history of A. fib but remained rate controlled during hospital stay, we held his antihypertensives including HCTZ and ARBwhile continued his Eliquis.  I believe his syncope was likely due to dehydration with decreased oral intake in the setting of acute illness with COVID-19 symptoms. Before discharge is blood pressure was rising so his ARB were restarted while decision regarding HCTZ will be made by primary care physician. In regard to his COVID-19 infection, initially was started on 2 L of supplemental oxygen but his oxygen demand decreased rapidly and most of the time he remained room air, he was not showing any dyspnea, cough, fever or any other generalized symptoms of Covid 19 infection.  He did get plasma and remdesivir while inpatient, decision was made to discharge him on 3/26 as patient was symptom-free.  He also had received first dose of vaccination. I believe that he would need further remdesivir.  We will continue him on steroids for now after completion of dexamethasone for next 8 days he can recent resume his home medication of prednisone.

An 80-year-old male patient of unspecified age and gender received the first/second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) via intramuscular at left arm on 02Feb2021 10:00 (80-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included Stents from 2005 (a stent placed in 2005; a heart attack in 2017 and additional 5 stents were placed in 2017; a stent placed in his neck in Nov2019); Heart attack from 2017; Reaction to contrast dye from 2005 (has a reaction to the dye that they use for stents; had a stent placed in 2005 and had a reaction to the dye then; a mild heart attack in 2017 and did stents; once again had a reaction to the contrast dye); Sensitivity to bug bites (When the patient got big bites, you would think someone had beat him he had so many knots; the last few years the patient&#39;s reaction to bug bites got much worse); High blood pressure. Additional information for other conditions: The patient was very highly allergic or has a reaction to the dye that they use for stents. The patient had some heart stents and he had bad reactions to the contrast used. The patient was allergic to different things. The patient couldn&#39;t take codeine. When the patient got big bites, you would think someone had beat him he had so many knots. Reaction to contrast dye: the patient&#39;s physicians then wanted to do imaging with contrast dye on the patient&#39;s neck. Physician put the patient on a cocktail for 24-48 hours before the stent was placed and the patient still had a reaction. The patient was given a cocktail of Benadryl and 2 other medications that she cannot remember. The patient&#39;s reaction to the dye was not as bad as the first 2 but he still had one. The patient had the stent placed in his neck in Nov2019. The patient still had a reaction to the contrast dye, a mild reaction, even with the cocktail. The reaction was enough the patient was told to continue taking the medication afterward. The patient always carried a nitro bottle in his pocked but he never took any of them. They asked how the nitro tablets were and they were powder. They were blessed as far as the patient&#39;s heart. Concomitant medications included cetirizine taken for allergy problems; amlodipine taken for high blood pressure for years; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) (for the arteries, just to keep the blood thin, the patient began taking aspirin after experiencing side effects from Effient). The patient previously received codeine and experienced sensitivity (Couldn&#39;t take codeine, goes way back, 40-50 years). The patient previously received prasugrel hydrochloride (EFFIENT) from 2017 and experienced shortness of breath (The patient was put on Effient after his stent placement in 2017. Doctor took the patient off of Effient and instructed him to just take aspirin because the patient was showing side effects of shortness of breath and different things. Doctor informed the patient that he would rather the patient just take Aspirin than have the side effects from Effient). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) at left arm on 12Jan2021 (80-year-old at time of vaccination) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced &#34;so excited&#34; (the patient was so excited after the first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously received tetanus vaccine toxoid (TETANUS) shot for immunisation (20 years ago at least) and experienced &#34;Couldn&#39;t move arm, arm swelled and turned red and was messed up for a while&#34;. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Patient&#39;s wife reported that she and her husband (the patient) took the COVID-19 vaccines on 12Jan2021 and 02Feb2021. After his second dose, the patient kept telling her that he didn&#39;t feel good and that he was tired (from 03Feb2021). The patient just did not feel good. The patient was cold and so cold to the touch (from 03Feb2021). On 03Feb2021, he was dragging. The patient just wanted to stay down and didn&#39;t want to get up. She asked the patient if this was going to keep him in the room all day. The patient replied that he just couldn&#39;t wake up. The patient was tired and cold and couldn&#39;t get warm. The patient lost 30 pounds (in Feb2021) after he got the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient walked around holding his pants up. The patient would eat very little and he didn&#39;t like to eat. When he was weighed at the doctor on Friday 02Apr2021, he weighed 136 pounds fully clothed. The patient normally weighed 150-160 pounds. The patient had lost a lot of weight. The patient&#39;s color was off, stating that one of her friends said the patient looked grey. The patient experienced pressure in lower stomach (in Feb2021). The patient told her that in his lower stomach, he described it as pressure, and the patient thought he was just kind of sore from coughing from the sinus infection. The patient couldn&#39;t stand clothes to touch him and would cut holes in his underwear elastic so that it wouldn&#39;t press into him. The patient went to the doctor twice from the time he took the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine to his death (on 04Apr2021). The patient went to the clinic. The clinic thought the patient had a sinus infection (from 27Mar2021) and gave him a shot that would make him feel good. The patient got a shot on 27Mar2021. She wasn&#39;t sure what the shot was and she didn&#39;t get a print out. They treated the sinus infection with amoxicillin-clavulanate (875mg-125mg, manufacturer is Teun). The amoxicillin hadn&#39;t worked well and the patient went back to the clinic a second time on Friday, 02Apr2021. When the patient went to the doctor on 02Apr2021, they were unable to get a register on the finger pulse-ox monitor. The patient&#39;s physician did an X-ray (on 02Apr2021) and the X-ray was perfectly fine (normal). Nothing showed up on the X-ray at all. The patient passed away easter Sunday morning (04Apr2021). The cause of death listed on the patient&#39;s death certificate is due to consequence or problem of pulmonary embolism (from 04Apr2021), respiratory impairment. The patient did not receive an autopsy. The family didn&#39;t feel the need and the staff didn&#39;t even ask if the family wanted an autopsy. &#34;When you live to be 80 years old, you&#39;re blessed.&#34; HCP: The patient&#39;s heart doctor did not see the patient on 04Apr2021 before he died. The last time the patient saw the doctor was Dec2020. The wife reported that she is not complaining, the patient made the decision to take the shot, she is just concerned that the patient had something that could help someone else. The wife stated she was not trying to complain at all, she took the COVID-19 vaccine right beside him and had no consequences. She didn&#39;t even have a sore arm. The family is just concerned that there is an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccine or something that could trigger that in them. Yesterday, 23Jun2021, they were showing a lady on TV that was so sick (unable to provide details). &#34;The patient&#34; (unknown to which patient this is referring) got the shot and ended up in the hospital with side effects. The wife reported that&#39;s why she wanted to let Pfizer know about her husband. She was just reporting the patient&#39;s symptoms and was not wanting to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings in the world. She is not blaming the COVID-19 vaccine for the patient&#39;s death, and stated that it could have been his heart or more anything. She just felt like she needed to let pfizer know some of the side effects the patient was having that didn&#39;t start until after the second COVID-19 shot. The wife unable to provide the NDC number, lot number, or expiry date of the patient&#39;s COVID-19 vaccines. She does not have the information but her son does have that if Pfizer wanted to call and talk to him. The adverse events did not require a visit to emergency room; the adverse events requiref a visit to physician office (The patient went to the clinic 27Mar2021 and went back 02Apr2021 for Sinus infection). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event sinus infection and included a shot and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The outcome of the event pulmonary embolism/ respiratory impairment was fatal; outcome of other events was unknown. The patient died on 04Apr2021. No autopsy was done. The cause of death was pulmonary embolism/ respiratory impairment.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Pulmonary embolism/ respiratory impairment

                                                Within a few minutes of his 2nd dose, he said his throat felt tight like it was closing. I alerted staff. They checked his blood pressure. 155/50. Made us wait another 20 minutes and my dad said he felt better after drinking water. Once we got home he said he felt brain fog and a bit dizzy. He passed away on May 4th, 2021. 3 days after his 2nd dose of Pfizer. It was ruled a heart attack.

                                                shortness of breath; The shortness of breath has continued and has gotten a little worse; Nasal congestion; Coughing; heaviness in chest; It was like lumps; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer or other non hcp (patient himself). A 80-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 13Feb2021 12:10 (at the age of 80 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Previously the patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 23Jan2021 (at the age of 80 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: 30Apr2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Heart bypass, it was 18 years ago. It was a aortic valve replacement, ongoing lymphoma cancer, and it is gone at this point, had shingles on the right side in 2015, skin cancer in both ears in 2016. Concomitant medications included ongoing warfarin sodium (COUMADIN), ongoing warfarin deanol, ongoing carvedilol, ongoing atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR ORIFARM), ongoing atorvastatin, ongoing hydrochlorothiazide, triamterene (TRIAMTERENE &amp; HCTZ), ongoing gabapentin (GABAPENTIN) taken for restless legs syndrome, ongoing acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), ongoing turmeric and bromelain, ongoing ascorbic acid, betacarotene, cupric oxide, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION) taken for macular hole, ongoing loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM) taken for diarrhoea, ongoing bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius (PROBIOTIC 10), ongoing potassium, ongoing Calcium citrate magnesium zinc all in one pill 80mg Magnesium, 500mg Calcium, 10mg Zinc, 20mg B6 taken for restless legs syndrome. Has been on his normal medications for years and nothing has changed. Has been on all of these medications at least 15 years, or more than that, maybe 18 years. The patient experienced shortness of breath since Feb2021 (at the age of 80 years and 6 monthes). He received both doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine and received his second dose 13Feb2021. He has been to his doctor and has been treated with antibiotics and Prednisone. He wanted to know what he should do about it. Caller&#39;s shortness of breath began a couple of weeks after his second dose in Mar2021, where it became noticeable, and it continues. The patient would like to know if others have reported shortness of breath after receiving the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. He has been experiencing shortness of breath since Feb2021. Maybe it is a side effect of the Covid vaccine, he does not know. First stated that it was around 15Feb2021 or earlier, when he first went to the doctor. He stated that he did start experiencing it before then. He wouldn&#39;t of went to the doctor if he didn&#39;t have that. Wife was brought on the phone to describe the event further. Stated that 01Mar2021 is when he first went to the doctor. They went on vacation on an unspecified date in Mar2021 and his wife had to take him to a clinic there that it was around 09Mar2021. He has had 4 series of antibiotics and prednisone since that first visit in Mar2021. When he got home, he went to the doctor again and they gave him more antibiotics and Prednisone. Then again in May, he had another round of it, and is still experiencing shortness of breath. He had also had other symptoms at that time. He had a lot of congestion. It did not stop but that has kind of subsided. The shortness of breath has remained. He had heard a news report stating shortness of breath symptoms have been reported regarding the COVID vaccine. He had his last shot 13Feb2021, he thinks it was. Soon after, he started having the shortness of breath. At first, he didn&#39;t relate it to the Covid shot. He does have heart problems. The first antibiotic was Azithromycin, it was with the Prednisone, It was the ZPack. He took it for 6 days and then tapered one every day. In Mar 2021 he took Medrol pack, which was 4mg tablets. They were different Prednisones and different antibiotics each time. The last one he took was Doxycycline, which was 40mg and he took it for 4 days. Can&#39;t remember what the other one was. Caller states that he had the Zpack from the clinic and his doctor gave him Doxycycline after he came home. It was a different amount of Prednisone each time. He had a lot of allergy like symptoms with nasal congestion and coughing. States that it was clear congestion and was probably 3 times as thick as with normal nasal problems. It was like lumps, was clear and was coughing it up. The congestion started when he was coughing up stuff. The last time his doctor gave him nasal spray, Azelastine HCI, which was in a spray bottle with 30ml. He stopped it after a period of time. He still has some congestion every day, but it is not near what it was before. The Prednisone and antibiotic lessened the problem along with the nasal spray and really helped. The shortness of breath has continued and has gotten a little worse. He used to be able to walk 3 quarters of a mile every day but now he probably can&#39;t walk 4 blocks. Sometimes, just sitting on the couch, watching TV, he gets heaviness in his chest. He has to breathe really deep to get it fixed. When he had his oxygen level tested, at the doctor&#39;s office, it is always 98, 99 or 100 percent. The doctor listens to his lungs and he doesn&#39;t see or hear anything that is going on. He had an X-ray for his lungs they didn&#39;t see anything there either. Had a chest X-ray, blood tests by his primary care physician and heart doctor. Had blood tests by his oncology doctor. All of those came out normal, with no problems. Feel free to ask for those results. No other additional vaccines were administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient has not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior vaccinations. The adverse event shortness of breath resulted in visit to urgent care and physician office. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the adverse events. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, a possible causal association between the events &#34;Dyspnoea, Nasal congestion ,Cough, Chest discomfort &#34; and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

                                                My 81-year-old father, and my brother received the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at the  Hospital  on Wednesday January 13, 2021. Within a couple of minutes of them returning home, my father collapsed. As it turns out, he&#39;d had a silent heart attack. He is still in the medical center area Hospital this morning. A cardiologist who was filling in for my father&#39;s primary cardiologist thought maybe my father had a blockage and might have needed a stent. But when Dr. performed a cardiac catheterization,  he only found a little plaque. Medical personnel are not too sure what caused the heart attack. My was very dehydrated when he was admitted, and he has underlying health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, dementia and a history of blood clots. Those are just a few of his health issues. His primary cardiologist, Dr is back in town. He plans to see if my father has AFib before they release him. I believe Dr. an internist at Hospital,  said my father&#39;s INR on admitting was 1.2. My father&#39;s hematologist, Dr.,  had told us to let the person administering the vaccine know that my father is on blood thinners. I was not present when my father and brother received the vaccine, but I assume my brother passed that information on to them.

                                                My heart began to skip beats on Friday, the day after the shot, at around 8:20 am.  The skips continued for 3 days , Fri., Sat., &amp; Sun. And finally on  Monday they ceased.  I could feel my heart beat skipping, and by taking my pulse, it would beat 1-2-skip 1-2-skip 1-2-3-4-skip at times it would beat Consecutively for 27-28 beats then revert back to 1-2-skip - 1-2-skip etc.  I did not go to my heart doctor during this time, as I have experienced  Skipped heartbeats  previously , but not for several years, and not as long as they  continued for the 3 days after my shot.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 15Jan2021 18:00 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL3249) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. He did fine right after, his arm wasn&#39;t sore, he felt fine. The next day he had nothing, no soreness, nothing, he felt great the next day. Dizziness started in the morning 17Jan2021 when he got up he said good morning and then said he would bring her back a cup coffee then he became very dizzy and leaned against the wall for support and then he fell, he was okay but he fell. He did go the emergency room because he fell and hit was head and it was bleeding. They told him it was not related to the vaccine but it is one of the things that are on the form that could happen. She says it was okay if it caused it she is just looking for a reason.  Now today (18Jan2021) he feels fine she wants to know what causes that side effect. She says she is supposed to be getting her vaccine too. He had one bad dizzy spell and then it went away, and she thinks he got kind of nauseous with it. It says this can happen, it said it could happen right after but in his case it did not, it happened within probably 34 hours or something. Outcome of the event dizziness has recovered completely at this point. Outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                Stroke; like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283 and expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, intramuscular in left arm on 18Jan2021 13:10 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chicken pox, measles, and mumps (had chicken pox vaccine, measles, and mumps when he was younger, and he got the flu shot for flu). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The next day (19Jan2021) after receiving the injection, patient reported it was like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day. This went on for a couple of days before it improved. There was still a little bit in his left eye, but he can read and it has improved. He can see now and his eyes were improving. He found out that he had a stroke on 28Jan2021. He did not go to the hospital. He does not think the stroke affected anything else. He was supposed to have an MRI sometime this week. He went to the eye doctor and the eye doctor was the one that discovered the stroke and his eye doctor sent the report over to his primary office. He had a vision field test which was how the stroke was diagnosed. He was taking a baby aspirin and he will be put on a blood thinner called Plavix. He has not started Plavix yet, he has to go pick it up. Outcome of the event stroke was unknown while the other events was recovering.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

When I got my doctor&#39;s my blood pressure was high, the top number was 210 I do not remember the bottom now. He said I needed to get over to the ER clinic as soon as possible which is joined to my doctor&#39;s hospital. When I made it to the ER the blood pressure was 240 now. They to put on blood pressure monitoring, EKG. They gave my a chest x-ray. Cat-scan , blood work and gave me something in my IV.  I went home that about 9:30 PM  that night. My blood pressure was 213/99 and started my new medicine Nifedipine 30 MG . The ER Doctor told me to schedule an appointment with my doctor ASAP. The appointment was scheduled for today but was canceled as my doctor&#39;s office still has no power and was rescheduled for Monday the 22nd.  Prior to receiving the vaccine I have no had high blood pressure. I was feeling anxious once I was informed that  my blood pressure was dangerous high.

I called the son later in the day to see how everything was going and the son said that EMS told him all vitals were normal and he did not go with them.  He then told me that his dad and him were having dinner at the time I called and that he felt fine. He also said his dad did not have breakfast that morning which could have contributed to it since he had T2DM.

That evening, he experienced visual disturbances with slightly blurred vision. Not thinking anything of it at the time, the vision cleared, and he continued about their evening/week without telling anyone of his visual disturbances. On Sunday, February 21, he experienced additional visual disturbances including double vision and dizziness, and we had him visit a local ER for evaluation. He was discharged with a diagnosis of dehydration and vertigo. No scans were performed. The visual disturbances cleared up the following week and the only persistent symptom was a slight dizziness. An eye exam was performed on Friday, February 26 with no problems found. An MRI was performed on March 3, and he was diagnosed with the below conditions.   Impression (3/3/2021) 1. Small acute to subacute infarcts in the left splenium of the corpus callosum and parasagittal left occipital lobe. 2. Trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the parasagittal left parietal lobe. 3. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  He was admitted to the hospital and remained there until Saturday, March 6. Follow-up scans and testing were performed with no underlying reason for the stroke being determined. Prior to the stroke, he had been a very active individual with osteoarthritis as is only health complaint. He was not on any prescription medication prior to the stroke. While in the hospital, the tests for high blood pressure, high cholesterol (LDL 92 MG/DL), sugar inadequacies (glucose 93 mg/dl, A1C 5.7%), etc. came back without major concerns. His follow-up CT scans also did not reveal the stroke shown on the MRI. No inquiry was made by any of his doctors or hospital staff as to his COVID vaccination status/dates to even consider the connection. Below are the results of the last CT scans:  Impression (3/4/2021) 1. Age-related volume loss and white matter disease similar to prior exams. 2. Small infarct seen on MRI are not well seen on CT. 3. No acute intracranial abnormality demonstrated on the CT scan.  Impression (3/5/2021) 1. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. No significant change. 2. Periventricular white matter disease is likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

The leg swelled and was also having foot swelling because blood flow wasn&#39;t there. There was no TIA&#39;s no stroke, no heart racing, no sweating, was all pain. Got leg up and kept elevated until they could get to the doctor and get imaging. Patient went Monday 08Mar2021 to see the doctor. Patient was brought to the doctor and was then sent to the imaging place. Radiology read the imaging around 5:15pm on the Monday, 08Mar2021. The radiologist said there was 2.5&#34; blood clot behind the left knee. He had never had a blood clot before. Patient was then sent to the Emergency Room at (Name) Hospital, in (Name) where they live. Was kept there several hours. Did a lot more blood tests. He was immediately put on 10mg ELIQUIS 10mg, once in the morning, and once at night. He is now taking 5mg Eliquis in the morning, and 5mg at night. He has not had any of these problems before the Pfizer shot. The reporter knew that not a lot had been reported. It seemed it should be safe. The correlation and timing having the shot on 23Feb2021 and all of a sudden a week and a half later this happened. It was 10 days later. There was nothing they can do about it. Just continuing with the ELIQUIS, trying to dissolve the blood clot, will be staying on it for 4 to 6 months. It was a pretty big blood clot and were worried about it breaking up and traveling. The patient had no other symptoms, had a sore arm, that was it. Patient going back to (Name) 01Jun2021 and he will have another CT scan or ultra sound when they get back. The reporter did not want to need to get the leg amputated. Patient was only in the ER, was not admitted to the hospital. Patient was concerned because of his age. If it doesn&#39;t dissolve, they know there will be a lot more trouble. The event of pain left knee, blood clot and sore arm required a visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 on 01Apr2021 (lot number: ER8730) in the right arm. The outcome of events was unknown.

Was probably the lymph node; Was like a very dull irritation in the right side of the neck. Was probably the lymph node.; coughs; very mild sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 81-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm at the age of 81-year-old on 27Mar2021 (Lot Number: EP6955) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cancer from 2018 (started out with BCG treatments, where they insert bacteria into the bladder); Had another form of immunotherapy that didn&#39;t work too well for him and the cancer kept growing chemotherapy; Had a couple of operations and surgeries where the doctor removed it all but it came back. Best reaction was chemotherapy (It stopped the bleeding and was working on the cancer). Last one was 15Feb2021. Was getting blood work for every treatment. Had to miss one of the treatments due to low platelets. Has a chest port for treatments and blood work.  Was very conscious before having chemo. It is kind of a rough thing to kill cancer but also kills good cells too. Definitely worked on killing the cancer for a while; the last treatment was 15Feb2021. Stage 4 was taking chemo. Had bladder cancer (which got out of the bladder and started spreading in to the lymph system), Height: used to be 5&#39;7&#34;, is now maybe 5&#34;4&#34;. The caller remarks that when he started with chemotherapy. he also lost a lot of weight.  Weight: When he went in for last appointment it was 129 or 130 pounds. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took chemotherapy nos from unknown date to 15Feb2021 for cancer. The patient experienced pain in neck and back on 28Mar2021, pain in chest on 29Mar2021. Caller stating that he and his wife had shot number one 27Mar2021 and are scheduled for second shot 20Apr2021. Wife had no symptoms, maybe a bit of a sore arm and he had the same reaction. Was a very mild sore arm in 2021. On day 2 or 3 on the right side of the neck, had felt a little nagging in Mar2021 and slight pain, especially when he moved and felt it around his back. It is just starting to go away now at 3 weeks. Around the back, around the perimeter and when he coughs in Mar2021, he can feel it in his chest. He is scheduled for the second shot. Is wondering if the second shot will have those symptoms. It&#39;s not like it is anything severe, it is just nagging. What worries is him, is that it lasted this long. Is a cancer patient and had last chemotherapy 15Feb2021. His oncologist said to go ahead and take the shot because he really needs the protection. It was asked what if he has the same reaction again. Will go on website but wanted to find out what other people are experiencing and whether or not to take the second shot. Wants to take it for protection. Really wants to take the shot on Tuesday. Pain in neck and back: Only when he coughs, is more of an ache. Started day 2 after vaccine on 28Mar2021. Was like a very dull irritation in the right side of the neck in Mar2021. Was probably the lymph node in Mar2021.  Pain in chest: When he sneezes in Mar2021, there is a sharp pain, all around the perimeter of his chest. Is gone as soon as he stops coughing. Feels when muscles are contracting in Mar2021. Started day 3 after getting the vaccine on 29Mar2021. Stage 4 was taking chemo. Had bladder cancer, which got out of the bladder and started spreading in to the lymph system. Wants to be put on immunotherapy but can&#39;t until he is finished with his shots. If he gets the immunotherapy and if he has a reaction, would have to use steroids and they do not want to do that with the vaccine. The doctor wanted to start him earlier on the immunotherapy but thought it was important to get the vaccine first, that taken care of.  The pain is only sharp if he lifts something. Otherwise, it is just dull. He knows it is there. It is not completely gone. This morning was the best that he had. Really got good sleep last night. The best since it has happened. When he sneezes, he can kind of feel it around his chest, just around the perimeter of the muscles. Treatment: The first couple of days, just put up with it. Took Tylenol one day and then on another day. Takes at bedtime. Does not like taking Tylenol because it effects his liver. If he doesn&#39;t need it, he doesn&#39;t take it. In the last week, every night he has been less and less bothered by how he slept. Last night he didn&#39;t even know he had it, the pain, and slept really well. Have not taken any meds, just Tylenol on day 4 and 5 to help sleep. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of events very mild sore arm, sneezes and feels when muscles are contracting was unknown. The outcome of other events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Instead patient called ambulance to home the next morning and was transferred to the local hospital. Chief complaint chest pain and difficulty breathing.  Bloodwork ruled out myocardial infarction.  Various other assessments done over the first three days of hospitalization, including a CT scan which purportedly showed about a pulmonary emboli.  Most (if not all) of the emboli were in the right lung and were small and fixed/immobile.  At least one was larger.   Patient was started on heparin .  Echocardiogram workup ruled out presence of DVT in the legs.  Patient was discharged after 13-14 days in the hospital.

An 82-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021, 13:00PM (at 82 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated in the Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included myeloid leukaemia (CML) diagnosed a few months earlier, WBCs abnormal, blood pressure, and heart surgery valve repair. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, vitamin d nos, dasatinib monohydrate (SPRYCEL) from an unknown date to help get WBCs back in normal range; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12), and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), all were received within 2 weeks of vaccination. At 82 years old, the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination and did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2. It was unknown if patient was tested for COVID post vaccination. On Friday (unknown date in Feb2021), patient&#39;s WBC was 150,000 and on Saturday (unknown date in Feb2021), patient had bilateral blood clots in legs that then went to lungs then went into BLAST crisis. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care as well as hospitalization due to life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the events). The patient was hospitalized for 12 days. Therapeutic measures which include steroids, blood thinners, and lots of other meds were administered. Outcome of the events &#34;patient&#39;s WBC was 150,000&#34; and &#34;bilateral blood clots in legs that then went to lungs then went into BLAST crisis&#34; was recovering.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose, lot number and expiration date unknown, via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was admitted with pulmonary embolism and Covid 19 PCR positive (Igg also positive) with chest x-ray consistent with Covid pneumonia, 2 weeks after the 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject product contributed to the events. The reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.  Pulmonary embolism is known to be a potential complication of COVID 19 infection, including COVID 19 associated pneumonia.   There is limited information provided in this report. Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including pulmonary angiogram, VQ scan and coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; Cardiomyopathy; Mixed hyperlipidemia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer reported the same events for himself and two other patients. This is the first of three cases.   An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose on 04Mar2021 and first dose on 27Jan2021 (batch/lot numbers not reported); both via unspecified routes of administration as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medications were not specified and reported that they were too many to list, also he has quite a list of prescription. The patient stated since he has gotten both COVID shots and it was found out after going to the doctor and to a cardiologist that he was the third person that has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation from taking the COVID shots and since he was the third person that they had recently after both shots, he thought he should call the toll number and report side effects after taking the vaccine. Consumer confirmed the date for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation as 08Mar2021 and stated primary care doctor, he went for his quarterly visit and she gave him an EKG and it showed this the fibrillation and he was immediately sent to a cardiologist who confirmed it after a second EKG and echocardiogram had both of those. Consumer stated it said atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy and mixed hyperlipidemia whatever that was, he has a print out of the diagnosis from the cardiologist in his hand. Consumer stated date of test was yesterday, 08Mar2021. Consumer stated he was given a new medicine Eliquis 5 mg twice a day as treatment. Consumer stated he just wanted to report this, since the doctor yesterday told him that he was the third patient that had both shots and came back with this. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                After my father received the second COVID vaccination he started complaining of headaches.   He had lung cancer, but he was in good condition.   Within weeks his health deteriorated and when we bought him for a scan the beginning of March he had two small brain bleeds.   The cancer had spread to the brain and he had a mass.    They put a shunt in on March 18th because they said he had fluid, and this was the only treatment.   Ten days later he was back in the hospital and after a week we had to take him home on hospice.   I think the vaccine could of escalated his cancer this rapidly.  Especially because he had two brain bleeds.

ER work-up concerning for severe sepsis with acute hypoxic respiratory failure for which he was admitted to the PCU under the hospitalist service.   Hospital Course He was treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir but remained hypoxic requiring alternating trials of high flow nasal cannula and BiPAP for which pulmonology was consulted on 5/12.  Unfortunately, he did not tolerate prone positioning.  Despite his advanced age and several risk factors, he slowly but surely progressed from a pulmonary standpoint.  He was weaned off high flow oxygen 2 days ago and deemed stable for downgrade to MedSurg with telemetry at that time.  Since then he has continued to recover well, now requiring 6 L of oxygen with activity and 4 L at all other times.  He is anxious to be discharged home and appears medically stable to do so with home health care services, remote patient monitoring and outpatient pulmonology follow-up with PAL as prior to hospitalization.  Prior to discharge, all questions were answered and patient and his son expressed understanding, appreciation and agreement with the discharge plan at this time.   Treatments: IV hydration, analgesia: acetaminophen, cardiac meds: metoprolol, furosemide and aldactone, anticoagulation: eliquis, steroids: dexamethasone, respiratory therapy: O2 and remdesivir

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A male patient of an unspecified age received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dementia and he shrunk he is 5&#39;9&#34; or 5&#39;8&#34;. Concomitant medication(s) included warfarin sodium (COUMADIN), at 4 mg once daily in the evening 6 days per week, On Fridays he takes 6 mg once in the evening. Patient&#39;s wife says her husband had one vaccination, the Pfizer vaccine and a week later her ended up in the hospital. They had to postpone his second dose because he ended up in the hospital but they have the second one coming up on the 14May2021 and she is scared for him to get it, he is adamant he is going to take it. He was taking her to the doctor for a problem she had and he told her he could not go to the bathroom and she was like what, because he has a stoma bag and she looked and it was plugged with a blood clot, he couldn&#39;t open it and drain it so she told him to get in the shower and take it off and put a new one on and she was pulling it off, it was full of blood and there was a big huge, like real liver sized clot came out of his stoma bag. She went to get the stoma bag after the thing came off she grabbed it and got it in the bag and took it out. He was taken to the hospital by the paramedics and he spent 3 days in the hospital. He is 83 now but this happened the week before his birthday, he was 82 when they noticed the blood in his stoma bad, he was a week away from 83. She provides his height and says he shrunk he is 5&#39;9&#34; or 5&#39;8&#34;. She does not remember the date of the first dose. She says his birthday was 18Apr2021. She thinks he was admitted to the hospital on 12Apr2021 and he got the first dose the week before that. She thinks it was 12Apr2021 that he was admitted because it was just before birthday first dose week prior to that. They never made the connection. She thinks he ended up in the hospital on a Tuesday and she is trying to count from his birthday 18Apr2021, she thinks he got to come home on Thursday, 15Apr2021. She believes he went in on 12Apr2021 and was discharged on 15Apr2021, he was there 3 days. No further information provided. Her husband is not there with her. She does not have his vaccine card to provide NDC lot expiration or dose amount. he may not even have his vaccine card because he has dementia. No further information provided.  He hardly takes any mediation He takes Coumadin he takes 1 per day except Fridays he takes 2, she thinks it&#39;s 4 mg and he takes 2 at night everyday except Friday he takes 3. she was guessing. She has one there called Atorvastatin that says it is for Lipitor, so that is not it. She sees Glipizide. No further information provided. She says she found the Coumadin, they are 2mg tablets and he takes 2 at night. She says the dose is not written on there because they call him every 3 weeks because he has to have a blood draw. He takes 2 tablets at night 6 days per week. She clarifies he takes 4 mg once daily in the evening 6 days per week and on Friday he takes 6 mg once in the evening.  They just got report for that and it was 1.8 which is a little bit low but he lost blood and had to have a transfusion while in the hospital. It is in a white plastic bottle they got it from (Name). NDC 0093-1713-01 she does not see anything else. She thinks the pharmacy label is wrapped almost all the way around the bottle but she does not see lot number expiration. She sees they ordered it 11Feb2021 and she has a quantity that is it. Treatment received and outcome was unknown. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

COVID-19 was likely due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and epistaxis and dyspnea was likely a clinical cascade from COVID infection in setting of underlying PAH in this elderly 82-year-old patient.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (07Apr2021): New information received by Pfizer via United Therapeutics (MFR report #: UNT-2021-004686) from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife) includes: suspect product details (new dosing regimen for treprostinil sodium (TYVASO)), new event (breathing issues) and clinical course details.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (19May2021): This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported COVID- 19 positive with mild infection, which is considered failure of COVID-19 vaccine BNT162B2, and the administration of BNT162B2 vaccine. The Company considers the reported events Nosebleed  and Breathing issues  as  unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine,  more likely being inter-current medical conditions.

This is report 1 of 2.   An 82-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EN6208; NDC/expiration: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered at arm right on 22Mar2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 82-years-old) as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed many years ago, ongoing high cholesterol which was diagnosed around the same that his high blood pressure, ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed when he was in his 20&#39;s and he does not take any medications for his type 2 diabetes. The patient did not receive other products. No investigation assessment was reported. He stated several family members had the Moderna Covid vaccine, and they had some negative reactions. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine) and no adverse events were reported following prior vaccinations. Family medical history relevant to adverse event was not provided. His other family members had flu like symptoms, and they were all females. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR); losartan (LOSARTAN); propranolol; primidone (MYSOLINE) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN (E.C.)) all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. He had been taking the same medications for years and never had any negative reactions. Patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot: EN6200; expiry date: unknown), via unspecified route of administration, administered on right arm on 01Mar2021 at 10:00 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced terrible reaction 3 weeks after the second vaccine. He woke up in the morning, turned on light and saw that he had rash all over his body (except for face), like measles, on his back, arms, and legs, intense itching all over body, worse itching he ever experienced in his life on 11Apr2021. The itching was so bad that he scratched himself to the point of drawing blood. He thought he was having a stroke. When he went to urgent care, he was treated with 2 injections Benadryl and steroid (Lot or expiration date was unknown). He was also treated with Pepcid. The injections did not help his symptoms. In the urgent care they didn&#39;t knew what the rash was and later clarified that they called it dermatitis. He stated that the staff did not thought that it was not related to the vaccine. He reclarified that when he was at urgent care, the staff told him that he should feel better in the evening, but by midnight, he decided to go to the emergency room. In the emergency room, he was given Tagamet, Hydroxyzine, and Prednisone. The rash went away and reported that itching was present, but not as bad as it was before. He reported that he took Hydroxyzine as prescribed, and after about 20 minutes, his itching diminishes but then in the evening he started to itch again. Later in the report it was mentioned that for some days he only has to take it once a day and sometimes he can skip a day when he was not itching. He was treated and released from the emergency room. The patient went to dermatologist and neurologist and no one could tell him why he had itching, no one had come up with a treatment as he was still itching. The patient stated that he called because he was reading information about the side effects and learned that the vaccine may cause a rash. Relevant tests were reported as none. Device date was reported as 22Jun2021. The outcome of the rash was recovered completely in 2021, for scratch and pruritus was not resolved and for stroke and dermatitis was unknown.

The injection site was tender but no erythema. I have not had an episode of epistaxis in over a year.  Will be given 2nd dose on Teusday 3/16,21.

                                                Cardiac arrest Narrative:  An 82 year old, male, resident of a facility, received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12/30/20 (time of dose not known). On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name. Breathing was noted to be labored, and nurse was unable to detect a pulse. At 1509, 911 was called and CPR initiated. Spontaneous pulse and breathes resumed just before ambulance arrived at 1522. On arrival at the ED patient was responsive and breathing spontaneously, however, hemodynamically unstable. Patient went into cardiac arrest and code blue called at 1535. Received treatment with epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, amiodarone, atropine. Patient was intubated. EKG obtained and showed acute MI. At 1622 he again went into cardiac arrest and time of death was called.

Patient was admitted to facility on 7/12/20 after he was found down in his home for 3 days, dx with right MCA ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion. Etiology of CVA was presumed to be secondary to AF/warfarin failure. No treatment with tPA or thrombectomy was initiated as he was outside the window for intervention. Patient was also found to have bilateral DVTs. Patient was then admitted to facility 08/14/20 for end of life care.

An 83-year-old male (also age at vaccination) patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right (reported as Right upper arm) on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported that &#34;I have had one stent and one angioplasty done. Stent was done last year in 2020 and angioplasty was done in &#39;1990&#39; (not confirmed).&#34; The patient also added &#34;I gained a bunch of weight when I had my thyroid removed.&#34; The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date for Covid-19 immunization. For the concomitant medication the patient stated, &#34;Yes, I am taking medications.&#34; (specified medications not reported/ provided). It was reported by the patient that, &#34;I got this, my second COVID-19 Vaccine shot Saturday morning. All day Saturday (27Feb2021), all day Sunday and most of Monday, I was so sick, I didn&#39;t realize what was going on. Yesterday (02Mar2021), I ended up in the emergency room because I was having some problems with chest pain. So, I presume this is all connected to the second shot I got.&#34; It was added by the patient, &#34;I am asking question. About an hour or less than an hour ago I woke up, and my whole body felt like it was itching. I mean my whole body was just feeling funny. I was itching all over, that went away, I took a pill a while ago for that. &#39;Lorazepam&#39; (not confirmed over the call), it&#39;s a nerve, anxiety pill and it kind of helped. But right now, my feet are numb and cold.&#34; For the laboratory test the patient stated that, &#34;Yes they did a lab test on me yesterday (02Mar2021) as I went to the emergency room with some heart problems. They did blood work, that&#39;s all they did.&#34; The patient reported for the results, &#34;They said everything was fine.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient explained that &#34;No, I didn&#39;t take any medication for that.&#34; However treatment was received for Whole body felt like itching, whole body was just feeling funny.

                                                Immune thrombocytopenic purpura; ITP; acute bleeding and thrombocytopenia; uncontrollable bleeding that did not stop; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored. A contactable physician (anesthesiologist) reported that an 83-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Mar2021, the patient developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after getting or receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The physician would like to know the protocol of that. The patient got his vaccination, on Thursday before the reporting (25Mar2021). And the patient was admitted to the hospital 48 hours later on Saturday (27Mar2021) with acute bleeding and thrombocytopenia. The patient went to the hospital with uncontrollable bleeding that did not stop. The physician was interested if the company had any internal protocol for treatment of ITP occurring acute onset after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The physician was trying to get some information to help some rheumatologist who can&#39;t seem to be finding things on the information on treating this. The physician was not here to blame anybody for it and from what he/she read, there are like 150 cases around the world with thrombocytopenia after the COVID-19 vaccine from totally different manufacturers (further clarification unknown). The physician had read a many couple case reports of different individual, people have tried for that but he/she was just interested if the company had any inhouse information for the treatment protocols for acute thrombocytopenia after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product BNT162B2 and the reported event Immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

An 83-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), intramuscular administered on arm left on 08Feb2021 08:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269; Expiration Date: 02Feb2021) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation (AFib) and he had maybe once or twice a week but never felt it (before Pfizer shot), ongoing hypertension, and Meniere&#39;s disease which had attacks several times a year  and since he lost his hearing in his right ear the attacks were minor (he felt a little nauseous, similar to having a minor hang over and with a louder than normal ringing in his right ear -tinnitus). Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for atrial fibrillation from 2016 (reported as 5 years ago) and ongoing; and hydrochlorothiazide (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) taken for hypertension from 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) and ongoing. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Before the shots, he had an AFib attack maybe once or twice a week never felt it. He mentioned that the only way he knew he had it was using his fitness watch and take his pulse before several times a day (unknown results) and before he exercise (he will not exercise if he was in Afib  but it always went away overnight). His doctor recommends staying hydrated and will see a cardiologist if it does not stabilize. After his first vaccine shot on 21Jan2021  06:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EK9231) intramuscular administered on arm left and while he was at his car, the was in Afib which lasted for 5 days (26Jan2021) which was unprecedented. After about five days, his pulse stabilized and was back to normal having AFib again maybe only once a week (AER 2021194945). Then, the patient received the 2nd dose on 08Feb2021.  By 08:45, the patient was in AFib again for five days (13Feb2021) when it cleared but then it came back almost immediately for another two days and he was not back to normal even after 7 days. The patient also had Meniere&#39;s attack the same time (08Feb2021 08:45) with the Afib he had. He was little lightheaded and get winded very easily during that time and recovered by 13Feb2021 (same time with the Afib). The event of Afib noted on 08Feb2021 was persistent/Significant disability/Incapacity and did not received any treatment.   No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Uncomplicated alcohol dependence (HCC) 05/05/2021 Yes   Resolved Hospital Problems No resolved problems to display.   CONSULTS: None    INPATIENT PROCEDURES: None   DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY:   PRESENTING PROBLEM: Patient is a 83 y.o. male with Hx of HTN who presents today with complaint of right sided flank pain, with radiations into the right side of his back and right side of his chest. The pain is worse with movement and deep inspiration. He denies palpitations and shortness of breath. He has no previous HX of VTE. He denies fever, chills, cough, nasal congestion, and sore throat. He denies abdominal pain, N/V, and changes in bowel movements. The patient is a limited historian. He is oriented x4 on admission, but states that he has had difficulty with his memory over the past 2-3 years. He lives alone in an apartment.   In the emergency department the patient&#39;s vital signs were stable.  Labs revealed a potassium of 3.3.  AST was 52 and ALT 61. White blood cell count was 11.13.  Troponin was negative and BNP was within normal limits.  Lactic acid was 1.5.  UA showed trace blood.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with PACs.  CTA the thorax abdomen and pelvis showed acute pulmonary emboli involving the segmental subsegmental arteries of the upper and lower lobes.  There is no evidence of heart strain. He was admitted for observation due to severe pain, and was given IV fentanyl.  Echocardiogram showed: The left ventricular ejection fraction is 67%. No regional wall motion abnormalities noted. The right ventricular size, thickness, and function are normal. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 36 mmHg. The inferior vena cava was not visualized during the exam. There is no comparison study available.    He was started on Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, than 5 mg bid for total of 3 months.  He should follow up with PCP in 1 week and should check CBC and BMP on 5/10/21. He should also follow up with pulmonologist in 2-3 months.  He had Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 2/18/21 and 3/18/21. There is remote possibility that this PE could be related to COVID-19 vaccine, so this was reported to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). He had mild hypokalemia due to HCTZ, and required K-dur supplement. HCTZ was switched to Maxzide 25/37.5 mg daily. Rechecked K was normal 3.9. BMP should be checked in 1 week. Also he is drinking little bit too much alcohol, 4 alcoholic drinks every night. He was instructed to cut alcohol drinking to &lt;/=2 alcoholic drink a day.  His daughter was updated over the phone.

Two weeks after the first shot, his right shoulder started hurting also, worst distal to the glenohumeral fossa without radiation, also aggravated with abduction beyond 90 degrees.  Some soft tissue swelling was noted around the hand.   Simvastatin was discontinued with no improvement in symptoms.  Labs showed a sed rate of 54 mm/hr and C-reactive protein of 46 mg/L.  Blood cultures were drawn which were negative, suggesting no evidence of osteomyelitis flare.  He was started on prednisone 15 mg PO daily on 4/5/2021 with rapid and dramatic improvement in symptoms.  Presumptive diagnosis is polymyalgia rheumatica, but he had no previous history of same, and onset of symptoms was remarkably close to the immunizations.

Does not have a regular physician.  Did not tell me initially.  Claims to not have had any for past ten days.  Symptoms did not seem to be worse after second dose, but I can&#39;t be sure.

                                                Hemoglobin has dropped; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife) via the Pfizer-sponsored program. An 84-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 28May2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EW0172) as DOSE 2, SINGLE; and dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 07May2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EW0172) as DOSE 1, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cardiac congestive heart failure from Feb2020 and ongoing; quadruple bypass surgery 35 years ago, had low hemoglobin that was stabilized after receiving RETACRIT infusions, internal haemorrhage and anaemia. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Retacrit Epoetin Alfa [epoetin alfa epbx] since Mar2021 for low hemoglobin, internal haemorrhage and anaemia. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior covid-19 vaccine. It was reported that the vaccine doses were given on 07May2021 and 28May2021. It was mentioned that prior to vaccination the patient had low hemoglobin that had stabilized after receiving RETACRIT infusions. After vaccination, his hemoglobin has dropped and he needed RETACRIT infusions again. The reporter wanted to know if this happened to anyone else. The patient has had a problem with his hemoglobin levels ever since he got both COVID-19 Vaccine doses. The patient was getting infusions (RETACRIT) prior to the COVID-19 vaccine doses. It was mentioned that he did not have any infusions for 8 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine doses. The patient&#39;s hemoglobin dropped after getting both COVID-19 vaccine doses in Jun2021. The reporter (patient&#39;s wife) asked if her husband&#39;s hemoglobin dropping was a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine. Her husband received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 07May2021 and his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 28May2021. The reporter mentioned that she and her husband (patient) was originally not going to get the COVID-19 vaccine because they both react to so many things. Their doctor told them if they got the COVID-19 virus, they wouldn&#39;t survive, so she and her husband got the COVID-19 vaccine. It was clarified that the patient had been getting a clear liquid injected (called Retacrit Epoetin Alfa) into his arm every week since Mar2021. The patient was taking the Retacrit Epoetin Alfa for some internal bleeding, and anemia. After 8 weeks of taking the Retacrit Epoetin Alfa, her husband&#39;s hemoglobin was at a safe level. When her husband received both COVID-19 Vaccine doses, his hemoglobin dropped afterwards. Her husband had to go back to getting weekly Retacrit Epoetin Alfa shots. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of hemoglobin has dropped wherein patient restarted weekly Retacrit Epoetin Alfa shots in Jun2021, providing treatment dates: 07Jun2021, 14Jun2021, 21Jun2021, 28Jun2021, and 12Jul2021. The patient&#39;s hemoglobin level was 11.8 when quit getting his Retacrit Epoetin Alfa shots (in Apr2021). His hemoglobin level then dropped to 10.5 in Jun2021. It was clarified that his recent hemoglobin levels were 10.7 on 14Jun2021 and 10.5 on 21Jun2021. The event resulted to physician office visit. The outcome of the &#34;Hemoglobin has dropped&#34; was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

An 85-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included epilepsy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Caller says her father in law hasn&#39;t had seizure in years, it was diagnosed when he was a kid, 60-70 years ago).  There were no concomitant medications.  The reporter is calling on behalf of her father in law. She said he had his first dose of the COVID vaccine recently, she pulled this number off of the paperwork today. She says that she believes he had a side effect for it, and also he was rescheduled for his second dose. She says his second dose was supposed to be in 21 days but they rescheduled him for it at 18 days instead. She says he got the first dose on 11Jan, and they rescheduled his next for the 29th. She says she wanted to know if this was correct or ok. The reporter says that the following day he ended up having massive diarrhea, that it caused him while he was on the commode to pass out and he fell and hit his face, the best she can tell he was alone at the time. She says he did not go to the hospital for that, he got up and cleaned himself off and took a nap, and the nurse next door checked on him later on. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Heart stopped; Could not swallow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s wife). An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

                                                No adverse effects for the first two weeks.  The morning of 2/7/21 he claimed he was not able to sleep the night before.  He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                85 year old male who presents with 2 episodes loose black stools, weakness, decreased appetite, increased lethargy and subjective fever today, 02/22.  Again admitted and had further rheumatological and infectious work up with negative results  He was initially admitted to Hospital on 02/12 with fatigue, atypical chest pain, melena. He had received 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02/10. He was hospitalized from 02/12-02/15 and  thought to have viral pericarditis.  Diagnosis at discharge: SIRS DUE TO NONINFECTIOUS PROCESS W ACUTE ORGAN DYSFUNCTION.   He was started on celebrex in addition to the the colchicine as an anti-inflammatory.  After initiation of the anti inflammatory medications, patient&#39;s fever resolved, he started feeling better and his inflammatory markers decreased.  He was monitored for another days and was feeling better.  He is therefore being discharged home.  In view of the negative work up, there is suspicion that these may be a hyper inflammatory response to the COVID vaccine since his symptoms were temporally related.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

An 85-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in right arm, on 05Mar2021 12:30 (at the age of 85-year-old), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, atrial fibrillation (AFib), congestive heart failure (CHF), blood pressure high (HBP) and obesity. Patient had no known allergies. No other vaccine in four weeks, no COVID prior vaccination. Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban (XARELTO), lisinopril, metoprolol, metformin, and atorvastatin calcium (ATORVASTIN). The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in right arm, on 12Feb2021 11:30  (at the age of 85-year-old), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. On 01Apr2021, the patient experienced &#34;platelet count of 14,000/ low as 7,000 and high as 30,000&#34;. On 01Apr2021, patient had routine 3 month blood work done for follow up doctor visit. On 02Apr2021, results revealed platelet count of 14,000, doctor called and said to go to ER (platelet count was 77,000 in Jan2021). Patient was still in hospital as of 20Apr2021 in declining condition despite multiple doses of immunoglobulins (IVIG), prednisone, romiplostim (NPLATE), and platelet infusions. Patient&#39;s platelet had been as low as 7,000 and high as 30,000 during his time in the hospital. Events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Patient was hospitalized for 18 days. No COVID tested post vaccination. Other medications reported as glipizide, ergocalciferol (VIT D), furosemide, potassium chloride ER. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

An 85-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 09Feb2021 (Lot Number: EM9810) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2, at the age of 85-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 20Jan2021 (lot number: EL3302) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and experienced Vertigo, felt peculiar, nausea, dizziness/swimmy headed. The patient previously received the flu shot for immunization and experienced Sore arm. He is 85 and not familiar with all the goings on today but heard a report the other day and did not know there was such a thing as Vertigo. He thought that was just a movie. When he took the shot at (place name) in (county name) on 20Jan2021, soon thereafter, not that day but maybe next, he felt peculiar. It was just uneasiness and he did not feel right. That went on and on 09Feb2021, he got second shot and he got swimmy headed, but it has continued on since then and probably gotten worse, especially when he gets up in the morning. He has to hold on until he gets balanced or coordinated. It just doesn&#39;t seem right After he gets up and gets going, it is not as prevalent. But then sometimes it strikes him and he is just completely out of it. He later stated the peculiar feeling and swimmy headedness started the same day as the first injection, but he just did not really pay attention to it and thought it was just one of those things that you accept with getting older. Wife and he both went and he thought his feelings were merely from excitement or depletion or exhaustion. He felt like he had weakness and he just felt different. He got it at noon and waited for 15 minutes. Because of the events around him at the time, it did not register with him because it was the stress of driving 30 miles through expressway. Old people aren&#39;t used to driving that far. It got worse after the second shot and then he really knew something was wrong. When you are old, you have these feelings and pains and aches and all that stuff, and you just accept it as being old. It did not register with him until a couple of weeks ago when he heard it on TV about Vertigo and he said that is what he has. The swimmy headedness was really more noticeable after second shot, it brought it on stronger. He does not complain about things and thought it may just be getting old. He said it just kept on and getting a little worse and worse. Then he said something is not right and one day he bent over to look up and almost blacked out because of sensation in equilibrium or vision or whatever. He got scared and that was a couple of weeks ago. (name) was not cognizant of what was going on until he heard on television about Vertigo. One of the news channel mentioned or somebody mentioned it. It was just general things. He confirmed it was regarding someone who had gotten Vertigo after getting the vaccine but did not have a particular person to report on. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required. The outcome of the event dizziness aggravated and Weakness was not recovered, other events was unknown.

An 85-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose at the age of 85-years-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 15Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus, cancer removed from his buttocks (It was either a basal or a squamous and they did not feel it was bad and they had removed it all) on an unspecified date, he has had a stent put in on an unknown date, Had surgery for a valve replacement on an unknown date, heart disorder (He is on a lot of medications) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 85-years-old on 24Feb2021 and experienced he was tired a little bit. After the second dose on 15Mar2021 her husband and her were extremely exhausted, not sleepy, just tired. They were told to expect that though. He was extremely exhausted and this began soon after the COVID vaccine fairly early in the day. Her and her husband came home soon afterwards and looked at each other and said that they were tired and it was not sleepiness, it was not like they needed a nap. It was profound tiredness and exhaustion. Her husband had it more so but they were both in bed for a couple hours. Neither had pain in the injection site though. This lasted for several hours into the evening. Adds that for her husband 1st dose he did not have any effects basically but for his 2nd dose he did have the weariness, not sleepiness, just a tired feeling for several hours. He was just resting and he was also in the hospital but it was for another event not because of the COVID vaccine. She says that it was frightening, he went to the doctor for a routine check up he has had a stent put in and had surgery for a valve replacement at the beginning of the year and also he has had a cancer removed from his buttocks at the beginning of the year. But during his regular check in they did his hemoglobin and it had dropped to 6.1 on 20May2021, and the doctor said that they were going to call an ambulance and her husband said he was going to drive to the hospital since he was only 2 to 3 minutes from there. They admitted him and he was in for 3 days. They can not find the bleed site and they did an endoscopy and they are waiting for him to have an outpatient colonoscopy. They can not figure out the bleed and where it is coming from. He is currently been resting but it is frightening because it was out of the blue. Caller confirms that the stent, cancer and the valve replacement were all prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was hospitalized for hemoglobin and it had dropped to 6.1 (haemoglobin decreased) and bleed from 20May2021 to 22May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included endoscopy: unknown results on May2021, haemoglobin: 6.1 on 20May2021. The patient recovered from fatigue on 15Mar2021 while the outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021595342 same patient, and vaccine, similar event, first dose

He fell asleep around 2:00 am on 2/26/21 and woke up around 3:00 or 3:15.  He had a drink of water then collapsed.  I performed chest compressions until the EMTs arrived but he was likely dead by the time they arrived.

Prior to this vaccine he was living alone, preparing meals, driving to errands, etc. Over the following few weeks after release he became unable to live at home so he was moved to an assisted living facility where he rapidly declined and was put on hospice less than 2 weeks after his second Covid shot on 3/2/21 (Lot EN9581) (which he only took because his doctor pressured him).  He died on 6/2/21 of heart failure.

                                                The day after the 2nd shot, patient developed blisters on his lips and mouth. The care facility said that he had a nut allergy -- but he had never been allergic to nuts. He stopped eating and drinking and his BP had dropped to 60/40. By Jan 16th they called to say he was dying and he passed away on 1/18/21.  Patient had COVID19 from Oct 29th - early November. By Nov 21st he had lost 40 lbs. He was 6&#39;3&#34; and had gone from 189lbs to 149 lbs with COVID. By Nov 21st when we could visit, he had recovered from COVID, but was very thin and weak. He could not bathroom alone and kept falling.  He didn&#39;t seem to have a bad reaction to the 1st COVID shot, But he immediately reacted to the 2nd shot and passed away within 6 days.

                                                Two nosebleeds; Heart skipped all day long; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 86-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EU9231, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for prevention; apixaban (ELIQUIS), oral from an unspecified date at 2.5 mg twice daily for thromboembolism prophylaxis; and ranolazine (RANEXA), oral from an unspecified date at 500 mg twice daily for an unspecified indication.  Medical history included bypass surgery in 2007, stent placement (5 stents), and 3 blocked arteries, diagnosed several years ago, he guesses he is living on half of them.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient received his first shot of COVID vaccine on 22Jan2021. The patient then experienced two nosebleeds, they did not ask if he had been on a blood thinner, he takes Eliquis, 2.5mg and Ranexa, so his question is a couple days, his heart skips beats anyway, but on the 13th day, it skipped all day long, so he was concerned about the other shot, he was supposed to get it today, he was concerned because he had bypass surgery, had 5 stents, 3 blocked arteries now that they can&#39;t do anything about. He was calling about COVID vaccine. He took it 3 weeks ago today and was supposed to get second shot. Concerned as to whether or not he should take it. He was supposed to get the second shot today (12Feb2021), doesn&#39;t know, but was really concerned about whether he should take or not. Nosebleeds were the 13th day after the shot (on 04Feb2021). He has recovered completely from nosebleeds. He stated he only bled for a couple seconds. Heart skipped all day long the 13th day after taking the shot (on 04Feb2021), states it is doing fine at this time, comes and goes, may skip one day, next day maybe 3 times and skip, then 4 times and skip, he guesses he has a crazy heart. The patient recovered from the event two nosebleeds on unspecified date, while unknown outcome for the remaining event. The action taken in response to the events for apixaban and ranolazine was unknown.   Additional information was also received by Pfizer from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (manufacturer control number: US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY-BMS-2021-016064), license party for Apixaban.   This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of EPISTAXIS (Two nosebleeds) and EXTRASYSTOLES (Heart skipped all day long) in 86-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) tablet for Thromboembolism prophylaxis. CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included ranolazine (Ranexa) tablet for an unknown indication and Covid-19 Vaccine injection for Prevention. The patient&#39;s past medical history included Bypass surgery in 2007, Stent placement and Arterial occlusion. On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (Oral), 2.5 milligram twice a day and Ranexa (Oral), 500 milligram twice a day. On 22-Jan-2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (unknown route) by injection once to left shoulder. On 04-Feb-2021, an unknown time after starting Eliquis, the patient experienced EPISTAXIS (Two nosebleeds) and EXTRASYSTOLES (Heart skipped all day long). The action taken with Eliquis(Oral) was unknown. At the time of the report, EPISTAXIS resolved and EXTRASYSTOLES outcome was unknown. For Eliquis(Oral), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments. Nosebleeds were the 13th day after the shot. He took shot on 22Jan2021. Has recovered completely from nosebleeds. States he only bled for a couple seconds. Heart skipped all day long the 13th day after taking the shot, states it is doing fine at this time, comes and goes, may skip one day, next day maybe 3 times and skip, then 4 times and skip, he guesses he has a crazy heart.

An 86-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 08Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib) and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient was taking loads of medications. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and reported that he had no problems with the first dose. The patient experienced severe left arm pain at the arm where the shot was given on 08Mar2021, the night after he received his second COVID vaccine dose. He almost called a number because he thought he was having a heart attack. What he did was he got up to walk around and the pain went away and when he sat down on his recliner, the pain came back so he didn&#39;t get much sleep that night. He was fine the next day. The patient took an ASPIRIN 325 mg coated pill because he thought he might be having a heart attack. If he had known, he would have taken the vaccine on his right arm. His arm hurt the night of 08Mar2021 until 6:00 AM the following day. The patient then stated that his recommendation was to tell the people who are administering the shot that a left arm pain may possibly occur because anybody who has the left arm hurting is afraid and can think they have a heart attack. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 09Mar2021 at 06:00 AM, and recovered on 09Mar2021 for all other events.

A 86-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included skipped heart beat for which took medication Pacerone 4 years ago. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that he got the COVID-19 virus shot on the 13Jan2021, and about 14 days ago he started having skipped heart beats. He said he had a condition, and took a medication for skipped heart beat that he started taking 4 years ago that when they gave it to him it cured the problem of the skipped heart beat for 4 years. He said after he took the first dose of the vaccine, within 3 hours he could felt the skipped heart beat on 13Jan2021, and he didn&#39;t know if it had to do with it or not, but he was calling to see if anyone else had reported this since the only thing on the paperwork he was given that references the heart was a fast heart beat. The patient reported that the skipped heart beat happened from time to time, every 3-4 hours it might happen, though sometimes it didn&#39;t happen. He said last night it did not happen any and that it was not serious, it was more of an irritating thing. He took medication, Pacerone, cured him in three days, and he only skipped one day of taking it in those 4 years. He already called his doctor and was gonna see him soon, but he wanted to get the second vaccine because he was an attorney and he was in meetings face to face with people, so he wanted to take the second dose which was scheduled on 02Feb2021, The patient said something about 14 days, and he was thinking he would go and take the second dose anyway and see what happens, then thought that might be stupid, but he wanted to take it so bad, but if it caused these heart beats not a good idea possibly. There was product complaint. The patient was unwilling to complete the report. and declined to complete a report. No further details captured, reported, or documented at this time. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested. The lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made.  Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

                                                elevation in blood pressure/hypertension has persisted; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician (patient himself). An 86-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL9266, expiry date: not reported) via unspecified route of administration in left deltoid, on 17Feb2021 13:00 (age at vaccination: 86-year-old) as DOSE 2, SINGLE for Covid-19 immunisation. Patient took first dose of vaccination (Lot: EN5318 or it could be ENS318, expiration date: not reported), via unspecified route of administration in left shoulder in the deltoid on 27Jan2021 13: 00 (age at vaccination: 86) as DOSE 1, SINGLE for Covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history t and concomitant medication were not reported. He was taking a very modest dose of Lisinopril 2.5mg daily, now taking 10mg lisinopril daily.

It was reported that his blood pressure has gone up after receiving the second dose Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine, he doesn&#39;t know if his blood pressuring going up is a coincidence or if this is being seen by other people. Blood pressure has gone up: states 29Apr2021 was when the caller first noticed the hypertension, the blood pressure going up is ongoing and it is the same, states he has increased his anti hypertensive medication so in a sense. Before 29Apr2021 the caller&#39;s blood pressure systolic was below 120, and now the caller is getting ratings like 135, was taking a very modest dose of Lisinopril 2.5mg daily and is now taking 10mg Lisinopril daily. It was also reported that because this spike in protein reacts with the ACE2, the molecule on the surface of the cell spikes protein reactions, which has to do with blood pressure. Patient stated that on 29Apr2021 he noticed an elevation in blood pressure and this hypertension has persisted. He would like to know if this event is a coincidence or if this is a side effect that has been reported with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Patient was inquiring about the length of time the spike protein remains in the body and circulates after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He escalated to secondline for further research. He asked if Pfizer would be interested in obtaining a blood sample from him to see if he still has spike proteins circulating in his system from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after his second dose in Feb. Treatment was given for the adverse events includes Lisinopril 2.5mg daily and is now taking 10mg Lisinopril daily.

A 86-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot number: EN6201 and Expiration date: unknown), via an unknown route of administration on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 86-years-old) as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes and hypertension. The patients concomitant medications included 3 pills one was blood pressure, one for sugar, and one for Potassium correct, he took these 3. Patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EL8982) on 23Jan2021 and on an unknown date felt very weak and walking slow. Reported said he was just calling to report the side effects that happened to my uncle, after he get the Pfizer vaccine. Well, the first weakness was in January and February they did not think too much about it because it was not one of the side effects that were told to watch out for. So, they noticed, my aunt and my cousin noticed that he was having trouble in walking and he used to walking and drive and to the church on regular basis after his first vaccine he had trouble walking and he started moving very slowly that was unlike him and he became very weak. He always has been a walker and that was not normal for him, he was very healthy. So, that was the first injection and then he got the second injection then nobody realized about you know, weakness was none that, no side effects that we talk about, you know from you providers that you read about and what was on the news. So, he got the second injection, and he became weaker and weaker and recently he been using walker now. His weakness got worsen and he could not even move the walker because he could not grip it with his hand. He could not use his hands and it got worse and he has fallen a couple of times, but they did not take him to hospital as he did not want to go to the hospital it was not until 05Apr2021 that he fallen split his head open and he thought he just would go to the ER. He fell couple of times and he finally actually fell and hit his head and was taken to the ER. From the ER he was transferred to the hospital. He was hospitalized and then they could not find anything wrong with him. He first went to the ER on 10Apr2021 at 21:30. Patient was in the hospital for three days on 14Apr2021 they transferred him to a rehab and he was there for 6 weeks and he was sent home on 01Jun2021, but he still could not walk but they sent him home and he could not even move his hand, so, he got taken back to the hospital at the hospital request on 14Jun2021, and she said to keep him bed rested at home and 2 days to be rested here that he fell or might now fell until we find care for him but we need to go back so she called 911, took him back to the hospital, second rehab and she came back to the hospital and they still could not find anything wrong with him and he got transferred on week later on 21Jun2021. Patient did not receive any other vaccine prior or during the covid vaccine. It was reported that he has both Diabetes and Hypertension but doctor was absent because he has Diabetes for about 25 years and when my aunt told them that she thought that it was related to the vaccines then they just said they have no idea. They just said they had no idea they wished what they knew what was wrong with him, because everything was normal with exception of elevated blood pressure, elevated sugar and elevated potassium. At the time of reporting, he weighed about 139 pounds. Since he has been out of hospital, he has lost about 25 pounds. Reporter stated that, she has to pay out of her pocket for his rehab because they did not know what was wrong with him and her insurance only cover certain amount of days and she was trying to figure out how she can get some assistance in paying for that rehab visit because they paid certain number of days and then she ready to go but he was not ready to come home so she had to pay out of her pocket to keep him there and also trying to see if that is something that pfizer would reimburse for. Reporter stated that, her insurance would not cover all the kind of aiding there and then they sent him home and then he had to back to his status because nurse said he should not be home he is too fragile and that was dangerous for him to keep him in the hospital, if he falls, he falls. She was asking if can either reimburse my aunt for the extra days that insurance did not cover, she had to pay out of her pocket for those because insurance did not cover everything and the doctors, nobody know what is wrong, they just says I wish I knew what was wrong, they can see that he was weak, they can see that he can not walk, he can not feed himself, so he can not be home and yet none of this happened if he did not have these vaccine. Upon follow up, reporter stated that, all events were reported yesterday, first was an ER visit, the doctor said they had no explanation, what was causing this, the weakness, he used to drive, he did daily walks, was active, it all started after the first injection, but at the time, no one knew to look for fatigue, they looked for flu like things and he fell a couple times, but he got the second shot, he got worse, and he went to ER because he fell and cracked his head on wall and cut it open, so he was taken to ER and admitted. Reporter did not know why the lady last night gave her a number that was not valid. Outcome of events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient was leaving the 15 minute post-vaccine monitoring area approximately  40 minutes after vaccine administration (administration of second dose at 08:42, rapid response called at 09:21).  He became pale, lethargic, diaphoretic, incontinent of urine, and collapsed onto his walker.  A rapid response was called.  Blood pressure on arrival by team  was  50&#39;s/30&#39;s, and fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride 500 mL was initiated while in transit to the ED.  Approximately 20 minutes later the patient&#39;s had stabilized but remained appropriately alert.

                                                Increased blood pressure; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 87-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1288 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left shoulder, on 14Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, atrial fibrillation, and cholesterol. Concomitant medication included omeprazole, apixaban (ELIQUIS), and atorvastatin. Patient previously took pneumonia vaccine. On Jan2021, patient noticed an increased blood pressure (usually his BP is around 120, now has consistently been around 150). Prior to the shot, he has not been on blood pressure medication. His blood pressure usually runs high 120s to 130s on the top, and mid 50-60 on the bottom. His blood pressure prior to the vaccine that day was 132/56. Then a couple of days after the first shot, the top number of his blood pressure was in the high 150s, but the same on the bottom. Patient was wondering if he has a problem, or is this a side effect. He went in as a senior. He didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. The blood pressure difference started a couple of days after his first shot. He was scheduled for his second shot 4Feb2021. He has had no other side effects or anything. There was no swelling, no fever, no chills and he felt good. Just his blood pressure has been an issue. Outcome of the event was not recovered.

An 87-year-old male received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 19Jan2021 at 16:00 at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 87-year-old. Lot number was EL3249. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, by-pass surgery in 1999 then high blood pressure in 1999, gout (diagnosed before 1999, it was an on and off thing, he had flare ups, the last one was at Christmas time), High cholesterol (diagnosed in 2000 or 2001), diabetes, anemia. Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) in 2014 for atrial fibrillation. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine in Sep2020 for immunization. On 20Jan2021, the patient was anemic. On 21Jan2021 at 02:30, nose bled. The patient just kept wiping his nose for thirty minutes before it stopped. On 20Jan2021, hemoglobin resulted 12.6, hematocrit was 3.9. The patient went to the hematologist the day before the report who said the patient was low on iron, hemoglobin and hematocrit were low, so he had to get an iron infusion the day of report for that (the patient went every three months and if his iron was low he got an infusion). The patient recovered from nose bled on 21Jan2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.

The next day the leg weakness was more significant and went to the emergency room where they found greater weakness in the left leg than the right leg. An MRI showed &#34;Punctate focus of diffusion restriction within the left cerebellar vermis consistent with acute infarct.&#34; He was also found to have a critically low platelet level of 30 and then 27 while in the emergency room. He was then admitted to the hospital, placed on steroids to increase his platelet level and given physical therapy following the stroke. He was admitted to the hospital for a total of 3 nights. He was discharged home on Aspirin, Carvedilol, and Atorvastatin, has follow up with hematology to check platelets and physical therapy.

He also complained of shortness of breath, which was an indication for a COVID-19 test. The specimen was collected and came back positive on 4/25. After a day at the hospital, the patient developed increased shortness of breath, had 80% oxygen saturation on a non-rebreather mask with subsequent upgrade to BiPap, and was using accessory muscles of respiration. His CXR on 4/25 on admission showed patchy b/l infiltrates. CT confirmed findings of CXR and was found to have ground glass opacities. The patient&#39;s ABG showed hypoxemia. On the morning of 4/27, the patient was found to be severely hypoxic and was electively intubated. As this form is being filled out, the patient is in the ICU on a ventilator due to COVID-19 pneumonia.

Hospital Course:   COVID-19 pneumonia.  The patient was treated with convalescent plasma and IV remdesivir and completed the course.  He was treated initially with IV Decadron which has been transitioned to oral tablets for discharge to complete a 10-day course.   Chronic systolic heart failure.  Coronary artery disease.  Orthostatic hypotension in the setting of chronic hypertension.  The patient does have chronic systolic heart failure with an EF around 20% and is followed closely at the heart failure clinic.  He is chronically prescribed Lasix at 80 mg twice daily, however he did have some episodes of orthostatic hypotension during his hospitalization and has been unable to tolerate other guideline directed medical therapy due to his hypotension.  He is euvolemic at this time.  I have decreased his Lasix dosing to 40 mg twice daily to restart tomorrow morning.  His last dose of the 80 mg of Lasix was yesterday morning.  I do feel that in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased oral intake that he is more at risk for continued hypotension and dehydration aggressive diuresis.  He will remain on aspirin, Plavix, and simvastatin.   Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His last hemoglobin A1c showed good control at 6.3 on 3/3/2021.  His glipizide was held while inpatient.  He was on long-acting Lantus insulin 10 units with stable blood sugars in the hospital.  He was also on correctional lispro insulin.  His glipizide will be resumed upon discharge.

He was found to have Covid pneumonia and      was treated with maximal support but unfortunately became profoundly delirious and developed      worsening hypoxia associated with Covid pneumonia.  Family was called to the bedside due to      progression in his illness and concerns for cardiac dysrhythmias occurring in the setting of      worsening hypoxia on maximal support.  Decision was made to transition to comfort care and      aggressive life-prolonging interventions were discontinued for primary focus on comfort.  Patient     subsequently expired at 1810 on 04/18/2021.           Patient was vaccinated against COVID 19.   Death Certificate Information:  Part 1: Cause of Death: A. COVID B.

An 88-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3302), intramuscular at the right arm on 25Jan2021 02:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered in a Nursing Home. No other vaccine was given to the patient in four weeks. Medical history included Parkinsons, dementia, diastolic heart failure and known allergies: Iodine, Propranolol. Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL), melatonin, quetiapine fumarate (SEROQUEL), ropinirole and sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT).  On 26Jan2021 11:30 AM, the patient was throwing up foamy stuff and his oxygen saturation was in the 80%s and was confused. The events led to Emergency room/department or urgent care visit. Treatment was given for the events. The patient has no COVID-19 prior to vaccination. He was tested for COVID-19 on 26Jan2021 with Nasal Swab, Rapid Test and the result was negative. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Before the vaccine, there was no problem with my heart rate.  Now, I am taking Labeatol 4 times a day to keep rate at least at 90.  This vaccine has doubled my heart rate.  It was 70 before the vaccine.  Now if I do not take my Labetalol, it goes up to 140.  Because my body is working so hard with that heart rate, it is making my sugar low.  So now I&#39;m taking less insulin and this whole situation is getting confusing on how to handle this long term, adverse reaction to the Pfizer vaccine.

Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

                                                On Sunday afternoon, March 14, I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccination. On the morning of March 16 I had a sudden hit of fatigued and my left leg started going numb while doing some menial work in the yard, The numbness cleared when I went inside and laid down but some form of the fatigue persisted for several days. Then, on March 28, two weeks after the vaccine, I woke up to a leg severely swollen from toe to hip. I waited two days to see if it went down but it only got worse, swelling to double the size by volume. I went to the doctor and they sent me to the hospital for ultrasound, suspecting a blood clot. No blood clot was evident but there were multi swollen limp nodes in the upper leg area. The problem worsened and two days later I was sent in for a CTscan which now showed multi blood clots near the swollen limp nodes. I was barely able to walk as major pain persisted with no signs of decline. I am now on blood thinner. It has been 2 months since the vacination and my leg is still swollen the same amount (2X by volume).

He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.  He had another episode of lethargy/unresponsiveness on 2/26/2021 and was once again sent to the hospital where they did not show any new findings.  He spent a few days in the hospital before returning to his facility where he continued to have periodic episodes of increased lethargy/confusion and decreased eating.  He was placed on Hospice and passed away on March 29th.

I take medicine 24/7 to control, to prevent rapid heartbeat. Usually my heart rate would be, and this was during the night I woke up and it was my pulse was 83 and that is very rapid for me especially since I am under the influence of the heart medicine (Unspecified Medication) to keep it down. Usually that time at night my heart rate would be about 60 and I had to take additional heart pills during for about 12 hours (further clarification unknown).&#34; When informed the role of Pfizer Drug Safety, consumer stated, &#34;But you don&#39;t, do you have any feedback or response from all this massive inoculation as to whether this is the, it was not a sudden fast heart rate and it was not sudden because I am under the medication 24/7.&#34; Consumer was informed about Pfizer Medical Information and offered the number. Consumer was provided with the number of Pfizer Medical Information # and was requested to select option 3, timings as and 8 am to 11 pm Monday to Sunday as per (EST).

An 89-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot/batch number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the arm on 14Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included unspecified blood thinners. The consumer is a veteran and had the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine first dose yesterday on 14Jan2021. He had it in his arm and got a print-out that he took out and it says something about if you have a bleeding disorder and are on blood thinners. His provider did not ask him. He wanted to know if this vaccine is a blood thinner. He felt good after getting it and went to sleep last night. He got up and sort of hack up from lungs to spit out and it was blood and was like that from 6am-7am on 15Jan2021. It was also reported that he was spitting a blood about seven or eight times but then it stopped. He is okay now. Nothing is happening. He wanted to know if he should take a blood thinner when he gets the second one. He would feel like he should not take the blood thinner when he gets the second one. The outcome of the event was recovered on 15Jan2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Got first dose of COVID shot wed.. A&amp;Ox1. Has left sided weakness from prior CVA  History of Present Illness     89-year-old male who presents to the ER via EMS with confusion.  He has also reportedly had a cough and some fever.  There has been some report of incontinence of both bowel and bladder.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 3/17.  He and his wife have returned to the home after wintering in another state.  According to his wife, with whom I have spoken this evening, last night he suddenly became confused.  The confusion continued throughout the day today, thus prompting the EMS called to the house and the subsequent journey to the ED for further evaluation.   In the ER this evening, a battery of testing was completed.  A Covid swab is indeed positive.  His wife is uncertain of any positive contacts.  He had some vascular congestion on chest x-ray.  He has a prior history of pleural effusion which is thought to be resolved.  He does have a history of lower extremity edema.  He had some urinary incontinence and his wife held his Lasix Saturday morning.  He was noted to be slightly hypoxic around 88% on room air.  He was around 85% or so on room air at home with their home pulse oximeter device.  He has been placed on 2 L of nasal cannula.

                                                Shortness of breath; bradycardia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. An 89-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6200), intramuscular in left arm on 24Feb2021 12:00 PM (received at the age of 89-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within the four weeks prior to receiving BNT162B2. Medical history included known COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), hypertensive heart, CKD 3 (chronic kidney disease stage 3), and history of breast cancer. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. He had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included multiple unspecified medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EL9265), intramuscular in left arm on 02Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that the patient developed shortness of breath (SOB) and bradycardia 3 days after vaccination, on 27Feb2021. 1 day after that, 28Feb2021, it worsened, and the patient was admitted with SOB and bradycardia. Has known COPD, not on any negative chronotropic medication. The patient was cleared after a day in the hospital. The reported adverse events resulted in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit and hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days (28Feb2021 to 02Mar2021). As corrective treatment, the patient received oral steroid. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date. The patient underwent Covid test post vaccination: Nasal Swab on 28Feb2021 with result of negative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

An 89-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 12:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included vascular dementia; hypertension; hypothyroidism; malignant melanoma of back (resected/in remission); bladder cancer (surgery in Nov2018/in remission); prediabetic; chronic kidney disease stage 3 due to hypertension; and sleep related hypoxia. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included donepezil taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; memantine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; levothyroxine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lisinopril taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lovastatin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; fluoxetine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and unspecified multivitamin tablet. The patient previously received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19) on 26Feb2021 07:45 PM in the left arm for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has not received other vaccine in four weeks. The first day after the shot, there were not any adverse reactions. The next morning at approximately 11:00 am, the reporter found patient laying on the floor next to his bed, eyes glazed over, disoriented, and he said &#34;he felt funny&#34;. The reporter got him sitting up leaning on the side of the bed and called. The EMT&#39;s came and checked his vitals. Within half an hour from  finding the patient laying on the floor, he seemed almost back to normal. However, since he is 89 years old, the patient was transported by ambulance. Blood was drawn, a urine sample was taken, a chest Xray, and a CT scan of his head and his spine were the labs that were run. All the labs came back normal. However, once patient got home after being in the ER for 5 hours, he is very weak, can barely stand and barely walk without human assistance and his walker. The way he is acting is more like he had a stroke. Onset of the events reported as 20Mar2021 11:15 AM. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient used walker due to can barely stand and barely walk; for other events, there was no treatment given.
