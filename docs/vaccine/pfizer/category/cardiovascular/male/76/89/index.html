                                                Assessment: Individual stated he was feeling lightheaded approximately four minutes after receiving his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine via IM injection in his upper arm. Individual was seated at the time and was about to move from the vaccination station to the check out desk.  PT attempted to stand and said, ?Oh, I don?t feel so good?, after which vaccinator inquired with PT on what was wrong. After a brief assessment, notified personnel of the situation. Individual remained with the vaccinator, who obtained a set of vital signs and continued an assessment.  Vitals: (as I recollect, I gave the post it to the check out staffers who monitored the individual prior to his departure) BP: 126/54, P: 78, RR: 18, pale and sweating across his brow area. Denied chest pain, difficulty breathing, nausea, tingling, headache, stated only symptom was lightheaded ness which was dissipating. Provided the individual with bottled water to sip on, which he did. Individual?s last oral intake was at ~0845 PTA at the clinic, a normal breakfast of eggs, toast and coffee. Individual stated he had several cups of coffee but had not had anything else to drink that morning. Individual receives dialysis three days per week. He had an appointment Wednesday, next appointment is Friday. Individual did not have anyone driving him to the clinic, stated he would be fine and did not have anyone to come pick him up. He stated he was feeling better already.  After approximately 8 additional minutes, individual stated he thought he could get up and move to the check out station.  Individual was able to stand an ambulate to the check out line. Upon arrival at check out, transferred the individual to the check out personnel and Exit workers to monitor the individual?s condition for the remainder of the 30 minutes.

                                                On Saturday 2/6/21 in the morning on the left side under  armpit felt like he had a pulled muscle or something. It eventually radiated over up into the left quadrant of his chest where he could not push down on it.  It was extremely painful by Monday.  He has a history of esophageal spasms and exacerbated them to where he thought he was having a heart attack.  He called his Cardiologist and told him to go to the ER.  He went to the hospital Monday evening, he had two EKG&#39;s, had blood drawn 3 times, did sonograms looking for blood clots.  He did inform them that he had the vaccine on Friday and they told him it was due to that.  He went to nuclear medicine to get his lung checked for blood clots as well.  All tests were negative.  He saw his PCP today who told him that the lymph nodes were affected due to the vaccine.  He has improved greatly, still has some slight discomfort which his PCP said would go away in time.

A 76-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm on 05Mar2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at the age of 76-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included congestive heart failure, aortic valve replacement couple of years ago. Concomitant medication includes aspirin 325mg once per day by mouth. On 05Mar2021, the patient went into Afib, his heart rate went up and the next day on 06Mar2021, his blood pressure dropped really low but his pulse went really high and carried it that way for a few days and then he went pretty much back to normal.  On 05Mar2021, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation for 22 hours and since that time his blood pressure and pulse have remained erratic. The reporter stated that the patient has returned to normal and his pulse is still a little high and his pulse used to run in the 70&#39;s and maybe 80 but today (15Mar2021), the pulse was still 95; on 06Mar2021, the patient took his blood pressure twice and is not sure at what time he checked it but one time it was 98/65 and the pulse was 114 at that time and the other time the blood pressure was 88/59 and the pulse was 115. States the patient&#39;s blood pressure pretty much turned back to normal on 10Mar2021 and the blood pressure started being normal on 10Mar2021. On 15Mar20021, the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 140/76 and the pulse is still real high at 95 today and he weighs himself, takes his blood sugar and blood pressure every day. Regarding the treatment, the reporter and the patient saw the patient&#39;s cardiologist this past Friday 12Mar2021 and put the patient on Metoprolol and the blood thinner Eliquis; states the patient was just taking a whole Aspirin and had previously had aortic valve replacement a couple of years ago and the HCP reduced his aspirin dose down to a low dose of Aspirin and then put him on the Eliquis at the HCP appointment. The reporter stated, for the Metoprolol and Eliquis she does not know the dosages or frequency of how the patient takes them at this time; states she has no lot numbers for the Metoprolol, Eliquis or Aspirin to provide as they are not with her at this time. The outcome of the event his blood pressure and pulse have remained erratic was not recovered; while the other events was recovered. Treatment has been given for the events.

After that had 1 hour of uncontolled severe shaking and shivering . Next day felt fine.  Afew days started noticing LOW FREQUENCY INTERMITTANT TINNITUS THAT IS A HUM, BUT ONLY IF I AM AROUND HIGH VOLTAGE POWER TRANSMISSION LINES AND POWER TRANSFORMERS .  HEAR IT IN MY HOME  WHICH IS 1000 FEET FROM HIGH VOLTAGE LINES 24/7 SINCE DAY 2-4 OF DOSE #1.  Can hear it in other enclosed areas, but doesn&#39;t seem to happen AS MUCH outdoors, although if I am within 1000 feet of high voltage lines I will hear it UNLESS  there are many trees to block the EMF&#39;s or HUM between me and the source.  SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT IS TRUE  FOR PAST 3 MONTHS 24/7 AND HAS RUINED MY LIFE BECAUSE I CANNOT SLEEP AND SLEEPING PILLS DON&#39;T WORK.   HAS DISRUPTED MY SLEEP CENTER SOMEHOW.  ALL OF THIS IS SINCE FIRST COIVD19 SHOT !  HAVE HAD #2 SHOT AND WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER !

A 76-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 (at the age of 76 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took NSAIDS. The patient experienced DVT L leg, possible PE on 12Mar2021. Treatment given included Eliquis. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events deep vein thrombosis and possible pulmonary embolism occurred in a plausible temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He had his nurse take an ECG and after his review he said that I had new onset Atrial Fibrillation.  He prescribed the blood thinner, Eliquis 5mg twice daily, and recommended that I schedule an appointment with my Cardiologist.  I had an appointment with cardiologist on 03/17/2021 and he confirmed my Atrial Fibrillation.

It must be noted that annual visits to my three doctors over a past period of 5 years, never showed that I had an irregular heartbeat or Atrial Fibrillation prior to its first discovery by PCP on 03/10/2021,  exactly one week after my second Pfizer Covid 19 vaccination.

He had his nurse take an ECG and after his review he said that I had new onset Atrial Fibrillation.  He prescribed the blood thinner, Eliquis 5mg twice daily, and recommended that I schedule an appointment with my Cardiologist.  I had an appointment with my Cardiologist on 03/17/2021 and he confirmed my Atrial Fibrillation.  He scheduled me for a Transthoracic Echo (TTE) Complete with PRN definity on 04/08/2021 which was completed.

A 76-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EP7534), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Mar2021 08:30 (at 76 years old), single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Low thyroid, Possible atrial fibrillation,  there was a question of whether he had atrial fibrillation in years past but it was never determined with certainty whether the caller actually had atrial fibrillation. He went to see a cardiologist years ago for the possible atrial fibrillation but the tests came back negative; Knees were so painful. Every time his family went overseas, he got tetanus, typhoid, diphtheria, and other vaccines. The vaccines were all done in military facilities.  He received these vaccines somewhere between the ages of 0 and 15 years old. Patient&#39;s tetanus and diphtheria booster in 2007 caused a sore arm. The shingles vaccine in 2012 caused a sore arm. The Prevnar-23 vaccine in 2013 or 2014 caused a sore arm. He was adopted so he doesn&#39;t know his family history. He heard anecdotal evidence that his mother suffered a stroke and died at 61 but that his father lived apparently well into his 90&#39;s.The patient had his first dose of bnt162b2 for COVID-19 immunisation on 23Feb2021, left arm, lot number: EN6200. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine; vitamin c [ascorbic acid]; chondroitin sulfate sodium, glucosamine hydrochloride; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3); aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid].  Patient experienced 15 hours after he received his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 17Mar2021, he had a stroke.Stroke occurred at 11:30 PM on 17Mar2021. He was admitted on 18Mar2021 as the stroke occurred so late on 17Mar2021. He was discharged late in the afternoon on 22Mar2021. He has vastly improved. He is not 100% recovered but that he has made great strides and great improvements. He was in great shape before the stroke on 17Mar2021. For a guy his age, he has the vitals of a 19 year old.    he was walking 2 to 3 miles or biking for 30-45 minutes daily, lifting weights three times a week, and doing yoga before the stroke. He was in good shape and that he thinks that may have had a part in bringing him back quickly from the stroke.   we are only a month in post-stroke, and that he is not 100% but he is very close, probably 90% back.He was started on Atorvastatin and Clopidogrel after his stroke. He takes the vitamins as a prophylactic for overall health. The glucosamine and chondroitin seems to have helped his knee pain immensely. He has been wearing a heart monitor since his stroke on 17Mar2021. He noted an irregular heartbeat once when he woke up about a week ago. The irregular heartbeat occurred maybe on 15Apr2021. There was just one episode of irregular heartbeat. All of his stroke assessments kept improving and getting better while he was hospitalized after his stroke on 17Mar2021.The hospital was performing CT scans and MRIs practically daily while in the hospital.One of the CT scans that he got showed a brain bleed. He thinks the CT scan that showed a brain bleed was after tPA, tissue plasminogen activator, had been administered. The repeat CT scans and MRIs were because the medical staff wanted to ensure that there was no further damage or bleed after the tissue plasminogen activator was administered.One CT scan showed that he had a small bleed in the cerebellum. The bleed in his cerebellum was probably because of the tissue plasminogen activator that was administered but it doesn&#39;t seem to have any lasting effects.Caller queried for product details of tissue plasminogen activator but he was unable to provide as it was administered in the hospital.His balance is back, he is riding a bike again, he is going for walks, and he does not feel dizzy.His balance returned probably about 2 weeks ago.On 17Mar2021, he was so dizzy that he couldn&#39;t raise himself up in bed.   the dizziness was slow to resolve and probably resolved in the last week.The minor infarct on his first CT scan performed after his stroke on 17Mar2021 may have occurred previously.The hospital staff performed a CT scan after the patient arrived at the hospital following his 17Mar2021 stroke.Hospital staff administered the tissue plasminogen activator after the first CT scan and that another CT scan was performed 12 hours later after tissue plasminogen activator administration. The CT after the tissue plasminogen activator administration showed the small bleed in his cerebellum. He has had video visits with occupational therapy, physical therapy, his neurologist, and he had one scheduled for a speech therapist but she didn&#39;t want to talk to him.His therapists and physician say that he is ok and there is no reason for them to see the caller again. He had one follow up with his occupational therapist and the therapist told the caller that she didn&#39;t see any reason to see the caller again. The outcome of the event Stroke was recovering; Cerebellar bleeding, infarction was unknown, other events was recovered.

He was evaluated by the EMS at 10:10 and transported to the ED at 10:39 am. Upon arrival, his systolic BP was 90 mmHg with normal heart rate. He was monitored and discharged home with the final diagnosis of vasovagal syncopal response.

                                                He was sent to the ER later that day when he complained of headache and palpitations and his blood pressures and heart rate were unusually high.  He had at no time any chest pain.   At the ER, he had two serial troponins at 0.06, representing a mild enzyme leak.  He had no EKG changes concerning for ischemia or arryhtmia but his BP was noted to be in 170/100&#39;s which is higher than his baseline in the 140&#39;s.  It came down on its own eventually.  It was determined that if anything, he may have ha some demand ischemia from his hypertension, and that in the future he should at least get a TTE, or if he can tolerate, a cardiac stress test.  He returned without any medication changes.

Patient transferred from Spinal Cord Injury until to ICU on 1/11/2021 due to worsneing dyspnea, hypoxia (80s) and tachycardia and was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure likely 2/2 multifocal pneumonia. CXR findings of &#34;There is interval increase in patchy airspace infiltrates and consolidation in bilateral lungs concerning for pneumonia&#34; Patient was started on vancomycin and pip/tazo on 1/11 and tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained for VAP diagnosis which ultimately grew Serratia liquifaciens and Proteus mirabilis. Infectious Diseases was consulted who recommended a switch to ertapenem therapy for a total 10 day course for VAP. UCx/BCx remained negative. On 1/20, a therapeutic bronchoscopy was completed with cultures growing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and pan-S Klebsiella pneumoniae. The following day a chest tube was inserted and the course of ertapenem completed but vancomycin was continued. By 1/22, patient developed shock liver with ALT/AST 2135/1579 from normal range the day prior and SCr increased to 1.3 from baseline 0.7/cystatin C of 2.46 up from 1.15. Levofloxacin was added for Stenotrophomonas coverage. By 1/25, patient&#39;s clinical status continued to decline and Cardiology was consulted for new onset Afib with RVR. Discussion was documented with patient&#39;s family who requested DNR. Patient passed away in the early AM on 1/26.

                                                I am 77 yrs old, male , ,  150# and 5ft 6inches...Within 24 hours of receiving the shot, my body thru-up clots in my left leg. and I spent 4 days in the hospital ( 3 days in surgical ICU), breaking up the clots to save the leg. This is too much of a coincidence to ignore and I will not receive the 2nd shot.

On 2/17 (three days after vaccination), he sought care in the emergency department for chest pain that worsened when he was supine and shortness of breath.   EKG in the emergency room showed STEMI and troponin levels were normal. He was transferred to a different facility for cardiac catheterization. Cath showed mild circumflex disease and a stent was placed. He was diagnosed with pericarditis at that time (elevated inflammatory markers ESR/CRP). He was discharged home post cath on Plavix/ASA.   He had an echocardiogram at his PCP?s office on 2/25, results still pending (as of 3/10).  2/25 ? televist with cardiologist who concurred with pericarditis, maybe mild coronary artery disease (follow-up scheduled 3/11).  3/3 chest pain symptom improved further, no cough, improved shortness of breath.      Medications at home: statin, previously colchine for gout, likely BP medication (PCP will send records)  Allergies: None known.  Vaccine Indication: Age &gt;75

When he woke up the next morning he had tightness in his chest that last a while and then went away.  A couple of days later he had a dizzy spell which would come and go.  This lasted about 3 days.  He had another episode of tightness in his chest.  On 3/7/2021 he developed a red rash on his chest that had a hive in the middle of it that was itchy.  He started getting itchy spots on the top of his hands, fore arms, top of his ears, and the top of his head.   At this time he only has slight rash on his chest and shoulders that are not itching.

This 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EK5730), via an unknown route, on 17Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 78-year-old. The patient was diabetic and hypertensive. Additional medical history included hyperlipidaemia. No relevant concomitant medications were provided. On 18Dec2020, the patient developed severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body. On 19Dec2020, the patient developed achy. On 20Dec2020, the patient was dehydrated and hypotensive, he had also chills.  On unknown date, blood pressure was down to 76/50. His symptoms for COVID were severe achy cramps, hypotension, and dehydration. On 20Dec2020, COVID-19 test was positive. On 21Dec2020, the patient was given monoclonal antibodies.  A computerized tomogram (CT) of the lungs was performed on 21Dec2020 and it was ok. A week later (Dec2020), he had a repeat CT which showed increased infiltrates of 10 to 15%. He then started on dexamethasone, apixaban (ELIQUIS) and the rest of the things. He had a repeat CT on 05Jan2021 which showed resolution of the infiltrates; most of the lesions went gone. CT results had improved significantly. The patient underwent a second COVID test a week ago which was still positive. He had a third COVID on 06Jan2021, but results were not available yet. The patient queried if he can proceed with second dose planned on 07Jan2021 or if he should wait. The clinical outcome was recovered for the event &#39;severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body&#39; on 19Dec2020, for &#39;dehydration/dehydrated&#39; on 20Dec2020, for &#39;chills&#39; on unknown date in Dec2020, for &#39;achy&#39; on 30Dec2020, for &#39;hypotensive&#39; on 20Dec2020; the outcome of the event &#39;CT showed increased infiltrates 10-15%&#39; was recovering; the outcome for &#39;Tested positive for COVID-19&#39; was unknown.  The reporter considered the events &#39;achy&#39; and &#39;severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body&#39; serious because causing disability; the events &#39;tested positive for COVID-19&#39;, &#39;dehydration/dehydrated&#39;, &#39;chills&#39; and &#39;hypotensive&#39; were considered medically significant.  The reporter considered the events &#39;Tested positive for COVID-19&#39;, &#39;CT showed increased infiltrates 10-15%&#39; and &#39;dehydrated/dehydration&#39; unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

                                                Lightheadedness; Headache; tightness in his chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EK4176, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm/ shoulder area on 15Jan2021 at 11:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, patient has epilepsy that has been controlled since 1977; and issues with his blood pressure. He has no allergies. Concomitant medications included phenobarbital and phenytoin (DILANTIN), both for epilepsy. He takes HTZ TRI something, it is a long word but is basically 2 diuretic. He is also being followed by a cardiologist. Patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient got the COVID injection 2.5 hours ago on 15Jan2021 and after that he had a slight case of lightheadedness. He was instructed to drink water and walk if he was able, he did that and it helped. The patient relays that he was fasting that morning and thinks that had some degree of relatedness in the lightheaded feeling. He ate lunch and the light headedness resolved but now he has a slight headache. He was reading the paperwork and on the form under severe reactions, it mentions dizziness, weakness, and difficulty breathing. While he is breath ok, he has noticed a slight degree of tightness in his chest. He did not see this listed but wants to know if this is normal or if it would be related to the difficulty breathing. His main concern is if this is a severe reaction. He had lab work done prior to getting the vaccine, then none afterward. The events did not require visit to emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the event &#39;lightheadedness&#39; was recovered while unknown for the other events.

A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EN5318; dose 1) intramuscularly on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 78-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 25Jan2021 during the 15 minute waiting period after the vaccine, the patient experienced dizziness. He denied difficulty breathing and swallowing. A differential diagnosis of systemic reaction (hypoglycemia, hypotension, generalized rash) was provided. The patient was given unspecified treatment and follow-up response was good. The patient denied dizziness when standing up and walking to leave the medical evaluation bay and clinical outcome of dizziness was completely resolved prior to discharge.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Went to bed and by mid afternoon shivers were gone as well as sweating. Slept all day and into the evening, by 10pm or so all seemed back to normal. Mid afternoon I sat up on the edge of the bed to go to the bathroom and passed out falling on my left knee (bad one) and hit my forehead on the bathroom door scraping and bruising same above left eye brow. Walking with pain in left knee but getting better daily.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information.

                                                During my earlier years working in an industrial area I had inhaled asbestos which caused me to have plural thickening in my lungs. Every year since that diagnosis I have been required to annual Pulmanary (lung and heart) testing. On February 11th I had my 30th annual Pulmonary exam consisting of EKG, Stress Test, and Chest X-ray. As in the past, results were all good. On March 3rd I had my 1st Pfizer vaccination. Five days later on March 8th I collapsed, was taken to the hospital by ambulance having suffered a massive Pulmonary Embolism affecting my heart and right lung. During my 2 hour operation, Surgeons used a flexible suction tube inserted thru my groan to remove a large blood clot (embolectomy). Pieces totaling about 14cm long, 2cm wide and 1/2 cm thick. I was discharged 3 days later and instructed to take blood thinning medication probably for the rest of my life. I am now 78 years old.

States he took some additional medication and it went back down to 82, then up to 128, down to 48, up to 115; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 10Apr2021 15:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib) on 10Mar2021 (had A-Fib while hospitalized from 10Mar2021 to 22Mar2021. Did a cardioversion) and Guillain Barre syndrome on an unspecified date. Concomitant medication included metoprolol taken for heart (disorder). It was reported that on 10Apr2021 15:30, the patient got his first vaccine. The next morning (11Apr2021 08:30) when he did his vital check, that he does every morning, his heart rate was 131. Stated that he took some additional medication and it went back down to 82, then up to 128, down to 48, up to 115. Stated he was reading where fast heart rate can be one of the side effects. Stated today (12Apr2021) the highest his heart rate has been is 109 and lowest at 42. The patient stated that his heart rate goes from high to low. The patient stated that he normally takes Metoprolol 25 mg a day but he upped it to 100 mg on 11Apr2021 because that&#39;s what they did when he had AFib. The outcome of the event was recovering.

That afternoon began complaining of abdominal pain with subsequent vomiting (x2) and possible diarrhea. Patient could not sleep that evening . Awoke next morning with continued abdominal pain throughout the day and ultimately was found unresponsive in bed. Transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Subsequently autopsy was performed which revealed significant pre-existing hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with evidence of acute myocardial infarction. There is no clear evidence that this is related to the vaccination, however it is being reported due to potential public health interest and temporal proximity to vaccination.

                                                DVT was twice as bad; death/natural process; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse reporting for reporter&#39;s husband. A 78-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (reported as COVID vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 20Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6201; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as 2nd dose, single (at the age of 78-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes, Liver cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, Kidney stone, sarcoidosis, blood pressure abnormal, high cholesterol, pacemaker and they putted the IVC filter for blood clot. Concomitant medications included insulin, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide and omeprazole (PROTONIX), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EN6201; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) on 27Feb2021 at the age of 78-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on 12Mar2021, and went into the hospital 12Mar2021. Then the patient had the second COVID shot on 20Mar2021 and the reporter had taken him right back into the hospital couple days later because the DVT got twice as worst. The patient experienced DVT was twice as bad on an unspecified date in Mar2021, which required hospitalization on 22Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests, he had lab tests on 22Mar2021 when he went in and he probably had them on 23rd and 24th of Mar2021. The reporter didn&#39;t know what all the lab tests were done in the hospital. The patient died on 12Apr2021. The reporter stated they put Reason of death as natural process because she sent him in the Hospice. An autopsy was not performed. The outcome of event DVT was unknown. The reporter considered there was a causal relationship, when he got his second COVID shot on 20Mar2021 and then he went back in the hospital on 22Mar2021 and the DVT was twice as bad.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported DVT. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: death/natural process

                                                loss of consciousness; respiratory distress Narrative: Patient tolerated his 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccine well, on 12/16/2020, and received his 2nd dose on 1/6/2021. Patient had some mild clinical decline the past few days prior to 2nd vaccination, with a decreased appetite and some increased fatigue per nursing report, but no significant changes. He experienced nausea on the evening of 1/6/21, which was effectively managed, but by early morning he spiked a fever of 102.9 with a sat of 86.1%. He continued to deteriorate from that point on and died 1/7/21 @13:20. Clinically, the presentation was most consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.

Patient was hyperkalemic and in acute renal failure at time of transfer. Hyperkalemia was treated, but the patient suffered PEA vs VFib. At the time of transfer, patient was on vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. The patient had an EF of 40-45% and elevated troponins.  Patient was made DNR and placed on comfort care. Patient passed away on 1/18/2021. Ultimately we suspect that the patients condition was a direct result of his underlying disease states, but wanted to make sure reporting was made available.

An elderly 79 years old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number and expiry date were not provided) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications includes Aspirin. The reporter informed that her father (patient) received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday (17Jan2021) and today (18Jan2021), he experienced nose bleed. The patient had a nose bleed which lasted for a pretty long time. The patient just tried to stop it in a regular way. Just pinching the nose and stuff like that. The reporter did not know if there is any other medication that he takes only the Aspirin. The reporter just wanted to know if this was normal side effect. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (18Jan2021): New information received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) included: concomitant drug, event details.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization (wanted to get because of the virus). The patient&#39;s medical history included hard of hearing and diabetes (reported as &#34;diabetes and stuff). Concomitant medications included empagliflozin (JARDIANCE), dulaglutide (TRULICITY), and other medications (as reported &#34; I take stuff for blood pressure all kind of stuff&#34;). The patient reported that he got the vaccine on Tuesday (12Jan2021), he stated that he has diabetes and stuff and he noticed on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday his sugar was elevated a whole lot and he thought that would be possibly from the vaccine or it might be stressed because the Covid (unspecified). He stated that he doesn&#39;t know but it&#39;s unusual, he means it went real high. He wanted to know if there are any reports of like affects it might cause on hi sugar to go high. The patient checked this morning (unspecified date) it was high and just checked about 20 minutes ago and it has come down again so (further not clarified).&#34; The patient mentioned that he takes Jardiance and Trulicity, once a week; he took Trulicity this morning (unspecified date) and stated, &#34;so that probably helped&#34;. He had an unspecified laboratory test about 3 months ago, and there was no problem.&#34; The outcome of event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

That&#39;s my normal heart rate. I am pretty healthy and I do a lot exercise and lot of power walking, so my heart rate is &#39;not so&#39; low. That afternoon (28Jan2021) I walk, my power walk training miles. I started to feel very weak and at night I took my blood pressure it wasn&#39;t too bad. It was 139 over 78 with a 61 heart rate and then next morning I woke up and my blood pressure had gone up to medically and heart rate almost doubled. Next morning (29Jan2021) at 10 am my blood pressure was 139 over 95 and a 97 heart rate.

                                                Male patient who to the hospital on 3/15/2021 due to 10 days of shortness of breath on exertion and right-sided chest pain.   He went to his PCP for follow-up and had a CT PE study today which was positive for right upper lobe and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism.  He notes that he received a 2nd 5 0 COVID-19 vaccination on March 6th and since then has not felt well, feeling short of breath and generally fatigued.  He notes that he has not been very active since receiving the vaccine.   CT PE study showed an increased RV to LV ratio 1.2.  He had no elevation in his troponin or BNP.  His echocardiogram showed an EF of 60% and there were no wall motion abnormalities and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient would prefer Eliquis at this time.  He will need a 6 month course of Eliquis.  Given the setting of recent COVID vaccination and recent decreased mobility as possible provoking factors, this will be treated as a provoked pulmonary embolus.  Per hospital COVID vaccine protocol, patient presentation will be reported to pharmacy for FDA reporting.

Patient drove himself to the hospital for evaluation and treatment on Saturday, March 27th where he collapsed in cardiac arrest. he was resuscitated and stabilized on life support. He died of multiple organ failure on Monday March 29th. The official diagnosis was Severe Septic Shock. It is unclear if any infective agent was identified. It should be noted that sepsis is a condition in which immune dysregulation is inherent and includes cytokine storm activity. The possible correlation between vaccination and the subsequent development of sepsis should be investigated.

A 79-year-old male patient received the first dose and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), on 24Feb2021 (lot number EN6198) in the right arm, and on 20Mar2021 (lot number EP7534) (unsure which arm), respectively, both via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 79-years-old), as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and apixaban (ELIQUIS) film-coated tablet, oral from an unspecified date (lot number 1743875, expiration date Feb2023), at 5 mg, twice a day as blood thinner. The patient&#39;s medical history included: chronic lymphoma leukemia from 2006- he is presently MRD negative, cardiomyopathy, alcohol ablation- where they go in through the groin and shoot alcohol to shrink the size of the heart to kill the fat around the heart. There were no concomitant medications. In Feb2021, after the first dose, the patient experienced nose bleeds. The patient never had nose bleeds before until after getting the first dose and was having more since getting the second dose. He has had two in one day. He was asking if the vaccine causes nose bleeds with taking a blood thinner. The nose bleeds have been more frequent. The nose bleeds were reported as worsened. The nose bleeds did not require an emergency room or physician office visit. The action taken in response to nose bleeds/ worsened for apixaban was unknown. The outcome of nose bleeds/ worsened was not recovered.  Follow-up (26Mar2021): This is a follow up spontaneous report from a contactable consumer based on information received by Pfizer from US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB (manufacturer control number US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY-BMS-2021-031555), license party for apixaban (ELIQUIS).  This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: 2021339514) on 26-Mar-2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 30-Mar-2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of EPISTAXIS (Nose Bleeds) in 79-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) film-coated tablet (batch no. 1743875) for an unknown indication. CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included Covid-19 Vaccine for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s past medical history included Chronic lymphoid leukemia (He is presently MRD negative) in 2006, Cardiomyopathy and Alcohol septal ablation (where they go in through the groin and shoot alcohol to shrink the size of the heart to kill the fat around the heart). On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (batch no. 1743875) (Oral), 5 milligram twice a day. On 24-Feb-2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (unknown route). On an unknown date, the patient experienced EPISTAXIS (Nose Bleeds). The action taken with Eliquis(Oral) was unknown. At the time of the report, EPISTAXIS did not resolve. For Eliquis(Oral), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments. The reporter stated that he never had nose bleeds before until after getting the first dose and was having more since getting the second dose. He has had two in one day. He was asking if the vaccine caused nose bleeds with taking a blood thinner. The nose bleeds have been more frequent. He received he first dose on 24-Feb-2021 and the second dose on 20-Mar-2021.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients (father and mother). This is the first (father) of the two reports.  A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Dose 1) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 26Mar2021 (batch/lot number: ER8727) at 79 years old as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing AFib (atrial fibrillation) diagnosed between 1 and 2 years ago. Patient also has a pacemaker from an unknown date. Patient was exposed to COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) oral from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 5 mg twice a day taken for AFib (atrial fibrillation). On 07Apr2021, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to a fall; he fell in the bathroom and passed out. The patient is on Eliquis, so they were worried about bleeding. He tested positive for COVID on 07Apr2021, this was the same day he was admitted to the hospital. He was discharged on 10Apr2021 and was improving. It was reported that the reporter (patient&#39;s son) tested positive for COVID on 27Mar2021, so it was likely his parents were exposed or infected prior to their first dose of the vaccine. The reporter confirmed he has not been vaccinated. The patient was due to get the second shot today, but the reporter cancelled the appointment since his dad was still in quarantine. The reporter heard different things about when to get the second dose, everyone says to wait 90 days, they&#39;re getting mixed information, then he has heard 3 weeks is long enough to wait. The reporter wanted to know when his dad can get the second dose of the vaccine after having the COVID-19 infection. The patient is recovering from &#34;he fell in the bathroom and passed out.&#34; Outcome of the event &#34;tested positive for Covid&#34; was unknown.   This case involves a Product Complaint: Consumer reported that his father and mother tested positive for Covid infection on 07Apr2021 after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 26Mar2021. It was not provided if a sample of the product was available to be returned, if requested and if packaging was sealed and intact.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021443810 same reporter, same drug, same event, different patient

                                                chest pains; cough; rash; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumer (patient) via Medical information Team.  A 79-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Jan2021 at 14:15 (Lot Number: EL3248) as single dose; dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Feb2021 at 14:30 (Lot Number: EN6201) at the age of 79 years as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medication was not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 05Mar2021 the patient experienced chest pains, and cough, which required hospitalization from 05Mar2021 to 08Mar2021. The patient informed that he had some stress with son and daughter to point where he had some chest pains. After a week or two of conversation involving patients son and granddaughter culminated into this. The patient informed that when he went to the hospital because of chest pains, patient was already use to that and wasn&#39;t worried about it. The patient stated he didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital, called the doctor but because of Covid, the doctor wouldn&#39;t see the patient. The patient stated he shouldn&#39;t have been in the hospital at all. In terms of the cough, he simply called the doctor because the patient wanted cough medicine or something for that, temporary thing coming on. Patient stated the cough did not linger, and it was never treated.  The hospital got into the chest pain and jumped on the heart situation and patient thinks they saw dollar signs or something.  The patient wasn&#39;t very happy with them. The patient informed that he was given a blood thinner, Heparin IV during time hospitalized. The hospital decided to hold the patient over and they gave the patient Heparin IV for a good part of three days. The patient reported that he was discharged on 08Mar2021, and on 10Mar2021 the patient noticed the rash. The patient reporting experiencing rash after receiving both doses of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. The patient was thinking the combination of Plavix and heparin only three weeks after having the Pfizer Covid Vaccine could possibly be a side effect of rash. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rash. The doctor gave the patient Clobetasol Propionate and patient did treat rash with that.  The doctor said to apply for 2 weeks and come in on one week.  It has already improved. The patient mentions that he was also taking Calamine lotion and some spray and they all seem to be working.  Patient didn&#39;t want to keep taking Clobetasol because it is a steroid and he had been using for a month and didn&#39;t want to do that. The clinical outcome of rash was recovering. The clinical outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                heart attack; chest pressure; hardly slept; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife).  An 80-year-old male patient (reported also as 81-years-old, to be clarified) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot # EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 80-years-old. Medical history included ongoing emphysema and ongoing diabetes (caller has been diagnosed for 35 years for both conditions), heart was damaged because of the diabetes, and a history of bypass 4 years ago however he hasn&#39;t had any issues with chest pressure since before the bypass. Concomitant medications were none. On 15Jan2021 at 1:am he developed pressure in the chest which ultimately resolved. This trouble last night, lasted over 1 hour. He couldn&#39;t get back to bed. He had to sleep sitting up on the sofa. That was the only way he was comfortable. Her husband has hardly slept. She was seeing how he was doing. He said he was okay sitting. The pressure on his chest would go away while he was sitting, but laying down it would come back. This morning (15Jan2021) she made him check when he woke up at 8 o&#39;clock. She made him lay down, and he said it was gone after sitting the whole night. He is well now. He is feeling fine. He didn&#39;t even ask for help getting on his clothes. He got the vaccine because of his age and because of underlying conditions. Her husband has done very well this year. He even has underlying conditions. He has had Emphysema for 35 years, but it hasn&#39;t been bothering him. He has also had diabetes for 35 years. The reporter spoke to her husband&#39;s hcp (nurse) who said it could have a heart attack and for him to go to hospital if it reoccurs. She did speak with a nurse with his primary doctor, and she said the pressure in his chest for 1 hour could have been a heart attack. That if it occurs again to give him the nitroglycerin. She told the nurse it wasn&#39;t pain. The reporter stated chest pressure could have been a heart attack. He is scheduled to get the 2nd dose on 21Jan2021. The reporter was wondering if her husband can have the second dose given it has potassium in it (given he has bypass history). The reporter is afraid the vaccine is not safe, and they may not go for the second vaccine. She wants more information if it is safe.  The events recovered on 15Jan2021.

He was anxious feeling and could hear it blowing in his ears (which happens when his blood pressure is high). He stated he has never had his blood pressure that high and has never had any heart problems.

                                                Patient received 2nd dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine, was observed in office x 15&#43; minutes, and released home. Pt and his son exited the building and when they got to the car, the pt shouted out &#34;oh no!&#34; and collapsed to the ground. The patient was unconscious experiencing agonal respirations, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. There is an Emergency Room at the same location. Their staff came out and helped to transfer the pt to the ED for further evaluation. It was found that the patient had a known  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm (7/28/2017) that seemed to have ruptured. The patient was stabilized and transported to our local hospital and upon arrival, he was effectively comatose with a GCS 3. CT Head notated an extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage most probably related to a bleeding anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Neuro-Interventional Radiologist dictation reads &#34;Hunt Hess 5 Fisher grade 4 extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage and early hydrocephalus secondary to rupture of a known anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  Initial ICP after EVD placement noted to be in the 120s now 68 treatment complicated by aneurysm rerupture after admission and increased volume of blood although large volume of hemorrhage was seen on initial scan and no change in the patient&#39;s clinical exam on her scale was noted due to this rerupture.  Patient&#39;s exam and prognosis are poor giving extensor posturing lack of extraocular movements to doll&#39;s maneuver and weak pupillary reflex as well as cough and gag.  Follows no commands or instructions at this time with no spontaneous movement on ventilator set at 12 overbreathing at 14-16 at this time without any sedation.&#34; The family opted to discontinue any further treatment to include surgical intervention given the findings. The patient was given comfort care with son and daughter at the bedside. The patient was extubated and expired at 1545h on 2/13/2021.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

                                                pulmonary edema; Low heart rate; chest pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. An 80-years-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in left arm on 28Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 Immunisation. Medical history included dementia, high blood pressure, COVID prior vaccination. He had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included diltiazem hydrochloride (CARDIZEM), anastrozole (ARIMIDEX), simvastatin and lorazepam. Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 07Jan2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 Immunization. There was no other vaccine received in four weeks. The patient experienced pulmonary edema, low heart rate and chest pain on 26Feb2021. The events resulted in hospitalization and patient died. The patient was hospitalized from 26Feb2021 for 1 day. Treatment received for the events included Epinephrine, morphine, nitroglycerine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid test Nasal Swab post vaccination on 26Feb2021 indicated Negative. The patient died on 26Feb2021. An autopsy was not performed.  information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pulmonary edema, low heart rate, and chest pain, all reported as fatal, are deemed unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine, being rather accidental occurrences, likely favored by the patient&#39;s age and by the mentioned high blood pressure, known risk factor for  cardiovascular diseases.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Low heart rate; pulmonary edema; chest pain

                                                My Husband and I received the same day a strong pain in our left arms. The next day my husband complained about pain in his entire body and weakness, and I had the same.  In the evening he collapsed falling out of his wheelchair.  He tried for an hour to sit down back in his wheelchair with my help, but he couldn&#39;t.   He agreed that I call 911.  Two nurses took him to Emergency Room at Hospital and didn&#39;t allow me to go with him.  In the morning on Saturday, he was transferred to Room at Hospital and the next day to the Intensive Care Room, where he sadly passed away on Tuesday April 13 at 4:22 am.

Pt presented to hospital on 04/28 w/ complaints of nausea and vomiting. He stated that he had recently gotten his COVID vaccine. Pt was found to be in acute liver failure in the ED w/ AST and ALT &gt; 1000. Lactate &gt; 15.0. BMP showed AKI on CKD and BG &gt;500. Pt did have cardiac arrest while undergoing CT Scan and ROSC was achieved after CPR x 20 mins.  Pt was hence transferred to the ICU for higher level management and admitted for cardiac arrest and acute liver failure.   Upon arrival, Pt was intubated and sedated. He was non-responsive to verbal and physical stimuli. Pt was acidotic. ABG: 6.99 / 28 / 165 / 7. 1 amp of HCO3 was given upon arrival. Pt was started on insulin gtt for DKA and was started on Levophed for low BP.  Pt underwent cardiac arrest shortly after arrival to the ICU. CPR was performed for &gt; 20 mins without ROSC. Family arrived at bedside and decision was made to stop CPR at 0205 on 04/29/2021.

From H&amp;P &#34;He reports that he woke up this morning and then subsequently started developing left-sided chest discomfort, it was pleuritic in nature.  It is sometimes worse with position.  He traveled to the Emergency Room where he was found to be mildly hypoxemic.  He underwent workup to include a CT angiogram, which revealed multiple predominantly small peripheral bilateral pulmonary emboli with borderline dilation of the main pulmonary artery and slightly greater than 1:1 right to left ratio.  He subsequently was felt to be appropriate for admission because of his underlying hypoxemia.  He denies any unilateral weakness or stroke symptoms.  He does have a patent foramen ovale.  He also reports no history of calf discomfort.  With the exception of being sedentary because of the pandemic, he has not traveled anywhere in a car or in a plane in the last 6-12 weeks.&#34; treatment: enoxaparin 1mg/kg SQ Q12h starting 4/25 @1659, changed to apixaban 10 mg PO Q12h 4/26 at 1756.

                                                Patient was in his usual state of health and independent with his ADLs until 2-3 days after his 2nd COVID vaccination on Feb 26th when he began to have bilateral knee and LE pain.  He then was having difficulty walking for a couple of weeks. The leg pain was not constant, but he did fatigue easily with walking.  On 3/11 he had his lower dentures placed and that evening/early morning of 3/12 he apparently fell. Patient does not remember anything about the fall - he cannot recall when he fell, how he fell, or any of his symptoms leading up to the fall.  Patient remembers being on the floor and attempting to get up but was too weak. He has rug burns on his forearms from attempting to get up.  He was hospitalized on 3/13 for dehydration, traumatic rhabdomyolysis, and w/u following fall.

A 80-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection,Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included bypass surgery. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Jan2021, the patient experienced headache, minor aches, had a cough, muscles were tightening, could hardly walk, lethargic, chills and heart attack on an unspecified date. Caller states that on 14Jan2021 she and her husband had the 1st Pfizer vaccine dose. 2nd dose was scheduled on 04Feb2021. Caller reporter that 2 days after the 1st dose, her husband&#39;s muscles were tightening, could hardly walk, had a cough, was lethargic, had chills and was c/o having reflux in his chest. Caller stated they had appointments that day with their Internist and their Cardiologist. Both HCPs felt all his symptoms were probably from the vaccine. That night she took him to the ER and he had had a heart attack. They did a cardiac Cath and had one of two stents put in. His kidneys were compromised and the HCP couldn&#39;t give the amount of dye needed to add another stent. So he still needs another stent. Also the blood count went down. Caller states her husband had cardiac bypass surgery years ago. The caller also mentioned her son is a surgeon and had bad flu like symptoms after second shot and only had a headache and minor aches after the first dose. She was concerned about her husband as he had a heart attack and if he should get the 2nd dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood count: went down. Outcome of the events were unknown.  Upon follow-up on 16Apr2021: This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

                                                My 81-year-old father, and my brother received the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at the  Hospital  on Wednesday January 13, 2021. Within a couple of minutes of them returning home, my father collapsed. As it turns out, he&#39;d had a silent heart attack. He is still in the medical center area Hospital this morning. A cardiologist who was filling in for my father&#39;s primary cardiologist thought maybe my father had a blockage and might have needed a stent. But when Dr. performed a cardiac catheterization,  he only found a little plaque. Medical personnel are not too sure what caused the heart attack. My was very dehydrated when he was admitted, and he has underlying health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, dementia and a history of blood clots. Those are just a few of his health issues. His primary cardiologist, Dr is back in town. He plans to see if my father has AFib before they release him. I believe Dr. an internist at Hospital,  said my father&#39;s INR on admitting was 1.2. My father&#39;s hematologist, Dr.,  had told us to let the person administering the vaccine know that my father is on blood thinners. I was not present when my father and brother received the vaccine, but I assume my brother passed that information on to them.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 15Jan2021 18:00 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL3249) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. He did fine right after, his arm wasn&#39;t sore, he felt fine. The next day he had nothing, no soreness, nothing, he felt great the next day. Dizziness started in the morning 17Jan2021 when he got up he said good morning and then said he would bring her back a cup coffee then he became very dizzy and leaned against the wall for support and then he fell, he was okay but he fell. He did go the emergency room because he fell and hit was head and it was bleeding. They told him it was not related to the vaccine but it is one of the things that are on the form that could happen. She says it was okay if it caused it she is just looking for a reason.  Now today (18Jan2021) he feels fine she wants to know what causes that side effect. She says she is supposed to be getting her vaccine too. He had one bad dizzy spell and then it went away, and she thinks he got kind of nauseous with it. It says this can happen, it said it could happen right after but in his case it did not, it happened within probably 34 hours or something. Outcome of the event dizziness has recovered completely at this point. Outcome of other events was unknown.

A 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283 and expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, intramuscular in left arm on 18Jan2021 13:10 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chicken pox, measles, and mumps (had chicken pox vaccine, measles, and mumps when he was younger, and he got the flu shot for flu). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The next day (19Jan2021) after receiving the injection, patient reported it was like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day. This went on for a couple of days before it improved. There was still a little bit in his left eye, but he can read and it has improved. He can see now and his eyes were improving. He found out that he had a stroke on 28Jan2021. He did not go to the hospital. He does not think the stroke affected anything else. He was supposed to have an MRI sometime this week. He went to the eye doctor and the eye doctor was the one that discovered the stroke and his eye doctor sent the report over to his primary office. He had a vision field test which was how the stroke was diagnosed. He was taking a baby aspirin and he will be put on a blood thinner called Plavix. He has not started Plavix yet, he has to go pick it up. Outcome of the event stroke was unknown while the other events was recovering.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

When I got my doctor&#39;s my blood pressure was high, the top number was 210 I do not remember the bottom now. He said I needed to get over to the ER clinic as soon as possible which is joined to my doctor&#39;s hospital. When I made it to the ER the blood pressure was 240 now. They to put on blood pressure monitoring, EKG. They gave my a chest x-ray. Cat-scan , blood work and gave me something in my IV.  I went home that about 9:30 PM  that night. My blood pressure was 213/99 and started my new medicine Nifedipine 30 MG . The ER Doctor told me to schedule an appointment with my doctor ASAP. The appointment was scheduled for today but was canceled as my doctor&#39;s office still has no power and was rescheduled for Monday the 22nd.  Prior to receiving the vaccine I have no had high blood pressure. I was feeling anxious once I was informed that  my blood pressure was dangerous high.

I was called to look at patient and they had already placed him in a chair and he was alert but weak and was able to answer questions coherently. His son that was with him call EMS to come.  I called the son later in the day to see how everything was going and the son said that EMS told him all vitals were normal and he did not go with them.  He then told me that his dad and him were having dinner at the time I called and that he felt fine. He also said his dad did not have breakfast that morning which could have contributed to it since he had T2DM.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right shoulder on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, stage 3 renal failure (was not bad, was in stage 5 couple of years ago, was a month or so away from full failure, was in the hospital and had dialysis, was able to get reversed with medication and diet), high blood pressure, and blood cholesterol increased/high cholesterol. The reporter stated that with regards to patient&#39;s height, he shrunk a little. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, didn&#39;t get flu shots. Concomitant medications include about 12 other unspecified drugs, takes statins, has high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Patient started experiencing pain behind his left knee about 6 or 7 days later in Mar2021 (also reported as 04 or 05Apr2021, pending clarification). By that Sunday, it had gotten worse. The leg swelled and was also having foot swelling because blood flow wasn&#39;t there. There was no TIA&#39;s no stroke, no heart racing, no sweating, was all pain. Got leg up and kept elevated until they could get to the doctor and get imaging. Patient went Monday 08Mar2021 to see the doctor. Patient was brought to the doctor and was then sent to the imaging place. Radiology read the imaging around 5:15pm on the Monday, 08Mar2021. The radiologist said there was 2.5&#34; blood clot behind the left knee. He had never had a blood clot before. Patient was then sent to the Emergency Room at (Name) Hospital, in (Name) where they live. Was kept there several hours. Did a lot more blood tests. He was immediately put on 10mg ELIQUIS 10mg, once in the morning, and once at night. He is now taking 5mg Eliquis in the morning, and 5mg at night. He has not had any of these problems before the Pfizer shot. The reporter knew that not a lot had been reported. It seemed it should be safe. The correlation and timing having the shot on 23Feb2021 and all of a sudden a week and a half later this happened. It was 10 days later. There was nothing they can do about it. Just continuing with the ELIQUIS, trying to dissolve the blood clot, will be staying on it for 4 to 6 months. It was a pretty big blood clot and were worried about it breaking up and traveling. The patient had no other symptoms, had a sore arm, that was it. Patient going back to (Name) 01Jun2021 and he will have another CT scan or ultra sound when they get back. The reporter did not want to need to get the leg amputated. Patient was only in the ER, was not admitted to the hospital. Patient was concerned because of his age. If it doesn&#39;t dissolve, they know there will be a lot more trouble. The event of pain left knee, blood clot and sore arm required a visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 on 01Apr2021 (lot number: ER8730) in the right arm. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Patient developed chest pain late March.  Duration of 1-2 days.  No medical follow-up.  Patient developed chest pain and difficulty breathing 26 Apr.  He reported to a facility like Urgent Care.  HCP recommended CXR which revealed questionable findings.  HCP recommended hospital visit but patient did not go that day.  Instead patient called ambulance to home the next morning and was transferred to the local hospital. Chief complaint chest pain and difficulty breathing.  Bloodwork ruled out myocardial infarction.  Various other assessments done over the first three days of hospitalization, including a CT scan which purportedly showed about a pulmonary emboli.  Most (if not all) of the emboli were in the right lung and were small and fixed/immobile.  At least one was larger.   Patient was started on heparin .  Echocardiogram workup ruled out presence of DVT in the legs.  Patient was discharged after 13-14 days in the hospital.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose, lot number and expiration date unknown, via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was admitted with pulmonary embolism and Covid 19 PCR positive (Igg also positive) with chest x-ray consistent with Covid pneumonia, 2 weeks after the 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject product contributed to the events. The reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.  Pulmonary embolism is known to be a potential complication of COVID 19 infection, including COVID 19 associated pneumonia.   There is limited information provided in this report. Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including pulmonary angiogram, VQ scan and coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This consumer reported the same events for himself and two other patients. This is the first of three cases.   An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose on 04Mar2021 and first dose on 27Jan2021 (batch/lot numbers not reported); both via unspecified routes of administration as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medications were not specified and reported that they were too many to list, also he has quite a list of prescription. The patient stated since he has gotten both COVID shots and it was found out after going to the doctor and to a cardiologist that he was the third person that has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation from taking the COVID shots and since he was the third person that they had recently after both shots, he thought he should call the toll number and report side effects after taking the vaccine. Consumer confirmed the date for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation as 08Mar2021 and stated primary care doctor, he went for his quarterly visit and she gave him an EKG and it showed this the fibrillation and he was immediately sent to a cardiologist who confirmed it after a second EKG and echocardiogram had both of those. Consumer stated it said atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy and mixed hyperlipidemia whatever that was, he has a print out of the diagnosis from the cardiologist in his hand. Consumer stated date of test was yesterday, 08Mar2021. Consumer stated he was given a new medicine Eliquis 5 mg twice a day as treatment. Consumer stated he just wanted to report this, since the doctor yesterday told him that he was the third patient that had both shots and came back with this. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                After my father received the second COVID vaccination he started complaining of headaches.   He had lung cancer, but he was in good condition.   Within weeks his health deteriorated and when we bought him for a scan the beginning of March he had two small brain bleeds.   The cancer had spread to the brain and he had a mass.    They put a shunt in on March 18th because they said he had fluid, and this was the only treatment.   Ten days later he was back in the hospital and after a week we had to take him home on hospice.   I think the vaccine could of escalated his cancer this rapidly.  Especially because he had two brain bleeds.

On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose.

An 83-year-old male (also age at vaccination) patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right (reported as Right upper arm) on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported that &#34;I have had one stent and one angioplasty done. Stent was done last year in 2020 and angioplasty was done in &#39;1990&#39; (not confirmed).&#34; The patient also added &#34;I gained a bunch of weight when I had my thyroid removed.&#34; The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date for Covid-19 immunization. For the concomitant medication the patient stated, &#34;Yes, I am taking medications.&#34; (specified medications not reported/ provided). It was reported by the patient that, &#34;I got this, my second COVID-19 Vaccine shot Saturday morning. All day Saturday (27Feb2021), all day Sunday and most of Monday, I was so sick, I didn&#39;t realize what was going on. Yesterday (02Mar2021), I ended up in the emergency room because I was having some problems with chest pain. So, I presume this is all connected to the second shot I got.&#34; It was added by the patient, &#34;I am asking question. About an hour or less than an hour ago I woke up, and my whole body felt like it was itching. I mean my whole body was just feeling funny. I was itching all over, that went away, I took a pill a while ago for that. &#39;Lorazepam&#39; (not confirmed over the call), it&#39;s a nerve, anxiety pill and it kind of helped. But right now, my feet are numb and cold.&#34; For the laboratory test the patient stated that, &#34;Yes they did a lab test on me yesterday (02Mar2021) as I went to the emergency room with some heart problems. They did blood work, that&#39;s all they did.&#34; The patient reported for the results, &#34;They said everything was fine.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient explained that &#34;No, I didn&#39;t take any medication for that.&#34; However treatment was received for Whole body felt like itching, whole body was just feeling funny.

A contactable physician (anesthesiologist) reported that an 83-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Mar2021, the patient developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after getting or receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The physician would like to know the protocol of that. The patient got his vaccination, on Thursday before the reporting (25Mar2021). And the patient was admitted to the hospital 48 hours later on Saturday (27Mar2021) with acute bleeding and thrombocytopenia. The patient went to the hospital with uncontrollable bleeding that did not stop. The physician was interested if the company had any internal protocol for treatment of ITP occurring acute onset after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The physician was trying to get some information to help some rheumatologist who can&#39;t seem to be finding things on the information on treating this. The physician was not here to blame anybody for it and from what he/she read, there are like 150 cases around the world with thrombocytopenia after the COVID-19 vaccine from totally different manufacturers (further clarification unknown). The physician had read a many couple case reports of different individual, people have tried for that but he/she was just interested if the company had any inhouse information for the treatment protocols for acute thrombocytopenia after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product BNT162B2 and the reported event Immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

An 83-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), intramuscular administered on arm left on 08Feb2021 08:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269; Expiration Date: 02Feb2021) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation (AFib) and he had maybe once or twice a week but never felt it (before Pfizer shot), ongoing hypertension, and Meniere&#39;s disease which had attacks several times a year  and since he lost his hearing in his right ear the attacks were minor (he felt a little nauseous, similar to having a minor hang over and with a louder than normal ringing in his right ear -tinnitus). Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for atrial fibrillation from 2016 (reported as 5 years ago) and ongoing; and hydrochlorothiazide (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) taken for hypertension from 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) and ongoing. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Before the shots, he had an AFib attack maybe once or twice a week never felt it. He mentioned that the only way he knew he had it was using his fitness watch and take his pulse before several times a day (unknown results) and before he exercise (he will not exercise if he was in Afib  but it always went away overnight). His doctor recommends staying hydrated and will see a cardiologist if it does not stabilize. After his first vaccine shot on 21Jan2021  06:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EK9231) intramuscular administered on arm left and while he was at his car, the was in Afib which lasted for 5 days (26Jan2021) which was unprecedented. After about five days, his pulse stabilized and was back to normal having AFib again maybe only once a week (AER 2021194945). Then, the patient received the 2nd dose on 08Feb2021.  By 08:45, the patient was in AFib again for five days (13Feb2021) when it cleared but then it came back almost immediately for another two days and he was not back to normal even after 7 days. The patient also had Meniere&#39;s attack the same time (08Feb2021 08:45) with the Afib he had. He was little lightheaded and get winded very easily during that time and recovered by 13Feb2021 (same time with the Afib). The event of Afib noted on 08Feb2021 was persistent/Significant disability/Incapacity and did not received any treatment.   No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

She says that she believes he had a side effect for it, and also he was rescheduled for his second dose. She says his second dose was supposed to be in 21 days but they rescheduled him for it at 18 days instead. She says he got the first dose on 11Jan, and they rescheduled his next for the 29th. She says she wanted to know if this was correct or ok. The reporter says that the following day he ended up having massive diarrhea, that it caused him while he was on the commode to pass out and he fell and hit his face, the best she can tell he was alone at the time. She says he did not go to the hospital for that, he got up and cleaned himself off and took a nap, and the nurse next door checked on him later on. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Heart stopped; Could not swallow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s wife). An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

In the morning of 27Jan2021 at 6 am his blood pressure was 156/74, with 65 beats, then, at 7am, it was 167/76, with 65 beats and at 8:40 am, his blood pressure was 137/64, with 65 beats, so it was fluctuating. At the time of the report the events had not resolved yet.

                                                No adverse effects for the first two weeks.  The morning of 2/7/21 he claimed he was not able to sleep the night before.  He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                85 year old male who presents with 2 episodes loose black stools, weakness, decreased appetite, increased lethargy and subjective fever today, 02/22.  Again admitted and had further rheumatological and infectious work up with negative results  He was initially admitted to Hospital on 02/12 with fatigue, atypical chest pain, melena. He had received 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02/10. He was hospitalized from 02/12-02/15 and  thought to have viral pericarditis.  Diagnosis at discharge: SIRS DUE TO NONINFECTIOUS PROCESS W ACUTE ORGAN DYSFUNCTION.   He was started on celebrex in addition to the the colchicine as an anti-inflammatory.  After initiation of the anti inflammatory medications, patient&#39;s fever resolved, he started feeling better and his inflammatory markers decreased.  He was monitored for another days and was feeling better.  He is therefore being discharged home.  In view of the negative work up, there is suspicion that these may be a hyper inflammatory response to the COVID vaccine since his symptoms were temporally related.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

An 85-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 09Feb2021 (Lot Number: EM9810) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2, at the age of 85-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 20Jan2021 (lot number: EL3302) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and experienced Vertigo, felt peculiar, nausea, dizziness/swimmy headed. The patient previously received the flu shot for immunization and experienced Sore arm. He is 85 and not familiar with all the goings on today but heard a report the other day and did not know there was such a thing as Vertigo. He thought that was just a movie. When he took the shot at (place name) in (county name) on 20Jan2021, soon thereafter, not that day but maybe next, he felt peculiar. It was just uneasiness and he did not feel right. That went on and on 09Feb2021, he got second shot and he got swimmy headed, but it has continued on since then and probably gotten worse, especially when he gets up in the morning. He has to hold on until he gets balanced or coordinated. It just doesn&#39;t seem right After he gets up and gets going, it is not as prevalent. But then sometimes it strikes him and he is just completely out of it. He later stated the peculiar feeling and swimmy headedness started the same day as the first injection, but he just did not really pay attention to it and thought it was just one of those things that you accept with getting older. Wife and he both went and he thought his feelings were merely from excitement or depletion or exhaustion. He felt like he had weakness and he just felt different. He got it at noon and waited for 15 minutes. Because of the events around him at the time, it did not register with him because it was the stress of driving 30 miles through expressway. Old people aren&#39;t used to driving that far. It got worse after the second shot and then he really knew something was wrong. When you are old, you have these feelings and pains and aches and all that stuff, and you just accept it as being old. It did not register with him until a couple of weeks ago when he heard it on TV about Vertigo and he said that is what he has. The swimmy headedness was really more noticeable after second shot, it brought it on stronger. He does not complain about things and thought it may just be getting old. He said it just kept on and getting a little worse and worse. Then he said something is not right and one day he bent over to look up and almost blacked out because of sensation in equilibrium or vision or whatever. He got scared and that was a couple of weeks ago. (name) was not cognizant of what was going on until he heard on television about Vertigo. One of the news channel mentioned or somebody mentioned it. It was just general things. He confirmed it was regarding someone who had gotten Vertigo after getting the vaccine but did not have a particular person to report on. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required. The outcome of the event dizziness aggravated and Weakness was not recovered, other events was unknown.

                                                The day after the 2nd shot, patient developed blisters on his lips and mouth. The care facility said that he had a nut allergy -- but he had never been allergic to nuts. He stopped eating and drinking and his BP had dropped to 60/40. By Jan 16th they called to say he was dying and he passed away on 1/18/21.  Patient had COVID19 from Oct 29th - early November. By Nov 21st he had lost 40 lbs. He was 6&#39;3&#34; and had gone from 189lbs to 149 lbs with COVID. By Nov 21st when we could visit, he had recovered from COVID, but was very thin and weak. He could not bathroom alone and kept falling.  He didn&#39;t seem to have a bad reaction to the 1st COVID shot, But he immediately reacted to the 2nd shot and passed away within 6 days.

                                                Two nosebleeds; Heart skipped all day long; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 86-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EU9231, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for prevention; apixaban (ELIQUIS), oral from an unspecified date at 2.5 mg twice daily for thromboembolism prophylaxis; and ranolazine (RANEXA), oral from an unspecified date at 500 mg twice daily for an unspecified indication.  Medical history included bypass surgery in 2007, stent placement (5 stents), and 3 blocked arteries, diagnosed several years ago, he guesses he is living on half of them.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient received his first shot of COVID vaccine on 22Jan2021. The patient then experienced two nosebleeds, they did not ask if he had been on a blood thinner, he takes Eliquis, 2.5mg and Ranexa, so his question is a couple days, his heart skips beats anyway, but on the 13th day, it skipped all day long, so he was concerned about the other shot, he was supposed to get it today, he was concerned because he had bypass surgery, had 5 stents, 3 blocked arteries now that they can&#39;t do anything about. He was calling about COVID vaccine. He took it 3 weeks ago today and was supposed to get second shot. Concerned as to whether or not he should take it. He was supposed to get the second shot today (12Feb2021), doesn&#39;t know, but was really concerned about whether he should take or not. Nosebleeds were the 13th day after the shot (on 04Feb2021). He has recovered completely from nosebleeds. He stated he only bled for a couple seconds. Heart skipped all day long the 13th day after taking the shot (on 04Feb2021), states it is doing fine at this time, comes and goes, may skip one day, next day maybe 3 times and skip, then 4 times and skip, he guesses he has a crazy heart. The patient recovered from the event two nosebleeds on unspecified date, while unknown outcome for the remaining event. The action taken in response to the events for apixaban and ranolazine was unknown.   Additional information was also received by Pfizer from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (manufacturer control number: US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY-BMS-2021-016064), license party for Apixaban.   This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of EPISTAXIS (Two nosebleeds) and EXTRASYSTOLES (Heart skipped all day long) in 86-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) tablet for Thromboembolism prophylaxis. CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included ranolazine (Ranexa) tablet for an unknown indication and Covid-19 Vaccine injection for Prevention. The patient&#39;s past medical history included Bypass surgery in 2007, Stent placement and Arterial occlusion. On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (Oral), 2.5 milligram twice a day and Ranexa (Oral), 500 milligram twice a day. On 22-Jan-2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (unknown route) by injection once to left shoulder. On 04-Feb-2021, an unknown time after starting Eliquis, the patient experienced EPISTAXIS (Two nosebleeds) and EXTRASYSTOLES (Heart skipped all day long). The action taken with Eliquis(Oral) was unknown. At the time of the report, EPISTAXIS resolved and EXTRASYSTOLES outcome was unknown. For Eliquis(Oral), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments. Nosebleeds were the 13th day after the shot. He took shot on 22Jan2021. Has recovered completely from nosebleeds. States he only bled for a couple seconds. Heart skipped all day long the 13th day after taking the shot, states it is doing fine at this time, comes and goes, may skip one day, next day maybe 3 times and skip, then 4 times and skip, he guesses he has a crazy heart.

An 86-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 08Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib) and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient was taking loads of medications. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and reported that he had no problems with the first dose. The patient experienced severe left arm pain at the arm where the shot was given on 08Mar2021, the night after he received his second COVID vaccine dose. He almost called a number because he thought he was having a heart attack. What he did was he got up to walk around and the pain went away and when he sat down on his recliner, the pain came back so he didn&#39;t get much sleep that night. He was fine the next day. The patient took an ASPIRIN 325 mg coated pill because he thought he might be having a heart attack. If he had known, he would have taken the vaccine on his right arm. His arm hurt the night of 08Mar2021 until 6:00 AM the following day. The patient then stated that his recommendation was to tell the people who are administering the shot that a left arm pain may possibly occur because anybody who has the left arm hurting is afraid and can think they have a heart attack. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 09Mar2021 at 06:00 AM, and recovered on 09Mar2021 for all other events.

                                                Increased blood pressure; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 87-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1288 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left shoulder, on 14Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, atrial fibrillation, and cholesterol. Concomitant medication included omeprazole, apixaban (ELIQUIS), and atorvastatin. Patient previously took pneumonia vaccine. On Jan2021, patient noticed an increased blood pressure (usually his BP is around 120, now has consistently been around 150). Prior to the shot, he has not been on blood pressure medication. His blood pressure usually runs high 120s to 130s on the top, and mid 50-60 on the bottom. His blood pressure prior to the vaccine that day was 132/56. Then a couple of days after the first shot, the top number of his blood pressure was in the high 150s, but the same on the bottom. Patient was wondering if he has a problem, or is this a side effect. He went in as a senior. He didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. The blood pressure difference started a couple of days after his first shot. He was scheduled for his second shot 4Feb2021. He has had no other side effects or anything. There was no swelling, no fever, no chills and he felt good. Just his blood pressure has been an issue. Outcome of the event was not recovered.

An 87-year-old male received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 19Jan2021 at 16:00 at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 87-year-old. Lot number was EL3249. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, by-pass surgery in 1999 then high blood pressure in 1999, gout (diagnosed before 1999, it was an on and off thing, he had flare ups, the last one was at Christmas time), High cholesterol (diagnosed in 2000 or 2001), diabetes, anemia. Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) in 2014 for atrial fibrillation. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine in Sep2020 for immunization. On 20Jan2021, the patient was anemic. On 21Jan2021 at 02:30, nose bled. The patient just kept wiping his nose for thirty minutes before it stopped. On 20Jan2021, hemoglobin resulted 12.6, hematocrit was 3.9. The patient went to the hematologist the day before the report who said the patient was low on iron, hemoglobin and hematocrit were low, so he had to get an iron infusion the day of report for that (the patient went every three months and if his iron was low he got an infusion). The patient recovered from nose bled on 21Jan2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                This patient received a Covid-19 vaccination on 1/28 at his post-acute skilled nursing facility. He began having fevers and low oxygenation the next day. He was brought to Hospital ED, tested positive for coronavirus, and was admitted to the hospital with Covid-19.  I do not know what brand or lot vaccine the patient received. The SNF should have those records.

He became pale, lethargic, diaphoretic, incontinent of urine, and collapsed onto his walker.  A rapid response was called.  Blood pressure on arrival by team  was  50&#39;s/30&#39;s, and fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride 500 mL was initiated while in transit to the ED.  Approximately 20 minutes later the patient&#39;s had stabilized but remained appropriately alert.

The next day the leg weakness was more significant and went to the emergency room where they found greater weakness in the left leg than the right leg. An MRI showed &#34;Punctate focus of diffusion restriction within the left cerebellar vermis consistent with acute infarct.&#34; He was also found to have a critically low platelet level of 30 and then 27 while in the emergency room. He was then admitted to the hospital, placed on steroids to increase his platelet level and given physical therapy following the stroke. He was admitted to the hospital for a total of 3 nights. He was discharged home on Aspirin, Carvedilol, and Atorvastatin, has follow up with hematology to check platelets and physical therapy.

                                                The patient was admitted to the hospital on 4/25 c/o fatigue, hypoglycemia, and poor oral intake. He also complained of shortness of breath, which was an indication for a COVID-19 test. The specimen was collected and came back positive on 4/25. After a day at the hospital, the patient developed increased shortness of breath, had 80% oxygen saturation on a non-rebreather mask with subsequent upgrade to BiPap, and was using accessory muscles of respiration. His CXR on 4/25 on admission showed patchy b/l infiltrates. CT confirmed findings of CXR and was found to have ground glass opacities. The patient&#39;s ABG showed hypoxemia. On the morning of 4/27, the patient was found to be severely hypoxic and was electively intubated. As this form is being filled out, the patient is in the ICU on a ventilator due to COVID-19 pneumonia.

Hospital Course:   COVID-19 pneumonia.  The patient was treated with convalescent plasma and IV remdesivir and completed the course.  He was treated initially with IV Decadron which has been transitioned to oral tablets for discharge to complete a 10-day course.   Chronic systolic heart failure.  Coronary artery disease.  Orthostatic hypotension in the setting of chronic hypertension.  The patient does have chronic systolic heart failure with an EF around 20% and is followed closely at the heart failure clinic.  He is chronically prescribed Lasix at 80 mg twice daily, however he did have some episodes of orthostatic hypotension during his hospitalization and has been unable to tolerate other guideline directed medical therapy due to his hypotension.  He is euvolemic at this time.  I have decreased his Lasix dosing to 40 mg twice daily to restart tomorrow morning.  His last dose of the 80 mg of Lasix was yesterday morning.  I do feel that in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased oral intake that he is more at risk for continued hypotension and dehydration aggressive diuresis.  He will remain on aspirin, Plavix, and simvastatin.   Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His last hemoglobin A1c showed good control at 6.3 on 3/3/2021.  His glipizide was held while inpatient.  He was on long-acting Lantus insulin 10 units with stable blood sugars in the hospital.  He was also on correctional lispro insulin.  His glipizide will be resumed upon discharge.

Before the vaccine, there was no problem with my heart rate.  Now, I am taking Labeatol 4 times a day to keep rate at least at 90.  This vaccine has doubled my heart rate.  It was 70 before the vaccine.  Now if I do not take my Labetalol, it goes up to 140.  Because my body is working so hard with that heart rate, it is making my sugar low.  So now I&#39;m taking less insulin and this whole situation is getting confusing on how to handle this long term, adverse reaction to the Pfizer vaccine.

                                                The weeks following vaccination, the patient felt lethargic, dizzy, unstable on his feet. Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

                                                My Father had been in his usual state of health when he received his first Pfizer Covid-19 shot on 1/12/2021 and his second dose on 2/2/2021.  He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.  He had another episode of lethargy/unresponsiveness on 2/26/2021 and was once again sent to the hospital where they did not show any new findings.  He spent a few days in the hospital before returning to his facility where he continued to have periodic episodes of increased lethargy/confusion and decreased eating.  He was placed on Hospice and passed away on March 29th.

An 89-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot/batch number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the arm on 14Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included unspecified blood thinners. The consumer is a veteran and had the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine first dose yesterday on 14Jan2021. He had it in his arm and got a print-out that he took out and it says something about if you have a bleeding disorder and are on blood thinners. His provider did not ask him. He wanted to know if this vaccine is a blood thinner. He felt good after getting it and went to sleep last night. He got up and sort of hack up from lungs to spit out and it was blood and was like that from 6am-7am on 15Jan2021. It was also reported that he was spitting a blood about seven or eight times but then it stopped. He is okay now. Nothing is happening. He wanted to know if he should take a blood thinner when he gets the second one. He would feel like he should not take the blood thinner when he gets the second one. The outcome of the event was recovered on 15Jan2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Got first dose of COVID shot wed.. A&amp;Ox1. Has left sided weakness from prior CVA  History of Present Illness     89-year-old male who presents to the ER via EMS with confusion.  He has also reportedly had a cough and some fever.  There has been some report of incontinence of both bowel and bladder.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 3/17.  He and his wife have returned to the home after wintering in another state.  According to his wife, with whom I have spoken this evening, last night he suddenly became confused.  The confusion continued throughout the day today, thus prompting the EMS called to the house and the subsequent journey to the ED for further evaluation.   In the ER this evening, a battery of testing was completed.  A Covid swab is indeed positive.  His wife is uncertain of any positive contacts.  He had some vascular congestion on chest x-ray.  He has a prior history of pleural effusion which is thought to be resolved.  He does have a history of lower extremity edema.  He had some urinary incontinence and his wife held his Lasix Saturday morning.  He was noted to be slightly hypoxic around 88% on room air.  He was around 85% or so on room air at home with their home pulse oximeter device.  He has been placed on 2 L of nasal cannula.

                                                Shortness of breath; bradycardia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. An 89-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6200), intramuscular in left arm on 24Feb2021 12:00 PM (received at the age of 89-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within the four weeks prior to receiving BNT162B2. Medical history included known COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), hypertensive heart, CKD 3 (chronic kidney disease stage 3), and history of breast cancer. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. He had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included multiple unspecified medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EL9265), intramuscular in left arm on 02Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that the patient developed shortness of breath (SOB) and bradycardia 3 days after vaccination, on 27Feb2021. 1 day after that, 28Feb2021, it worsened, and the patient was admitted with SOB and bradycardia. Has known COPD, not on any negative chronotropic medication. The patient was cleared after a day in the hospital. The reported adverse events resulted in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit and hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days (28Feb2021 to 02Mar2021). As corrective treatment, the patient received oral steroid. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date. The patient underwent Covid test post vaccination: Nasal Swab on 28Feb2021 with result of negative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 89-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 12:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included vascular dementia; hypertension; hypothyroidism; malignant melanoma of back (resected/in remission); bladder cancer (surgery in Nov2018/in remission); prediabetic; chronic kidney disease stage 3 due to hypertension; and sleep related hypoxia. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included donepezil taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; memantine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; levothyroxine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lisinopril taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lovastatin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; fluoxetine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and unspecified multivitamin tablet. The patient previously received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19) on 26Feb2021 07:45 PM in the left arm for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has not received other vaccine in four weeks. The first day after the shot, there were not any adverse reactions. The next morning at approximately 11:00 am, the reporter found patient laying on the floor next to his bed, eyes glazed over, disoriented, and he said &#34;he felt funny&#34;. The reporter got him sitting up leaning on the side of the bed and called. The EMT&#39;s came and checked his vitals. Within half an hour from  finding the patient laying on the floor, he seemed almost back to normal. However, since he is 89 years old, the patient was transported by ambulance. Blood was drawn, a urine sample was taken, a chest Xray, and a CT scan of his head and his spine were the labs that were run. All the labs came back normal. However, once patient got home after being in the ER for 5 hours, he is very weak, can barely stand and barely walk without human assistance and his walker. The way he is acting is more like he had a stroke. Onset of the events reported as 20Mar2021 11:15 AM. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient used walker due to can barely stand and barely walk; for other events, there was no treatment given. The patient was not diagnosed of Covid prior vaccination and has not been tested for Covid post vaccination.
