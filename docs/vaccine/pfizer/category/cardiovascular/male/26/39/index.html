A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly in unknown arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for routine mass immunizations (covid-19 immunization). The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Not a military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none and concomitant medications was none (he was on no other medications). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced tachycardia, intermittent palpitations, low grade fever/fever all started somewhere in the morning of 18Dec2020 and muscle aches on 17Dec2020. Physician assessed tachycardia and intermittent palpitations as serious due to medically significant. Physician stated that one of his workers had the vaccine and proceeded to have tachycardia and low grade fever. He would like to know if patient should get the second dose. The patient had mostly tachycardia with some intermittent palpitations. Patient was seen in his office on 18Dec2020, and got the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020. He also reported fever and muscle aches, although the fever was subjective and was not documented. Tachycardia improved and sent him to cardiology on 21Dec2020. It was not life threatening and they did an Electrocardiogram (EKG). His initial heart rate was 130. When he was seen again in their office on 21Dec2020, it was 93, which was baseline. It improved. He never got his temperature. The highest in office was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He had some muscle aches. The physician just sent patient to cardiology because he was having intermittent tachycardia and intermittent palpitations. Two visits to physician office. He was seen on 18Dec2020 and again on 21Dec2020. Relevant tests: they did testing for tachycardia but not related specifically. They did thyroid and EKG in office and he did not know if test were back. EKG was ok. The Thyroid, Complete blood count (CBC) and lipid (all were on an unknown date in Dec2020) were not back and were just done to make sure there were no cardiac issues. The outcome of the events was recovering.

I checked my HR on my smart watch and it said that around 12pm my HR was 157bpm which was right after getting the vaccine when I started walking home. My  resting HR is usually 47-52bpm. I am a very active person. I have been waking up in the middle of the night multiple times in night sweats and it feels like my heart is contracting very hard. I notice that my HR jumps up right when I start to be more active, but more than normal. On the 11th my average walking HR was 140. Today at work my HR was 134 at the highest around 9am and the lowest was 56bpm around 7am when I was getting ready for work. Additionally to the increased HR I have SOB when I walk and talk. I did have a sore arm as well the first day, but nothing more than any other injection I have had before.

No measurement was ever taken to confirm it was in fact high. He also became flushed. He was wearing a sweatshirt, so when he took that off he was feeling better. This episode lasted for 5 hours. No comorbidities or other heart conditions. We asked if he was possibly dehydrated or had any caffeine that day. I determined to proceed with dose 2 under the request that he came back after 1 hour and 2 hours respectively to get vitals.

                                                I had normal covid vaccine sideffects throughout the night. Then around 8am my heart rate shot up in the 110 -120 bpm range. This remained at a high rate for several hours. In addition to this i was having severe heart palpitations. I ended up needing to go to urgent care where they gave me an iv of saline and beta blockers to slow my heart.

                                                27 year old male with Down&#39;s Syndrome and no other past medical history received second COVID-19 vaccine on 4/27/2021. On 4/30/2021 began &#34;feeling poorly&#34; with nausea/vomiting and possible chest discomfort. Originally presented to ED on morning of 4/30 - EKG completed demonstrated diffused ST elevation. Patient was transferred to Medical Center for heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries and LVEDP of 25. Stat ECHO demonstrated pericardial effusion and concern raised for myopericarditis. Patient subsequently transferred to a different Medical Center for higher level of care. Upon arrival to Medical Center plan was to intubate and take to cath lab for heart biopsy and PA catheter placement. However, upon intubation patient began to decompensate and subsequently developed cardiac arrest. During ACLS, VA ECMO was placed and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. Following VA ECMO placement patient received IVIG, high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg), anakinra 100 mg, and broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn). Despite these efforts the patient continued to have hemodynamic instability and was on high dose vasopressors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, angiotensin II, vasopressin). Patient subsequently suffered another cardiac arrest, briefly regained pulse with high dose vasopressors, but subsequently lost pulse despite best efforts and died on 5/1/2021 at approximately 13:00.

A 27-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EV8732/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 07Apr2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 27 years old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included COVID-19 on an unspecified date. The patient did not have any known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication (other medications taken in two weeks) were none.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 19Apr2021 at 22:00, the patient experienced similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down, Heart palpitations, left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck, low grade fever, severe fatigue and slightly dry cough. The events required a physician&#39;s office visit. The patient received treatment for these events. The clinical course of the events was as follows: Heart palpitations originating under left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck. Similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down, low grade fever, severe fatigue, and slightly dry cough. Lasted about 30 hours. Discomfort relief, like pericarditis, was only felt when sitting up and propping myself up by my arms leaning forward. Onset was rapid, occurring 13 days after the first dose of the vaccine over a period of 8 hours (palpitations came first, followed by shoulder and neck pain in the morning). Treated with Aspirin at first (low effectiveness) followed by NSAID Advil 7 hours later (high effectiveness, symptom relief was about 50%). High strength Advil recommended by MD. The outcome of the events was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

An ECHO was performed and LVEF was 45%, and an EKG showed possible ST elevation. Per the Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine study there were no reports of STEMI being an adverse effect. Given the patient&#39;s ejection fraction of 45%, there was likely a prior medical condition the patient was unaware of and may have precipitated the STEMI rather than the vaccine . Hospitalized for 2 days and diagnosed with pericarditis.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I felt palpitations around 10-12 minutes after the 1st Pfizer dose was given, and asked the Doctor to take my vital signs. I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

A 29-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EK4176) in the hospital, via intramuscular route on 10Feb2021 at 10:30 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from 2010 to 2011 and allergies to penicillin on an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination, was the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: H9899) in the hospital, via intramuscular route at 01:15 PM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that on 12Feb2021 at 08:00 PM (also reported as &#39;3 days after injection&#39;) the patient experienced flu-like symptoms that included fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, and a persistent headache. On 13Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 4th day&#39;, the patient developed pleurisy and difficulty breathing and had 2 syncope events the morning of 14Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 5th day&#39;). The patient was taken by ambulance and admitted to ER for further testing. It was determined that all symptoms likely related to the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine recently received. Pleurisy persists one week following vaccine dose. The patient went to the emergency room/department or urgent care due to the events. As treatment for the event, the patient was monitored and given IV fluids over 12 hour stay in CDU. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae (reported as recovered with lasting effects). The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile.

                                                After leaving the vaccination clinic following the 15 minute waiting period, I felt normal and ran a quick errand before returning to work. After completing the errand (roughly 15 minutes), I began driving back to my office (roughly 10 minute drive). As I was roughly 1/2 mile from the office, I started to feel slightly lightheaded/woozy. I continued to drive toward the office, and within a matter of a couple minutes or less, I was overcome with extreme disorientation and faintness. Before I could manage to return to the office or pull over to collect myself, I completely lost consciousness and crashed into another vehicle. Even after the crash, I was unconscious for roughly a minute or so until I finally came to and realized what had happened. It then took me another couple of minutes to collect myself and exit the vehicle to assess the situation and ensure all parties were alright. Police/Emergency services were contacted and a police report was filed. After the event, I remained slightly nauseated for approximately 3 hours and had intermittent chill episodes, but the adverse events have since subsided.

                                                I felt soreness and pressure build up in my arm starting a few hours after the receiving the dose. The soreness and pressure got progressively worse over the course of two days. It wasn&#39;t unbearable, just uncomfortable. The second day after the vaccine I had stretched my arm pretty good for minute, when I released the stretch I felt a rush of something for from my arm into my torso. I got really dizzy and passed out, my wife was in the room at the time and said I never closed my eyes; but I had completely blacked out. My wife had woken me up and I wasn&#39;t sure what had happened, it took me about 30 seconds to realize I had passed out after stretching that arm. My arm had felt better after waking up from passing out, and soreness had passed a couple days later. I didn&#39;t get checked out,  after I woke up I started feeling fine.  I&#39;m honestly not sure if it&#39;s directly related to the vaccine or not, I just thought I should let someone know just in case.

He fell from the bench to the floor where he landed on his stomach. When I ran over to him, his eyes were open but his body was limp. I tapped his back and asked if he was ok, and he was startled as if I woke him up from sleep. He was alert and was able to speak, he asked for water and I gave it to him. I asked of he wanted me to call emergency services but he declined. He then vomited in the waiting room trash can. His sister was with him and began to rub his back and fan him. I asked again if he needed to go to the hospital and again her declined. I told them to please wait in the lobby at least another 15 minutes before leaving and he did. I called to patient around 8pm to check on him and he said he was fine and had no more symptoms.

                                                After getting the vaccine in my left arm, I walked to observation area and sat down in chair. Within a minute or so, I noticed my heart rate was slightly elevated and had a strange feeling of unease. Roughly 3-5 minutes later symptoms appeared and I noticed my palms were sweating and I had slightly blurred vision. At this point, I called for a paramedic and told them I wasn?t feeling well. They arrived nearly 15 seconds later (paramedics were stationed all throughout observation area). Symptom severity dramatically increased (very blurred vision, feeling of something clearly being wrong) and was added by a ringing sound in both ears. I was helped into a wheel chair and rolled into an enclosed area with a curtain around for privacy. Gatorade was offered to me and I took a few sips and felt very mildly better. Paramedics reported that my blood pressure was extremely low (63/28). They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. Symptoms were the same and starting to very slightly get better from the Gatorade so I said let?s wait a few minutes to see how I feel. At this point they took my blood sugar measurement and found that it was also very low (53mg). They gave me some intravenous fluids and a glucose substance that was in a tube (sort of like toothpaste) and within another five minutes I felt considerably better. I received the IV treatment for roughly 20 minutes and symptoms progressively got better over the course of the treatment. My blood pressure went back up to 117/80 and my blood sugar went up to a more normal level as well (I believe they said somewhere in the 90s or low 100?s). After they removed the IV and blood pressure monitor, I rested for roughly 20 minutes before walking to my car and driving home.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

                                                I felt fine the rest of yesterday but started to feel really tired and worn down late last night. I took my sleeping pill like normal and went to bed. I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

The patient got the vaccine and was told to have a seat outside the immunization room for 15 minutes at least to ensure no side effects. The patient wanted to get something in the store. Pharmacist was immunizing the next patient already. Patient knocked on the door and stated he didn&#39;t feel good and was dizzy. I told him  to take a seat I was going to get him some water. As he was about to sit down he passed out and hit the door with his head. EMS was called and patient was taken to hospital. The patient woke up 30 seconds after and was dizzy. He felt better after about 5 minutes.

His blood pressure was then rechecked a few minutes later and it had come up to 102/60. His pupils constricted back to a normal size and he said he was feeling better. He was given water to drink, observed for 30 minutes and walked out to his car by an RN after 30 minutes of observation. He did report that he does this with all vaccines. He was driven home by another driver.

Approximately five minutes later he mentioned to his female colleague who was with him that he felt feverish and sweaty and when he reached over to get a drink from his water bottle he fell over and passed out for a few seconds.  By the time I ran out to check on him he was already getting up and I had him sit in the chair while my technician called 9-1-1.  The paramedics soon came out (I think it was about 10 minutes) and checked him out.  Both theirs and my IR thermometers showed a normal temperature.  His BP was normal according to the paramedics.  They asked some more questions and ultimately let him go home under his own power with his female cohort.

I laid down and called a  nurse adviser. I was recommended to go to ER, so my wife took me to ER. They did CT scan of my head, then CT scan of my head and neck with contrast, then MRI of my head, then MRI of my head and neck with contrast. It was confirmed that I had an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE. It was decided to perform carotid endarterectomy surgery to remove a clot in the neck carotid artery. The clot was removed.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 19Apr2021, this case now contains serious adverse reaction. Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) via Medical Information team. A 31-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were not reported) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was in excellent health and had no known allergies. The patient had took the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 18 days prior reporting (on 01Apr2021) and had blood pressure dropped to 70/50 and emergency medical services (EMS) was called an hour with him. The reporter was asking if the patient should take the second dose being that he had this reaction. The reporter further asked for the efficacy of one dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and how long was the coverage of the vaccine as far as needing a booster shot. The reporter also asked about the 6 months topline analysis results of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It was further reported that fifteen minutes after the COVID-19 shot on 01Apr2021, the patient passed out; the patient had a big blood pressure drop from 110/90 to 70/50. The EMS was called in and attended to the patient. The patient was there for about an hour. The reporter was just calling to find out if the patient could get the second shot. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                Fever, chills, headache, sore arm, swollen arm, lethargy, sensitive and sore skin. These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

Within 5-10 minutes he slumped in his chair and became unresponsive. Became responsive to voice but was slurring his words. Patient was diaphoretic. HR in 90s, O2 98%. His eyes rolled back in his head  suspecting vasovagal episode, we moved patient to the floor  and raised his legs. He became more responsive. Was fully oriented although did not seem incredibly alert. Cycled multiple BPs with 100s-110s/60s-70s. HR 70s-80s  supine, O2 sat 96-98%.  EMS was called for transport to ED given patient&#39;s lack of prompt recovery. We  attempted to sit patient up and he again became lightheaded and had to lie back down. While in supine position, remained with normal and stable VS. At no time did he manifest any rash, respiratory symptoms, throat or chest tightness,  abdominal discomfort, or other overt signs of anaphylaxis.   Patient was transported to the ED where ROS was reported as:   - CONST: &#43;fatigue, denies fevers or chills  - EYES: Denies vision changes  - ENT: Denies rhinorrhea, sore throat  - CV: Denies new chest pain  - RESP: Denies SOB or cough  - GI: Denies abd pain, n/v, diarrhea  - GU: Denies dysuria  - MSK: Denies new joint swelling or pain  - SKIN: Denies new lesions or rash  - NEURO: Denies new HA, numbness, or weakness  - PSYCH: Denies suicidal ideation Vitals: BP 116/67, O2 99% on RA, Temp: 97.7F, Pulse 79.  ED provider felt this was most likely vasovagal episode given occurrence following vaccine administration and associated sxs. EKG without evidence of dysrrhythmia. No PE risk factors, SOB or CP. Pt with HA that was not thunderclap nor severe in nature and was consistent with prior migranes, thus do ot suspect SAH. No hx to suggest anemia and no anemia on blood work today. No report of  seizure. Pt is alert without report of post-ictal period.

Relevant medical history included colitis ulcerative. Concomitant medications included mesalamine. On 31Jan2021 developed atrial fibrillation which is ongoing several months later. Treatment received included  metoprolol, sotalol.

I checked my Apple Watch and my resting heart rate was 156bpm. The nurse at the clinic than confirmed my heart rate as well as an elevated Blood Pressure. After remaining at the clinic for observation, my resting heart rate only dropped to 124bpm. At that time the nurse felt I should go to the ER for an evaluation. She escorted me to the ER where I was evaluated and released 5.5 hours later with nothing found. ER attending physician advised to get the 2nd dose but confirm with PCP. My PCP also advised to get the 2nd dose.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night with sever chills. My body was shaking uncontrollably. I took an ibuprofen and then took a 40 minute hot shower. My chest felt tight and I couldn?t catch my breath, so I called 911 for extra precaution. My vitals were good so I was advised to take ibuprofen and stay hydrated. This chills, achy body, headache lasted the whole day. Chills, headache, body aches. It wasn?t until about 48 hours after the shot that I began to feel better.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old patient (husband) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 05Apr2021 15:40 (Lot Number: ER8734) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atopic dermatitis. Concomitant medication included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), an injection that patient takes every other week to control his atopic dermatitis, he has been using this for 3 years at least. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER6207) in left shoulder on 15Mar2021 15:40, at the age of 32 years old, for COVID-19 immunization, and experienced arm sore and body aches. The patient experienced vomiting blood in Apr2021, blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up / spitting up blood in Apr2021, he feels like his throat is so raw on 05Apr2021, sore arm on 05Apr2021, feeling achy/ her husband is still sore/achy today on 05Apr2021, nauseous on 05Apr2021, vomiting/ throwing up on 05Apr2021, diarrhea on 05Apr2021, chilly in Apr2021, redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids; his pores looked red in Apr2021, fatigue on 05Apr2021. No treatment received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events pain in arm, ache, nauseous, erythema, fatigue was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Clinical course as reported: Her husband got their second dose of the vaccine on 05Apr2021. Her husband was having a more severe reaction than the first time. The first time he got the vaccine his arm was sore. Last night (05Apr2021), the caller&#39;s husband was vomiting just over and over and had diarrhea, both at the same time. Wife added the thing she was worried about was that her husband was vomiting blood as well, and that her husband said it was from the phlegm, like he felt like his throat was so raw. Her husband did not really want to eat anything which she expected was normal. She was trying to give him fluids, and having him drink a little bit. Her husband had not vomited since around 4 am. And right now, he was sleeping. She did not know if she should give him medicine or take him to be seen or if this was a normal reaction to the vaccination. She did read side effects from the paper and she saw that some vomiting was expected but the blood was what caught her off guard. Around 10 o&#39;clock last night (05Apr2021), her husband felt nauseous and went to bed. She actually fell asleep on the couch and heard her husband vomiting across the house, that was how bad the vomiting was. The vomiting started at midnight last night (05Apr2021). Her husband has been vomiting every couple of hours (2 hours), around the clock. Diarrhea had been at the same time. From her understanding, her husband had vomited at least 3 or 4 times, and had diarrhea 3 or 4 times. She kind of lost track after the 3rd time, but she had not heard him since around 4 am Her husband was still sore/achy today (06Apr2020) and was is still nauseous. She believed he was also feeling chilly. He was wrapped up in his blanket. Her husband did not have a fever, she has been checking his temperature. Wife stated no treatment yet, as she did not know what was safe. Her husband wanted to wait until he stopped vomiting because anything he put in his stomach came right back up. After the first time her husband was done throwing up, and was only dry heaving, he started to like kind of spit. When he would gargle or spit, there was blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up. The first time the wife went to check on him, she saw him spitting up blood. It was not like his vomit was red with blood in it, it was just the after effects, so she thought she should call and report this. Each time he has vomited, there was still that spit up of blood afterwards. The patient himself clarified the vomiting was last around 4 am (06Apr2020), give or take, and the last stool/bout of diarrhea was around 7 am (06Apr2020). He was still feeling nauseous and fatigued. He added that after the first time he vomited and the couple times he checked later on, he looked in the mirror and saw that there was this redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids. He adds it was red, it wasn&#39;t like splotchy, but it was like his pores looked red, like pinpoints. The patient clarified that the fatigue and achiness probably started around the first time he vomited, and that was still hanging around. The wife stated this was better than him getting Covid. Wife added what she was trying to see was if she should take her husband to the hospital or not. She did not want to wait too long, but if this was something that was a side effect that was expected, then her husband could just sleep it off.

He was not falling over but had to be very careful with his steps.; burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back; he felt off. It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux. He experienced some unusual side effects that were not listed on the web. His boss advised him to call. Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.   Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

A 34-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, Lot number EL0140, in Hospital, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 22Dec2020 (at 34 years of age) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prediabetes (glucose tolerance impaired) from an unknown date. The patient didn&#39;t have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included metformin and multivitamins. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced premature ventricular contractions, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, shortness of breath and chest pain. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care access and hospitalization as life threatening events. The patient was treated with diltiazem, fludrocortisone, aspirin and atorvastatin. He remained in hospital 2 days and then he was discharged. The patient underwent COVID-19 test (nasal swab) on 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 and both gave negative results. The patient had not recovered yet from the reported events at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events ventricular extrasystoles, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, dyspnea and chest pain cannot be excluded as the information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. The patient is a young adult with known prediabetes, but no other comorbidities reported. Information on tests done during admission, clinical course and working diagnosis would be helpful in further assessment of this case. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The fever, chills, headache, and general soreness subsided on 03/29/2021, but the periodic chest and arm pain persisted and continued to get worse. On 03/29/2021 I also had nausea/vomiting and sweating. On the morning of 03/30/2021 during an episode of chest and arm pain we went to the Emergency Department at. At the emergency department, they detected elevated troponin levels indicating damage to the heart muscle. I was rushed via ambulance for an emergency heart catheterization. I was admitted to the hospital and monitored while various other tests were performed. It was determined that there was inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis).

A 35-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. Caller stated that his close friend who was ER physician (front line worker) and within 24 hours after receiving the COVID vaccine, developed COVID or symptoms of COVID. Patient received the COVID vaccine on 18Dec2020 and the same night patient started with a low grade fever, body aches, chills, muscle pain, shortness of breath, cough, O2 saturation of 80% (hypoxia) and was in the intensive care unit now. Patient swore this was related to the vaccine. This patient tested positive for COVID. He had a CT (computerised tomogram) scan which showed extensive infiltration in the lungs in Dec2020. Patient was admitted to the hospital on 24Dec2020 and then was moved to the ICU 2 days later, on 26Dec2020. Caller thought patient had a positive COVID test at another hospital. Caller did know that tested positive at the current hospital on 26Dec2020 which was done to confirm the previous positive test.

                                                Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis; Slurring his speech; Stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 35-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in deltoid (unknown if right or left) on 17Dec2020 at 30 ug, single for &#39;Preventative&#39;. Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications.(Physician) He is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. States what is going on with the patient may be associated as a side effect. The patient got the vaccine two to three weeks ago, he clarifies the patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and the patient ended up acutely developing (states it is a presumptive diagnosis) Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, states it looks like a radiologic diagnosis. The patient is an employee at hospital. When querying seriousness states it is medically significant but could be disabling but he thinks the patient will recover. Reporter seriousness for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis: Medically significant, Hospitalization. Patient was hospitalized on Sunday and he is still admitted at this time. Dates when patient was in hospital for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from 03Jan2021 to ongoing. Caller thinks the patient was flown to (Place) yesterday. The patient&#39;s mother asked the caller if the caller thought the acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from the vaccine and the caller responded that he did not think it was from the vaccine. He confirms the patient is still admitted in the hospital and the patient&#39;s attending neurologist is doctor. The caller heard about the patient from doctor. When querying covid vaccine dose, the caller states the standard dose is 30 mcg. This was clarified and documented as provided. The patient has not received his second dose yet. He asks if the patient should receive the second dose. He asks a general question if a pregnant patient can be given the Pfizer covid vaccine. He heard the patient had a stroke then the CFO tried to talk to him and the patient was slurring his speech. Caller spoke to the patient&#39;s mother this morning and caller told the mother that he would try to find out what is going on with the patient.  He asked that the patient get an HIV test even though he does not think the patient is at risk. Vaccination facility type was Hospital. Vaccine administered at military facility was No. None additional vaccines administered on same date of the PFIZER suspect. AE acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis require a visit to Emergency Room, not visit to physician office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. He has heard of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis being associated with vaccines in the past and states that it is rare and usually in kids. States he saw patients that may have had acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis back in the 80s and 90s. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (Patient will get steroids tonight pending the review of the x-ray). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke with speech slurred, and the presumptive diagnosis of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (looks like a radiologic diagnosis by the reporting physician), was most likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

                                                First dose of vaccine received on 12/18/20: no adverse reaction, felt great Second dose of vaccine received Thursday night, 1/7/21: no adverse reaction that night but woke up with sore L arm in the morning. So, no unusual side effect for 24h, then experienced on Friday night: headaches, chills, body ache, fatigue. Took 650 mg of acetaminophen. Same symptoms on Saturday with increase in intensity, plus mild fever in the evening at 99.6 F (instead of 97.4 F which is &#34;my normal&#34;), nausea, painful eye balls, sensitivity to light and noise, loss of appetite. Took 650 mg tabs of  acetaminophen throughout the day per bottle instruction.  Extreme fatigue Saturday night and severe headaches, fever at 100.2 F that night, treated with acetaminophen. By Sunday night temperature was 100.9 F, extreme fatigue and severe headaches and painful eye balls, heart rate racing up to 120 BPM when moving from bathroom to living room. Went back down to 65 BPM after about 1min at rest. Tried massages of upper body to loosen muscle, seemed to help with bodyache. Spent Saturday through Tuesday at home. Rapid covid 19 test negative. Back to work on Wednesday.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

A 35-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration (Unknown if  given intramuscularly) on 15Jan2021 09:30 at a single dose on left arm below shoulder for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced fever of 102 for 4 days on 16Jan2021 14:00 and oxygen saturation low on 20Jan2021 12:00 (reported as &#34;12:00 - 12:30&#34;). He received first dose 15Jan2021. He has not had a cough, but had 102 degree Fahrenheit fever for 4 days, so he had to stay home from work. He  had to get a COVID test and it was negative today (unspecified date).

                                                I had the normal symptoms of pain at injection site, headache, fatigue, chills, muscle aches.  I did get a fever for a short duration.  The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

A 35-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via intramuscular on the left arm, on 21Jan2021 at 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. No history of allergic reactions to any meds (medication) in the past or other vaccines in childhood. Otherwise young healthy male with no history of hypertension. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EJ1686) via intramuscular on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 16:00 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe elevation of blood pressure. On 22Jan2021, at 12:00 AM, after the 2nd dose in left arm, after about 24 to 48 hours, the patient experienced vesicular pruritic erythematous patches in multiple locations of my left arm, left arm pit, left upper back, left chest occurred, peaking on day three and still remain after one week. The blisters have opened leaving behind painful ulcers. This is not a rash that disappears in a few days. It will take much longer than that to heal. No rash with the first dose. Also, with both doses, had severe elevation of blood pressure as high as 180/100 within 2 to 5 hours on 22Jan2021, requiring about 3 doses of clonidine over 7 days where bp would cycle up and down. The seriousness of the events was reported as non-serious. Since the vaccination, the patient has been not tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events and included Benadryl, mometasone cream and clonidine. The outcome of the events was reported as recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Had horribly body aches, was extremely flushed, tachycardic and short of breath. The respiratory distress kept increasing which is why I ended up going to the ER.

                                                I tested positive for covid on ~11/26. Relatively mild case with mild fatigue and lost of taste and smell. Possibly some worsening exercise tolerance ~3-4 weeks after initial onset date. I&#39;m not sure if it was deconditioning vs lingering covid effects.   No side effects from first covid vaccine minus a sore arm. After second dose some mild fatigue ~2 days. Then 12 days after second dose significant more fatigue and in the next few days chills at night and tachycardia with pulse in 120s at rest. No fever, pain, sob, swelling or other symptoms. Presented to immediate care on 2/27 predominantly for the tachycardia. Was referred to the ED.  Discharged on 3/1 on metoprolol with possible diagnosis of viral myocarditis.

This 35- year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration, on 12Apr2021 at 09:30 am (at the age of 35-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination, in left arm. The facility where COVID-19 vaccine was administered was a hospital. No known allergies. Patient has no relevant medical history. States: I live a healthy lifestyle diet, exercise, proper rest. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 12Apr2021 10:00 am, the patient stated: I passed out and or blacked out on my drive home from the hospital. I was careful to follow the 15minute wait period before I left the hospital and was ok at that point. I had tense nerve feelings came over me as it grew so strong, I was forced to try and get my car on an off ramp to leave the highway I was on. I thankfully did not get any real injuries to my body as I spun and landed on the side of the road in the grass area. However, this experience was horrifying to say the least. I had a delayed reaction to this vaccine, other than this one incident, I really only had the typical body aches or pain for 24 hours and a bit of nerve twitching. I will not mark this as a risk of death, because it was my driving a car that risked my safety not the vaccine, however, the vaccine did cause the black out. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination.  Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

Common side effects such as chills, headache and severe drowsiness lasted 2 maybe 3 days but the anxious feeling in my chest is still there. Heart palpitations is what I am having and it?s constant. There have been times at work that I can feel my heart beat in my pant legs, temples, wrists and forehead from ordinary stress that I?ve have no issues handling in the past 4 years. Every 30-60 seconds I have to take a deep breath to catch my breath regardless of what I am doing. Suddenly severe drowsiness. I?m sure there?s more that I?m forgetting.

Upon checking vitals was tachycardic with heart rate in 120s; drop in blood pressure to 100/50 (my baseline is 120/75).  No wheezing. No stridor. Oxygen saturations 99%. No hives or rash. No facial or peripheral swelling.  Provided fluids (by mouth), cold compresses, and benadryl. Gradual improvement after this.  Majority of symptoms lasted for approx 1 to 1.5 hours; with some waxing/waning palpitations for another~1 hour.  I have no prior history of similar symptoms after receiving vaccines or medications in the past.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Dec2020 at 15:00 (at the age of 36-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported; however, there were no other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of the vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. On 23Dec2020 at 15:00, the patient experienced a hot feeling in the back of the throat behind the nose and down the throat and then heaviness on the chest and it was harder to breathe. The patient was treated for the hot feeling in the back of the throat behind the nose and down the throat and then heaviness on the chest and it was harder to breathe with 50 mg of oral diphenhydramine (BENADRYL). Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The clinical outcomes of the hot feeling in the back of the throat behind the nose and down the throat and then heaviness on the chest and it was harder to breathe were resolved on Dec2020.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I stopped and walked- it dropped to 168 so I slowed down and it spiked again.  With any exercise since vaccine my heart rate has been elevated.  I have had heart palpitations- two days after the vaccine and blood pressure was high for me.  Blood pressure is not back down but still slightly higher than usual- I have slowed my normal exercise routines down but I am experiencing tightness in chest.

Led to development of pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology, atrial flutter, and subsegmental pulmonary embolism. Workup of other causes of pericardial effusion (e.g., infection, malignancy, autoimmune), and hypercoagulability were otherwise negative. 2nd dose of vaccine was on 1/4/2021 and pericardial effusion was diagnosed and evacuated on 2/14/2021. Patient hospitalized from 2/14/2021-2/17/2021. Patient is also healthcare provider.

Woke up morning of 2/19 and observed extensive petechiae and bloody nose consistent with low platelet count and ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura). I was previously diagnosed with ITP and platelet count was 262k confirmed by blood work a couple days before 2nd vaccine. Morning after got blood draw confirming platelets dropped to below 1k. Medical emergency and sent to ER. Admitted and received emergency treatment to increase platelet counts. Ended up requiring splenectomy on 2/22/21. Just discharged from hospital. Multiple medical providers advised me to submit report to VAERS.

Then as he was walking to schedule his second appointment soon after the vaccine, he fell to his knees (no CHI).  I was notified and ran over to see pt was disoriented, pale, diaphoretic.  While measuring his left arm BP (80/30), he began to convulse with both elbows flexed.  The convulsions lasted about 10 secs, pt did not recall the event, we held him in a seated position on the floor.  He felt much better after the convulsion &#43; water/snacks, however we did call EMS during the event.  Per EMS, BP was 128/80, and pt was AAOx3.  Pt refused to go to the hospital and agreed to f/up with PCP.

This was followed by a spread of the flush/warm feeling across the face, chest and arms followed immediately by a 2-3 minute panic feeling, chest tightness and extremely heightened anxiety with a general feeling of being unable to focus/concentrate. After this couple of minutes the flushing stopped in all areas except the cheeks and the itching sensation dissipated quickly over the next 30 minutes but the feeling of swelling on the roof of the mouth continued for a total of one hour. There were no visible signs of swelling in the mouth, tongue or throat, nor redness in the face. The flushing feeling settled in both cheeks of the face and was accompanied by heightened anxiety, along with an overall feeling of being warm. However, there were no visible signs of redness or rash, the sensations and anxiety persisted for mildly for 10 hours, all of which gradually dissipating over time. That night physical symptoms had cleared up, soreness in the right arm began and lasted into the morning. Anxiety levels mostly returned to normal in the morning.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

A 36-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry dates were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm right, on 02Feb2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated that he is a paramedic. He said everyone has been getting sick around him, and he had a coworker who recently tested positive with the COVID-19 Virus. He said when his coworker tested positive for the COVID-19 Virus, he figured he better get tested for the COVID-19 Virus, before he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He said his COVID-19 Virus test was negative on 02Feb2021, so he got his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He said he had symptoms after her received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He said at the time, he thought his symptoms were from the COVID-19 Vaccine, but now he believes he was probably exposed to the COVID-19 Virus and his symptoms were from a COVID-19 Virus exposure. He said he is schedule to get his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot on 22Feb2021. He asked now that he has tested positive for the COVID-19 Virus on 08Feb2021, does being positive for COVID-19 change if, and when, he should get his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported that he lost his sense of smell, and he knows that losing his sense of smell is not from receiving his first COVID- 19 Vaccine dose. Reported the first day he received his COVID-19 Vaccine shot (02Feb2021) he was fine, saying his arm didn&#39;t even hurt. He said the second day (03Feb2021) he was really tired. He said he had really minor symptoms, like he had a minor cold. He said he was a little achy, and had chills. He said his symptoms were nothing severe, and the symptoms lasted for the first 2 days (03Feb2021 and 04Feb2021) after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he felt better on day 3 (05Feb2021), but still was a little under-the-weather. He said on day 4 (06Feb2021) he couldn&#39;t smell anything at all, and his sense of taste started to go.

A 36-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: Em9810, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 08Feb2021 at 09:30 (age at vaccination was 36 years) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The facility where most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was other. Medical history included type 1 diabetes, asthma and allergy to sulfas. Concomitant medications included aspart (FIASP INSULIN), minerals nos, vitamins nos (CENTRUM), vitamin d nos and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC); the patient received all these within 2 weeks of vaccination, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) administered in right arm on 18Jan2021 at 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EI3302) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient was type 1 diabetic. On 08Feb2021 at 20:00 patients blood sugar was slightly elevated (170mg/dl) 12-24h post injection and severely elevated (200-270mg/dl) 24-32h after injection. More significantly his body was insulin resistant during that time. At time of writing, it was 35h past injection and blood sugar has normalized and insulin again started behaving normally. The event was reported as non-serious with no seriousness criteria (Results in death / Life threatening/ Caused/prolonged hospitalization/ Disabling/Incapacitating/ Congenital anomaly/birth defect). The outcome of the events was recovered/resolved in 2021.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident). A 36 year old brother in law of my friend. He had symptoms of an illness (perhaps covid like symptoms) starting on 19Mar2021 (between his 1st &amp; 2nd dose of Pfizer BioNTech). He went ahead and got his 2nd dose on 21March2021. He then went to see his dr in the last week (week of 05Apr2021 I believe) because of not being well. That primary care dr thought the patient had perhaps been exposed to covid between the 1st &amp; 2nd doses (due to symptoms that the dr thought seemed like body&#39;s over-reaction to covid) but a covid test was done and it was negative. Then the patient has been admitted to (Hospital name) in (city name) (state name) suffering from a stroke on 08Apr2021. He still has not tested positive for covid (again) but he is in ICU at (Hospital name) with stroke symptoms. This was all related to my by the sister-in-law (my friend (name)). I wanted to report since the 2nd dose Pfizer BioNTech was taken on 21Mar2021 &amp; then in hospital ICU with a stroke (at 36 yrs old) on 08Apr2021. Hospitalized for 4 days in ICU currently/still as of 11Apr2021, not yet recovered, admitted with stroke on 08Apr2021. The outcome of the event for illness was unknown and for stroke was not recovered.  Information about Lot/batch number is requested.

                                                4 days after the first shot I was feeling very very dizzy.   My ears felt full enough that I thought maybe they were just full of wax.  I bought an over the counter ear cleaning kit.  That didn&#39;t relieve any symptoms.  I never get headaches, but a couple days later the front top of my head was throbbing.  The area just above my forehead.  It was not sinus pressure, my face didn&#39;t feel any pressure or pain.  My throat also felt like I was being slightly choked.  Not my airway, but just my jugulars.  It began in the evenings.  It would feel like I had been hanging upside down for a while.  My head felt full of blood, like it was going to pop, like my eyes were bugging out.  By a week to 10 days later, my upper arms felt weak, my toes were tingling, and my heart would flutter for just a few seconds occasionally.  I was still dizzy, still felt like I was choking, except I was feeling this way all the time now.  The symptoms only seemed to be staying the same or getting worse.  I have NEVER gone to the doctor on my own in my life to get something checked, but this had me disconcerted enough to check in and see if I should get my second shot at all.  My appointment was to see my doctor was the morning of the same day I was scheduled to get my second Pfizer shot.  My doctor had not heard of these symptoms being associated with the Pfizer shot and chalked my symptoms up to stress.  I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of &#34;waiting to see what happens&#34; if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.  But I accepted the explanation and took the second shot that day anyway.  It should be noted that the second shot made my left armpit swell up quite a bit.  I did feel dizzy again, but not nearly as much.  The other symptoms seemed to not be as bad either.

Right away I had the following symptoms briefly: chills and blurred vision. Around 4:20 or so I left in my vehicle. Shortly after, I had a few chills. I needed to use the restroom and pulled into a gas station. After starting to go the bathroom, I quickly began to feel warm and my vision began to blur. The next thing I knew, I opened my eyes laying on the bathroom floor. I then left the restroom and headed to my vehicle where I noticed I had perspiration on my forehead and was really warm.  Over the next hour or so I experienced chills frequently. They have since subsided.

                                                It has now been more than 1 week since vaccination.  First couple of days were fine, but starting  26-FEB-2021, I&#39;ve been exhibiting all of the following: Fever - Friday 98, Saturday (3 measures over 5 hours) 99.1, 99.3, 99.4, Sunday 98.5, Monday 99.4 (at night, work up in body aches), Tuesday(97.5), Wednesday 98.5 Chills - mild, 1-3 times. comes and goes through past week.  Occurs more at night.  Feeling cold - wearing sweat pants, two shirts, long sleeve shirt, sweater, during sleep.  Constantly add/remove clothes to regulate temperature. During day, have sweat pants &#43; sweater on 78&#43; degree weather. Muscle pain - in back, moving daily. First started in right chest and back right shoulder, has now disappeared.  Now in middle of back, around spin area, hard and uncomfortable to sleep, taking IB profin helps alleviate pain, 2 to 3 tables over counter.  pain in throat around vocal box, could be due to sneezing, slight soreness to touch/aches. Feeling unwell - comes and goes, day starts fine, then around noon/1pm i get super tired and sleep.  Sleeping schedule is generally 10PM to 6AM &#43; naps through day Lose stools - from 25-FEB to 27-FEB, cleared up on 29-FEB Coughing - started on 03-MAR-2021, slight about 1 to 3 times an hour. Headache - comes and goes, use IB profin only when trying to sleep, all other times i let it be.  Good news: No swelling at injection site No redness at injection site  No Swelling at injection site  Final notes: Just feeling up an down, not taking anything besides IB profin for pain management. I was going to work everyday pre-shot with out issue. Post-shot, not feeling well enough to report to work out of fear of spreading anything that i got. Weekend immune system. Slightly grumpy demeanure since sick and interrupted sleep patterns.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

                                                I started feeling sick around 8:00 that evening - more than just sore. I ended up with fever of 102 by 11:00 or midnight; chills and burning up and what prompted me to call my doctor, in the middle of the night, I have a watch with heart rate monitoring and it had woken me up with signal of abnormal heartrate. It was over 130 (normal rate is between 55 and 60 during sleep ) and I had a telemed visit and Dr. said to take Ibuprofen after 24 hour mark. The only other side affect, my bladder side was feeling small and I had to pee every hour. Ibuprofen helped break the fever. The symptoms were resolved by about the following night. My stress level measured by my watch was back in the normal range after I woke up the second morning.

I have never had an allergic reaction, so didn?t pay much attention to it. After returning home I became severely lightheaded and almost passed out. I immediately took a Benadryl and Motrin. Then my heart rate shot up to 160BPM according to my smart watch and maintained that for around 5 minutes. The home medicine helped it to subside, but the same feelings would return in moderate waves. By 2pm, I decided I should seek professional help and was taken to the ER by a family member. By this time I had moderate chest and jaw was very tight. At the ER I was monitored for 1 hour and then given an IV injection of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron(steroid). I immediately get relived and well. I was released from the ER around an hour later and sent home with a prescription of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone Oral Steroid. I have since had a few different side effects like chest pain, extremely flushed face, and low grade fevers. The medicine taken at home immediately stopped the face flushing.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EL9267) on 26Feb2021 and the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EN6202) on 12Mar2021, via an unspecified route of administration on Left Arm at single  dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The administration of first dose of BNT162B2 resulted in Palpitations, dizziness, hyperhidrosis and Syncope the same day of administration. Relevant medical history included allergy to penicillin.  Relevant concomitant medications included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE). During second dose of vaccine the patient stated that he feels the medicine in his body, almost to his toes. The patient was fine for a minute or two but then he reported a big rush of the room spinning, struggling to catch my breath, racing heart. EMS personnel was called over and they monitored my heart rate. It was swinging from 120&#43; BPM to 50 BPM in an instant and during the low BPM was when he passed out.   The patient was treated with Epinephrine due a potential reaction and transported to hospital.  The reported events were feeling abnormal, vertigo, dyspnoea, palpitations, heart rate irregular and loss of consciousness. All events were serious as hospitalization and Life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).

At approx. 11:10am (40 minutes after injection) I started to feel tightness in my chest and developed moderate wheezing. I immediately took two puffs of my albuterol sulfate HFA inhaler. The wheezing stopped after I used the inhaler. I did not need to use my epi injector but it was definitely anaphylaxis based on prior experience. I did not report this to the vaccination site as I had already left. It is now 12:45pm and I feel fine.

                                                I received my second shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, March 20th at noon.  Saturday at midnight, I woke up in full body sweats and aches.  I took two ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep, but I would toss and turn in full body sweats and aches for the next 8 hours.  I took another 2 ibuprofen around 400am.  Sunday morning I woke up feeling OK, not great, but OK.  Sunday night ? it was very strange ? the full body chills and aches came back.  Not as bad as Saturday night, but they returned nevertheless.  I had another restless night of sleep, and I took another two rounds of ibuprofen to try and help me sleep.  Monday I woke up feeling OK again.  Monday evening, around 8:00pm, I could feel the full body chills and aches coming back again, creeping up slightly.  This time, I also felt a mild burning in my upper chest and throat.  I went to bed around 8:00pm, then woke up at 9:00pm, this time in a lot of pain.  It felt like burning and a stabbing sensation in my throat and upper chest.  I took some ibuprofen, and tried to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned in agony for the next few hours, apparently falling asleep at some point around 1:00am.  At 2:00am I woke up in severe pain again.  It was very bad, like an 8 out of a 10.  It felt like a burning and stabbing sensation in my lower throat and upper chest.  I had my wife call 911, and I was brought to hospital in an ambulance.  I would stay in the hospital for the next 3 days, getting discharged Thursday at around 5:00pm.  I had peak troponin levels of 5, so I basically had a moderate heart attack.  I had a cardiac catherization procedure done, as well as a cardiac MRI.  The cardiac catherization procedure showed I had no blockages at all in my arteries.  The cardiologists diagnosed me with myocarditis.  The cardiologists told me they believe the vaccine triggered a heavy response from my auto immune system.  The response from my auto immune system in turn caused my heart to become inflamed, giving me myocarditis.  It was a horrible experience, and my doctors are convinced that it was brought on by the second coronavirus vaccine shot that I received.

ER staff were unable to determine the cause of the pain. Exactly one week after the shot (Tuesday), I start sweating profusely and nearly passing out at work. A day later (Wednesday), my heart rate went through the roof and I was dizzy, out of breath. By Friday night I was in an urgent care clinic with a resting heart rate of 145BPM.

The patient had history of depression and allergies with prednisone and penicillin. Concomitant medications included sertraline (SERTRALINE) taken for an unspecified indication and therapy dates and serum allergy shots. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. On 13Apr2021 21:00,  the patient had flu like symptoms. He also started to feel lots of anxiety and frustration. He felt aggressive and had difficulties thinking clearly. He became confrontational with his partner and ended up jumping out of the moving vehicle, at a slow speed. He did have a long day, but he felt like irritability was a big factor. He also had issues breathing with his lungs and felt like his heartbeat was a little bit off. He did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination and not tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events and recovered in 2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 37-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 19Feb2021 13:00 [also reported as 26Feb2021 12:45 PM] (Lot Number: EL9267; Expiration Date: May2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included drug penicillin allergies and low testosterone ongoing since 2018. Concomitant medication included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE) for low testosterone, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin but had allergies. The patient reported that a few minutes after his first vaccination (19Feb2021), he experienced a racing heart, dizziness, sweating, and almost felt like fainting. A couple waves of this hit him and subsided after 10-15 minutes. The events required emergency room visit. The patient has not been covid tested post vaccination.

A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

                                                I am a registered  nurse at  hospital.  On 12/25,   seven days after  receiving the  shot  I started to get right lower leg pain and I kept complaining about it till New Years Day. I had no symptoms of a DVT.  I triaged on 1/1/21 and the doctors  ordered  labs/imaging  and the results were  as followed: D-Dimer  biomarker  (&#43;) , Ultrasound of the Rt lower leg ( - ) ,  CTA showed a PE (segmental right upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus). I  was discharged on  Xarelto and advised to follow  up with a hematologist. On 1/5/2021,  I went to hematology and they did a whole bunch of labs. I was sent to get a  ultrasound   of the leg because the pain persist and they found  a clot hidden by my soleus. The plan is to continue on the Xarelto for 6 months. Come back in 3 weeks to scan my leg again and get my lab results.  On 1/12/2021, I received the 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccination.

Recovered consciousness within a few seconds, had to lay on the floor for about 5 minutes due to nausea, then got back in bed and went back to sleep.  Woke up 3 hours later and felt completely fine except a little fatigue - all other symptoms had resolved.

A 38-years-old male patient started to receive 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142, Expiry Date: 01Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 30Dec2020 18:17 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was reported as &#39;None&#39; and AEs following prior vaccinations was reported as &#39;None&#39;. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was reported as None. The patient experienced really bad chills, body aches, fever, unable to sleep on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, passed out on bathroom floor for 5-10 seconds, sweating and neck was stiff on 01Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, headache on an unspecified data with outcome of unknown.  Details were as follows: the patient received the Covi-19 vaccine 30Dec2021. He had a reaction to the vaccine. 24 hours after getting the vaccine he had really bad chills, body aches, fever 100.4. He didn&#39;t take any medication for a bit. He then took acetaminophen (TYLENOL). He had a headache, he was unable to sleep. The acetaminophen worked and he went to bed. At 5:00 am he started having a bad headache and took Ibuprofen. He woke up to go to the bathroom. He passed out for 5-10 seconds in the bathroom. His head was leaning in the wall by the door. He was sweating and was stiff all over. He went to the Emergency Room on 01Jan2021. They did an X-ray and a CT scan. They gave him 100ml of saline and some pills. They also did some lab work. Everything was negative. They assumed his body couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. He was supposed to have received the second shot yesterday (20Jan2021). Employee Health said his Primary Care Physician would have to make the decision on him taking it or not. His doctor said he would have to do more research with Pfizer before he says if he can take it or not. Emergency Room visit required due to event passing out.

The worst occurred the day after when my body could no longer absorb insulin. I increased my basal rate by almost 400% and could not bring my sugars down. Saturday afternoon I began experiencing symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis: stomach pain, vomiting, high ketones and very high  blood sugars. I was able to eventually take in enough water to lower my ketones and sugar and narrowly avoided going to the ER, but high blood sugars and headache have persisted and I am still experiencing these symptoms.

He inquired about having his blood pressure taken.  His blood pressure at this time was 193/111.  I gave him some water and discussed next steps.  He agreed to remain in the Observation room to see if the water helped, and if trying to relax would help his symtoms.  Patient has a history of high blood pressure.  After an additional 30 minutes of observation, his blood pressure was taken again and this time it was 199/127.  At this time, he agreed to be seen in the ER for an assessment by the ER physcian.  At this time, his care was turned over to the ER staff.

                                                I passed out while sitting in the observation area shortly after receiving my shot (10-15 minutes). I was initially able to walk from the area where the injection was administered about 50 yards to the observation area. Sat down &amp; shortly thereafter could feel myself getting woozy. I laid my head back &amp; closed my eyes hoping to avoid it. I was given two epinephrine shots the second of which woke me up. Several medical staff were around me when I opened my eyes. I was taken to the patient wing and checked into my own room for observation for a few more hours. Blood was drawn and sent off for a Triptase test which came back negative a couple days later. After being kept under observation for a few hours I was release around noon. I have a history of problems with shots/needles. Haven&#39;t actually passed out from it in over 20 years, but it is a known problem.

We immediately got a yoga mat, asked the patient to remove his shirt.  He fell to the ground.  We placed a cold pack under his head around the neck area and cold paper towels on his head.  We took his blood pressure it was 136/88.  He started to mention his chest hurting.  His past medical history includes fainting in the past (due to low blood sugars) and open heart surgery as a child.  He is currently under the care of a cardiologist.  More recently he has had several fainting spells which he believes is due to low blood sugar.  He stated he had eaten a good lunch around 11:30.  It was about 2:30 when this incident occurred.  We offered the patient, a banana, orange, chicken sandwich and water.  He ate the orange.  We called EMS.  When they arrived, they checked his blood sugar which it was 95.  He started to feel better and his wife drove him to the cardiologist.

Later that night after going to bed he woke up w/ his muscles and nerves twitching and tingling.  He says you can sometimes see the muscles spasms and then other times he feels it tingling under the skin. Pt is still having these symptoms. He had a sore arm for about 48 hours. For about 3 to 4 days he had a faster heart rate and higher blood pressure than normal.   He developed a headache that lasted about 2 days.  Currently he is having some brain fog  and his shoulder and biceps still have a heavy feeling like they are detached from his body along with the muscle twitching and tingling.  He does not feel like these symptoms are improving and will see his PCP on 3/29/2021.

No reaction all day.  No reaction all day Saturday.  Saturday/Sunday night I started vomiting into my CPAP mask/machine while still asleep. I wouldn?t have woken up unless my wife was there to hear me choking. She cleaned out my mask and had me lay on my side all night while monitoring me.  Scary stuff. Just thought you should make your friends with apnea aware. I still don?t remember the incident at all. I have a mild fever right now, 99.8. I used to tell my wife she saved my life, but now I don&#39;t mean it figuratively. UPDATE: I forgot to mention that I passed out Saturday night.  I was standing in the kitchen and the next thing I knew I was on the ground.

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.

                                                myocarditis; severe chest pain; developed severe flu symptoms; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 39-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 08:30 AM (at the age of 39 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a hospital. The patient had no medical history and had no known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included testosterone. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 12Jan2021 at 12:30 AM (at the age of 39 years old) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient developed severe flu symptoms on 02Feb2021 at 20:30. The patient experienced chest pain and myocarditis on 12Feb2021 at 03:00 AM. It was reported that after 12 hours, the patient developed severe flu symptoms for the following 48 hours. Then she developed severe chest pain and was hospitalized for myocarditis. The patient was hospitalized in Feb2021 for 5 days. The patient received treatment for the events which included heart medications and heart angiogram. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination which included blood test and nasal swab, both with negative results on 12Feb2021. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event myocarditis was most likely due to influenza, which was an intercurrent infection, and unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162B2. There is no plausible mechanism implicating BNT162B2 to the reported event based on the drug known safety profile. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 12:15 (lot number: EN6208) as single dose at the age of 39 years old for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies: minor reaction to iodine CT contrast. Concomitant medications included fish oil, turmeric [curcuma longa rhizome] (TURMERIC), and xantofyl (LUTEIN); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced allergies (minor reaction to iodine CT contrast). On 11Mar2021 12:45 PM, within an hour of the shot, the patient started feeling dizzy. Intense fatigue and full body aches set in within 3 hours. Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours. Low fever, chills, heavy heartbeat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours. Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours. Facial numbness, heavy heartbeat, and fatigue persist, though drooping has become less pronounced and the other symptoms have largely resolved at 100 hours since the first shot. Seeking guidance on whether further medical help should be sought (did nurse line call with insurance company) and whether the booster shot should be administered. The AEs resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was given for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. No other vaccines received four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae.
