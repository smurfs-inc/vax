Before bed time, had cold sweats and shakes. 1/29 - woke up feeling perfectly fine.  2/17 - Second dose of vaccine. Arm felt sore and was sore two days after. From 2/18-2/20, I noticed the effects of the Cymbalta were gradually decreasing and was experiencing side effects (shocks from toe to head every step). Turns out that even with taking my regular dose of the Cymbalta, my body after 2 hours feels like I had never taken it.   2/20 - After experiencing heavy shocks, shaking, and heart racing, I went home after coming into work 3 hours later.  2/21 - Woke up today feeling dizzy, fatigued, and weak.

                                                Patient was sitting down for a few minutes after their vaccine and then got up to tell the pharmacy staff he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He walked back to the waiting room and fell onto the bench. I went out to sit with him and held onto him as he passed out/lost consciousness for approximately 20 seconds. We gave him water and called 911. The paramedics arrived and checked his vitals. He was fine after that and stayed for about a half an hour before he left.

                                                The patient received vaccine at 1245. At 1246 patient started having an adverse event. The RN noticed that the patient started to get white and pale. The RN asked him if he was okay. He stated yes and then he started to faint. The staff gently got him on the floor. They checked his vital signs. His vital signs were within normal limits. They monitored patient for 15 minutes while he was lying on the floor and another 15 minutes in a seated position. They took him to their observation area where they monitored him for another 30 minutes. The patient&#39;s mother came in and stated that this happens every time the patient gives blood or receives an injection.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving vaccination, patient started experiencing cold sweats and he felt like we was about to pass out. I took him into the clinic room and allowed him to lay down and began to fan him down for him to cool off. After 1-2 minutes, we put him on his back and elevated his feet. While he was laying down, I checked his blood pressure and it was low. I let him lay down for 5 more minutes and he started to feel much better and was cooled down. I slowly got him up and allowed him to sit and checked his blood pressure again. The blood pressure began to normalize. After 5 more minutes, I told him to get up and slowly walk to another chair in the room. Once he was rested there for about 5 minutes, I checked his blood pressure a 3rd time in the opposite arm and it was normal. He no longer felt the light headed feeling and was cooled off. The patient&#39;s partner then informed me that he has a fear of needles and the last time he received a vaccination about 7 years ago, the same reaction happened.

He said he felt really dizzy and we had him lay down. He was very sweaty and was shaking a little bit. I took his blood pressure at 11:53 and it was approximately 124/93. He was responsive but feeling dizzy and warm and I stayed with him until the paramedics arrived at about 11:54

Once laying on floor I elevated patient&#39;s feet above his head. By stander reported that patient appeared to have blacked out right before I arrived on scene. Patient stayed upright in chair during blackout which only lasted a few seconds.  Patient stated he did eat breakfast but had not slept due to working overnight. Patient was assisted to sitting position on floor at 11:33a at which time he drank a bottle of water. After finishing bottle of water he stated he felt dizzy again and I assisted him back to a laying position on floor.  After 10 minutes I assisted patient back to a sitting position. After sitting for a few seconds patient stated he felt like he would get sick. Before I could return, patient vomitted on himself and over the floor. Patient continued to vomit/dry heave into trashcan for a few minutes. After patient was done getting sick, he drank another bottle of water. He sat for a few minutes prior to standing. At this time patient&#39;s mother-in-law had arrived at store to take patient home. Patient wanted to leave store immediately as he felt it was making him more uncomfortable due to current condition. Patient left store approximately 12p.

Post-administration, patient was instructed to sit for observation. Technician stated that approximately 2 min or so after patient sat down, he came up to her at the window to state that he was feeling lightheaded and weak. Consequently, while in conversation with her, patient gently collapsed onto the floor. He was alert and conscious the entire time; temp was 97; patient was noted to be pale and sweating profusely. Patient was provided water, ice pack and orange juice. Ambulance was offered and he was taken by paramedic for further evaluation.

                                                First noticed symptoms after waking up during the night roughly 14 hours after receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Felt EXTREMELY fatigued and my heart was racing. Fell back asleep and woke up again around 8am. Symptoms persisted. Extremely tired and fatigued and heart was beating fast. Resting heart rate of around 100bpm which jumped to 120bpm when I moved at all (including just rolling over in bed). This persisted throughout the day, and I stayed in bed. In the early afternoon (about 24 hours after 2nd vaccine dose) I started to feel aches in neck and back and started a headache. Took my temperature and had a fever (101). Aches/headache continued to get worse throughout the afternoon. Finally around 4:30pm I found my Tylenol and took a dose. This substantially helped reduce all my symptoms; although I was still tired, it was much less than earlier in the day. Took a dose of Advil around 7:30pm and went to bed about an hour later. By morning, my symptoms were practically all gone, I was just slightly more tired than normal that day (2nd day after vaccine). I did not take any more medication.

Afterwards I couldn&#39;t sleep because of a racing heart rate when I returned home after about an hour. Heard rate stabilized and I was able to nap after another hour. I had a serious brain fog, vertigo, dizziness, wandering eyes (can&#39;t focus them, going cross-eyed a lot), memory loss (unsure if I completed a task or not), and faint hearing (this improved on day 2). I&#39;m currently on day 3 and I am trending upward but not 100% yet.

                                                Initial event was hives that didn&#39;t itch appearing on elbows, they continued to spread for about a day. The doctor said to start Zyrtec, pepcid and ibuprofen. Hours later vomiting, diarrhea, and a blackout followed along with a fever of 102. This time ER gave IV fluids, acetaminophen, ketorolac, ondansetron, and sodium chloride .9%. At this time no mention or notice was made of the hives previously looked at. After this Zyrtec, Pepcid and acetaminophen were being taken regularly. Throughout the rest of that day the hives got worse along with pretty severe angioedema. Also, a feeling of swollowing around a lump in my throat. No change through the night into next day (Friday) for the hives,swelling and lump feeling in throat. Went to walk in clinic where I was prescribed prednisone tapered for 16 days. After the first day of steroids not much change. After 2 there was some improvement. As of today one week after receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine approximately 90% of the hives are gone, only mild swelling and some muscle fatigue and pain left.

                                                Pt reports that he waited for about 20 minutes after being vaccinated. During that time he felt a little hot and drank some water, but says he otherwise felt fine. He states that he stopped for gas after leaving the clinic and has no memories after that until he was being pulled from his car by a paramedic. He states that he was told he had a seizure and crashed his car. After the motor vehicle accident he says he was transported to the hospital, where they told him he had had a seizure, did some tests, and then released him. Pt states his heart rate and glucose were both elevated when he was at the hospital, but that his CT scan was normal. He states he was feeling fine we he got gas, and says he feels fine now (5/10/21: three weeks and two days later). He saw his primary care provider last week (5/5/21) and was referred to Neurology. He had an MRI done, which he reports was normal, and an EEG, which he says he is still waiting on results from. Pt reports no history of seizure prior to 4/17/21.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s parent). A 26-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (reported as &#34;this afternoon&#34;) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at 26-year-old) as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as no. Concomitant medications were not reported. Couple minutes into that he got light headed, his vision got blurred and then he had a complete vision loss. They cleared the room and called the paramedics. The paramedics came and said that both of his eyes were dilated and his blood pressure was high. They sat him for couple of minutes, then his vision return. So if they ask them make the total of vision loss lasted for seven minutes. His blood pressure went down. They kept him there and had a given a bottle of water and two container of fruit juice to bring his sugar level up. They made sure everything seems alright. And paramedics left and said that they thought it would be cause from some sort of blood reaction and allergic reaction to vaccine. And told them not to get the second shot. And let us want to he felt ok that it would be alright to go home. They did keep him there for about half an hour longer just to make sure he was alright and then sent him home. That was just a reaction and he should be ok now. No treatment received. The outcome of the events was resolved on an unspecified date. Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                A 26-year-old male with no past medical history presents to the emergency department (ED) with an acute episode of chest pain. He reports initially mild dull substernal chest pain for a day prior to an episode of acute sharp chest pain that radiates to his left neck and left shoulder accompanied by diaphoresis leading him to present to the ED. He had received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine three days prior to presentation and reported myalgia and weakness beginning within 24 hours of vaccination. His blood pressure on arrival was 126/83 mmHg and pulse was 61 bpm. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed diffuse upsloping 2mm STE, no reciprocal changes, and PR elevation in aVR. Troponin-I on admission was 6.03 ng/ml prior to peaking at 21 ng/ml while initial CRP was 56.8 mg/L. Transthoracic echo (TTE) showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55-60% with hypokinesis of the basal lateral wall. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was consistent with myocarditis showing subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the basal inferior wall, no edema on T2 sequences, and a mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with an LVEF of 51%. He was started on colchicine, low dose beta blocker and losartan and improved symptomatically along with resolution of the EKG findings prior to being discharged with plan for close outpatient follow-up and repeat imaging.  In addition, a respiratory viral PCR panel was obtained which was positive for Rhinovirus/Enterovirus on nasal swab. Although it is possible that his presentation was secondary to enteroviral myocarditis, the temporal relationship to the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine suggests the possibility of myocarditis secondary to immunologic response to COVID-19 vaccine itself.

                                                I have had occasional brief chest pains, like a painful tightness around my heart that lasts a couple seconds at a time.  They have been random and infrequent enough I have not done anything about it (also, I am currently uninsured), but v-safe suggested I should submit a VAERS report of it anyway.  Obviously I cannot be entirely sure it is related, but it is not something I have experienced before.

The day after he received the second shot, he fainted while using the restroom and woke on the bathroom floor on 12May2021 at 07:30, he was on the floor for a few minutes, 2 to 3 minutes. After that there was no other fainting. Patient had been having heart palpitations since the second dose on 13May2021. Did not particularly remember the time, just that it was in the middle of the day. The palpitations were going away and were less prevalent. He went to the Emergency room (ER) this past Sunday night because it was really working up and he couldn&#39;t wait to go to the doctor. Physician office was no. Electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood work were done in the emergency room on unspecified date in May2021 and came back normal. He was supposed to meet with a cardiologist next week. On unspecified date in May2021, he still felt kind of like he senses his heart beating but he didn&#39;t usually think about. It felt more strange, than soreness. This was all just so new. Thought it was a sign that he was going to recover and it was going to go away. The palpitations were coming on less and less. Was not so much of an irregular heart beat than last week. On unspecified date in May2021, felt like his heart was getting strong. Felt like his heart was making it&#39;s way back and was more like a sore or a strain. It had been going down and he was not feeling his heart in his chest. Treatment was no, not this far. There was not prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The outcome of the event &#34;fainted while using the restroom and woke on the bathroom floor&#34; was unknown, for other events was recovering.

                                                I began to experience rapid heart rates to the 140s intermittently starting on the Wednesday following my first vaccination.  I also had associated neck pain and &#34;pounding sensation&#34; in my neck, chest, and arms. I had difficulty lying flat at night and developed a dry cough. I went to the urgent care on 4/19/21 and was diagnosed with torticollis. No one at the urgent care listened to my heart or lungs. Given that my symptoms had been diagnosed, I delayed seeking further treatment. My symptoms continued to worsen. I had difficulty walking long distances, exercising. I became short of breath easily. I ended up going to my primary care doctor on 4/26/21 for a second evaluation. He was concerned and did an EKG, it only showed sinus tachycardia. He scheduled me for an echocardiogram and put me on a beta blocker (Bystolic) 5 mg once daily. The echo showed EF 47% with global hypokinesis of the L ventricle. Doctor called me into the office as soon as he saw the results, concerned for myocarditis or pericarditis.

                                                I haven?t gone to a doctor. Before any news came out about heart inflammation, I felt my heart beating really fast after this vaccine. Now it?s been 2 months and I still feel like my heart is ?inflamed?. I?m a big believer in science, and I stand by the vaccine, but literally my heart has been hurting a lot more (IT LITERALLY NEVER HURT) before the vaccine. I really hope I didn?t just mess up my body somehow with this. Legitimately the pain is not bad at all (maybe a 2 out of ten) but it has not gone down since I got the vaccine. I notice when I do physical activity I also get tired faster. I run, I?m a relatively healthy person but I?m experiencing some mild heart inflammation after this shot. Please take note. I still stand beside the vaccine, I?m just explaining what symptoms I?m feeling. And of course idk if it?s from the vaccine, but I?ve never had this feeling in my heart before having this vaccine. I hope it goes away.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly in unknown arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for routine mass immunizations (covid-19 immunization). The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Not a military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none and concomitant medications was none (he was on no other medications). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced tachycardia, intermittent palpitations, low grade fever/fever all started somewhere in the morning of 18Dec2020 and muscle aches on 17Dec2020. Physician assessed tachycardia and intermittent palpitations as serious due to medically significant. Physician stated that one of his workers had the vaccine and proceeded to have tachycardia and low grade fever. He would like to know if patient should get the second dose. The patient had mostly tachycardia with some intermittent palpitations. Patient was seen in his office on 18Dec2020, and got the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020. He also reported fever and muscle aches, although the fever was subjective and was not documented. Tachycardia improved and sent him to cardiology on 21Dec2020. It was not life threatening and they did an Electrocardiogram (EKG). His initial heart rate was 130. When he was seen again in their office on 21Dec2020, it was 93, which was baseline. It improved. He never got his temperature. The highest in office was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He had some muscle aches. The physician just sent patient to cardiology because he was having intermittent tachycardia and intermittent palpitations. Two visits to physician office. He was seen on 18Dec2020 and again on 21Dec2020. Relevant tests: they did testing for tachycardia but not related specifically. They did thyroid and EKG in office and he did not know if test were back. EKG was ok. The Thyroid, Complete blood count (CBC) and lipid (all were on an unknown date in Dec2020) were not back and were just done to make sure there were no cardiac issues. The outcome of the events was recovering. The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events tachycardia and palpitations cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Heart rate increased a bit. Slightly labored breathing. Started feeling overall strange throughout body, general malaise. Didn&#39;t advance beyond this. Took 50mg of benadryl shortly after and symptoms improved over the following hour.

                                                Around 7 pm I started feeling really anxious. I checked my HR on my smart watch and it said that around 12pm my HR was 157bpm which was right after getting the vaccine when I started walking home. My  resting HR is usually 47-52bpm. I am a very active person. I have been waking up in the middle of the night multiple times in night sweats and it feels like my heart is contracting very hard. I notice that my HR jumps up right when I start to be more active, but more than normal. On the 11th my average walking HR was 140. Today at work my HR was 134 at the highest around 9am and the lowest was 56bpm around 7am when I was getting ready for work. Additionally to the increased HR I have SOB when I walk and talk. I did have a sore arm as well the first day, but nothing more than any other injection I have had before.

                                                When patient was in for his 2nd dose, reported that an hour after the first vaccination was given he felt like his heart rate was high. No measurement was ever taken to confirm it was in fact high. He also became flushed. He was wearing a sweatshirt, so when he took that off he was feeling better. This episode lasted for 5 hours. No comorbidities or other heart conditions. We asked if he was possibly dehydrated or had any caffeine that day. I determined to proceed with dose 2 under the request that he came back after 1 hour and 2 hours respectively to get vitals.

                                                4/10/2021 experienced some right side facial paralysis upon waking.  Called urgent care who directed me to go to a hospital as soon as possible and asked about all events leading up to this, noting that the vaccine may potentially have this side effect, as written in the medical journal.  Went to the ER, they put me in stroke protocol, did CAT scan, negative results, blood tests (including for Lyme), MRI to look for tumors after the CAT scan was negative, and an echocardiogram as they detected a new heart murmur never present before. MRI showed Bell&#39;s palsey in one facial nerve, all other tests are negative, including for Lyme&#39;s disease, a common cause.  I am still experiencing it, and am on Valtrex (anti viral) and Prednisone, but the symptoms still exist. There is no other change in my life or health, the only thing I&#39;ve done differently is have the vaccine (for which we are grateful).

                                                I had intense stomach pains, muscle pains for 4 days. Could not get out of bed. Also had a fever. I thought these were regular side effects and eventually got better.   Then, about a week later I started getting nose bleeds with blood clots coming out of my nose.  These lasted a few more days. This never happened to me before, and must have been a side effect from the vaccine.

Patient was tended to by the NP on duty, instructed to lie down and drink water while she tended to his cut. Patient mentioned it &#34;tasted like he threw up&#34; and still felt lightheaded after 15 minutes after the event. Patient was insistent that we should not call the squad as he does not have insurance. Patient in the meantime was trying to get ahold of a friend or family member to pick him up as we advised him that he could not leave in this state. We elected to call the squad as he had not recovered yet. Before the squad could come, the patients brother showed up and quickly whisked him away. Squad did show up but there was nothing to attend to so left without intervention.

Patient hit chin and did lacerate it; this was attended to by NP who was administering shots at the time. Patient mentioned that he &#34;tasted like he threw up,&#34; was instructed to drink water. NP took vitals and patient showed no sign of concussion. In the mean time patient was trying to get ahold of a friend or family member to come pick him up. Still felt lightheaded 15 minutes after being attended to, at this time we called the squad. Before the squad could show up patients brother came to pick him up... was whisked away too quickly for us to stop him. Patient was adamant about us not calling squad because he does not have insurance.

                                                27 year old male with Down&#39;s Syndrome and no other past medical history received second COVID-19 vaccine on 4/27/2021. On 4/30/2021 began &#34;feeling poorly&#34; with nausea/vomiting and possible chest discomfort. Originally presented to ED on morning of 4/30 - EKG completed demonstrated diffused ST elevation. Patient was transferred to Medical Center for heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries and LVEDP of 25. Stat ECHO demonstrated pericardial effusion and concern raised for myopericarditis. Patient subsequently transferred to a different Medical Center for higher level of care. Upon arrival to Medical Center plan was to intubate and take to cath lab for heart biopsy and PA catheter placement. However, upon intubation patient began to decompensate and subsequently developed cardiac arrest. During ACLS, VA ECMO was placed and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. Following VA ECMO placement patient received IVIG, high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg), anakinra 100 mg, and broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn). Despite these efforts the patient continued to have hemodynamic instability and was on high dose vasopressors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, angiotensin II, vasopressin). Patient subsequently suffered another cardiac arrest, briefly regained pulse with high dose vasopressors, but subsequently lost pulse despite best efforts and died on 5/1/2021 at approximately 13:00.

He experienced LOC, which lasted less than 1 minute, and fell on his left side onto the floor. Patient came to immediately and was alert when medical response team arrived. Patient was mildly pale and diaphoretic, which improved as he laid down supine on bed. He endorsed some nervousness but lightheadedness seemed to be getting better. Patient had only had a banana and some water prior to his appointment. He denied chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath at the time of syncope.  Due to the abrasions on his left maxillary area and ear, patient thought to have hit head on the floor. EKGs done by paramedics showed sinus rhythm with ST elevation in leads V3-V6, repeated twice with same finding. Patient then mentioned that he has been having sharp chest pain intermittently over the past few months that would go away on its own. He had not seen a medical professional for those symptoms. IV line started in left antecubital area. Patient was given baby aspirin by paramedics.   Patient?s first COVID vaccination was uneventful. He denied any medical conditions, allergies, or medications. Family history includes diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disease.

A 27-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EV8732/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 07Apr2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 27 years old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included COVID-19 on an unspecified date. The patient did not have any known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication (other medications taken in two weeks) were none.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 19Apr2021 at 22:00, the patient experienced similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down, Heart palpitations, left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck, low grade fever, severe fatigue and slightly dry cough. The events required a physician&#39;s office visit. The patient received treatment for these events. The clinical course of the events was as follows: Heart palpitations originating under left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck. Similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down, low grade fever, severe fatigue, and slightly dry cough. Lasted about 30 hours. Discomfort relief, like pericarditis, was only felt when sitting up and propping myself up by my arms leaning forward. Onset was rapid, occurring 13 days after the first dose of the vaccine over a period of 8 hours (palpitations came first, followed by shoulder and neck pain in the morning). Treated with Aspirin at first (low effectiveness) followed by NSAID Advil 7 hours later (high effectiveness, symptom relief was about 50%). High strength Advil recommended by MD. The outcome of the events was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

A 27-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EW0164), intramuscular in the left arm on 15Apr2021 (at the age of 27-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On 15Apr2021, immediately after the vaccine, the patient experienced syncope due to which he fell. He fell from standing and hit his head on a table. There were no signs of soft tissue injury. The patient was brought into the emergency department from the vaccination room. The patient was not treated for the events. The clinical outcome of syncope, fell from standing and hit head on table was resolved on Apr2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of  BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot  be excluded based on temporal association.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

An ECHO was performed and LVEF was 45%, and an EKG showed possible ST elevation. Per the Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine study there were no reports of STEMI being an adverse effect. Given the patient&#39;s ejection fraction of 45%, there was likely a prior medical condition the patient was unaware of and may have precipitated the STEMI rather than the vaccine . Hospitalized for 2 days and diagnosed with pericarditis.

I grabbed our emergency kit and went to patient&#39;s aid.  He was on the floor with his head against the shelving.  He was not conscious.  I instructed a staff member to call 911. I put my hand on his arm and the other on his chest and asked several times if he was ok.  After approximately 30 seconds he looked at me and regained consciousness.  He knew where he was and recognized his wife in the immediate vicinity.  He said that he has a history of fainting and he thought maybe seeing his wife get vaccinated and seeing a small amount of blood on her arm before I put a band-aid on her arm triggered his fainting spell.  EMS arrived after about 10 minutes and shortly thereafter he fainted again.

                                                After first Pfizer dose, I was just feeling really tired. After the second dose, around that afternoon/evening I started feeling my mouth feeling weird. The next day I saw blisters filled with yellow/whiteish puss in my tongue. I went to the ER later i felt a lump under left shoulder while showering. On 28 MAY 3 AM I suddenly felt my face feeling numb and tingly along with my legs. Mind you I have been in the field emplacing howizters for the past few days in a field exercise. I also jammed my finger on an 80 lb metal bar on 26 MAY and got my finger poked with a hot device that also drained the blood after getting an xray. I called medical ER  at 242 and spoke to Dr.(?) Doctor did not give me his name spelling after I asked for the spelling and he told me that I could always come in to the ER. I told him whether the finger pricking and blooding draining could cause the left facial numbness and legs tingleness. He said no so i am now assuming it is an adverse side effect. I am a smart guy have bachelors in journalism but right now I cannot concentrate and filling out htis form hastily just i case the effects get worse and I have to go to hospital er. Talking to the Dr. (?) was harder than normal and he asked if my breathing was normal, I said i am breathing heavily, which I did not have much control over. He said breathe normally and I will be better from the tingliness. I can write well I am a journalism major but this is hard to write for me . I am also feeling chills and I am also not feeling well. I was able to get this link from my local online meeting and I am glad I can contribute to the research and science in general. I wish the doctor had tested me for possible problems when I had an adverse effect from the first vaccine but the doctor told me to come back if the &#34;viral infection&#34; gets worse after I breathe normal. I did take a PT test and my 2 mile run time increased and it was much harder to run than the 2 mile run. Time went up by at least 3 minutes.

                                                five minutes after vaccine was received patient lost consciousness and fell out of his chair.   It is unclear if the patient hit his head or shoulder against the wall, but patient was talkative and responsive and did not want to call an emt.  The patient did call his mom to have her drive him home as a precation. The patient was given water, asked to lie down.   After about 10 minutes the patient stated he felt normal.

                                                Assumed it was a cold initially, due to sore throat. Sore throat came without other side effects of cold.  Used a flashlight to look at throat. I appear to have developed a canker sore on my tonsil. Because of the location of it, the tonsil is also agitated and has been bleeding leading me to have black stool as well as cough up blood and an upset stomach. This is something I have never experienced before.  It may be unrelated to the vaccine, I am not sure, but I figured it is something worth reporting.

Pt underwent coronary angiogram which showed angiographically normal coronaries. Patient had echocardiogram which showed normal LV and RV systolic function, no pericardial effusion. Patient underwent cardiac MRI which showed LVEF 61%, RVEF 53%, and subepicardial delayed hyperenhancement in the basal and mid infero-lateral walls of LV. This finding was consistent with acute myocarditis. Patient was discharged home with a cardiac event monitor. No medications were prescribed.

On Tuesday 5.18.21 started to develop chest tightness and pressure (like someone was pushing against the center of my chest). Also experienced some shortness of breath. Went to Emergency Room Fri 5.21.21, all tests came back fine. Went to cardiologist in early June 2021 and in early June a cardiac MRI found everything to be normal. Cardiologist has me taking advil and prilosec at the moment. Have experienced these symptoms since 5.18.21 and has not gone away.

                                                No initial reaction to the vaccine, but I started to get what I thought to be a sinus infection about two days after the first vaccine. Congested, but overall healthy (ran 13 miles on 04/04/2021). I woke up in the night about a week after the first vaccine (around 4:00 AM on 04/07/2021) having trouble breathing -- tight throat and chest. I thought it was my sinus infection, received a negative covid test, and started taking augmentin. The tightness continued for about 3 days along with a shortness of breath, no other symptoms though. My resting heart rate was also hovering around 100 bpm until the weekend before the second vaccine.  I had no initial reaction to the second vaccine either. However, about a week later the same thing happened. I woke up around 1:00 AM 04/26/2021 hyperventilating with a tight throat and chest. This continued for about 3 days again, so I took another covid test -- negative again. My resting heart rate was back up to 100 bpm. I started to think it was a strange reaction to the vaccine, so I still had my infusion for Crohn&#39;s Disease on 04/30/2021. Blood pressure was okay, somewhere around 104/67 I think, but my heart rate was 107 bpm. After that weekend, I felt back to normal. Not sure if this was all caused by the vaccines, but it seems possible.

                                                A continuous pain feeling in the center of chest. Chest area also had a somewhat constricted and general tightness feeling. On the 3rd-5th days after the shot, had a few brief periods of dizziness and high anxiety, lasting less than a minute or so each. Symptoms improved pretty quickly from there, and by about day 7 or so the chest pain was gone and felt completely back to normal. No significant fatigue, fever, or problems breathing at any point. Have not had any symptoms at all since.

                                                Around 2 weeks after my first dose, I started having heart palpitations. The palpitations were on and off for a week and I didn&#39;t think of it much. A week after the palpitations started it started happening more frequently and I was feeling light headed and I went to ER. I was diagnosed with SVT and put on metoprolol to control my heart rate. 1 week after I was on metoprolol, I took my second dose. I was feeling a little dizzy after my second dose but it improved after like 10 minutes. I started getting very fatigued and difficult to concentrate after my second dose. I  spoke to my doctor and we thought it was because of metoprolol. My cardiologist took me off metoprolol but the fatigue didn&#39;t stop and I started having aches in shoulders, arms, neck and back. The aches and fatigue was more severe in the morning. After a week of being off metoprolol I started waking up with chest pain. One day the pain was severe and I had aches in shoulders, arms, neck and back and my heart rate was around 140 so I went to ER. The doctors put me on carvedilol and my heart rate has been controlled but my body aches and fatigue has been going on. The cardiologist and my PCP aren&#39;t sure if SVT or the medication is causing my body aches and fatigue. The only other thing I could think of was the vaccine so I wanted to send this report.

Presented to ED and found to have elevated troponin, initially normal ECG. Admitted to hospital, experienced recurrent chest pain, rising troponin to 23750, and STE on ECG, and was taken to cath lab, with normal left heart cath. Then transferred to heart medical center for further eval and cardiac MRI. Felt by cardiology there to have myopericarditis potentially related to Pfizer vaccine. Cardiology also wondering if possible inflammatory bowel disease might increase his risk of myocarditis, though no established diagnosis (outpatient gastroenterology workup planned).

The issue has been worsening over time, and chronic sneezing has been getting worse.  I have no history of allergies, but I wonder if the vaccine could trigger the onset of new allergies?  Also, 2 days after my vaccine I had my yearly bloodwork performed which showed low white blood cell and low platelet count.

About 1 week post injection, began getting chest pains, difficulty breathing, and dizziness/lightheadedness. We to urgent care 1 week after symptoms started to appear as they got worse.

                                                Immediately after I administered the vaccine, the patient passed out. He fell onto the floor and  we witnessed some oral seizure like type movement . The patient was unconscious for approximately  1.5-2 minutes.  Our Chief Medical Officer was on site and walking into the room as the patient fell. We immediately placed him on his left side, protected his head, and stayed with him.  We called 911 immediately due to the uncertainty of health issues. Once conscious, the patient explained to us that he experiences such every time he receives a vaccine. He was assessed by the CMO as well as the EMTs that arrived on scene.  His vitals were taken. He was moved into a comfortable position and monitored.  He was alert and orientated x 3.  We requested he have someone pick him up instead of him driving himself home which he did.  This gentleman is also an employee and we were able to see him and verify all was well in the following days. We also recommended he tell all vaccinators that he experiences  LOC post vaccination. When he receives his second dose  we plan to have him lying down and our CMO will be present.  We recommended he follow-up with his PCP.

                                                Patient has a history of syncope after vaccinations (last occurred with a vaccination 10 years ago) but did not state this prior to  receiving his first COVID-19 vaccine. About 1 minute after sitting down in the observation area, he fell to the ground and briefly lost consciousness. Multiple staff members came immediately to assess, rolled him over, and he immediately came to and was alert and oriented. He was taken to a medical area and laid down on a cot. He had unremarkable vitals and was breathing normally. He initially endorsed feeling lightheaded, but denied any other symptoms. He was given crackers and water given that he had not had much to eat or drink before the vaccination. He had a normal neurological exam. He was noted to have a superficial abrasion above and below the left eye (lower forehead and upper cheek), and a small Bandaid was  placed on the forehead. Fire rescue on site called EMS, who assessed him. There were no immediate concerns and he refused transportation to a hospital for further assessment.  After 1 hour had passed, the patient confirmed that he was feeling normal and he was allowed to leave. He was able to walk out of the facility of his own volition and did not have further symptoms when standing. His wife verified that she would drive him home. Prior to leaving, he was given strict instructions of reasons to seek immediate medical care should he have any new or worsening symptoms. The patient indicated understanding. Communication was performed via a Language Line medical interpreter.

Upon review of his lab results yesterday, I called the hematology fellow, Dr. through program at hospital and he recommended the labs to be obtained and rechecking labs in one week. He felt the student was not exhibiting any emergent symptoms requiring emergent evaluation. Patient and I spoke on phone after this call with fell at 1557 4/6 and I advised him to seek emergent medical eval in ED for any CP, SOB, HA or any neurologic symptoms. Patient has not had any of those symptoms. He exercised this morning without difficulty.   He notes raised papules on legs which he has had in past. They have currently been present for a few days. He believes it to be related to biking in sweatpants. He has been in a hot tub recently, but after the bumps were present. They do not itch. He has had them in past, more in winter months with heavier clothing.    He also notices slight left arm pain today. This was site of his vaccine. He denies any swollen lymph nodes.

So, she administered 50ml of liquid Benadryl to just get it into his system and then about 10 minutes later, it was not really having any effect and his tongue and stuff started tingling. She looked at his tongue and his tongue was starting to swell again. So, that&#39;s when she administered the EpiPen and 911 was called. Her husband was brought to the Emergency room again and was discharged a few hours later.

He cut his face.-Severe, Systemic: Seizure-Medium, Systemic: Shakiness-Medium, Additional Details: Pt told me he gets lightheaded after vaccines. I told him I&#39;d help him get to a chair near vaccination area so I could monitor him. He agreed. I didn&#39;t even have time to apply the bandage when he started twiching &amp; basically jumped out of his chair. He twisted 180 degrees and fell on his face. He got cut in at least 2 facial areas. Pharmacist cleaned him up. He never lost consciousness. EMS came and treated him. He refused to go to hospital at first, but eventually they took him.

                                                Last weekend on Sunday morning (April 25th), I received my second shot of Pfizer vaccine at 9am.  My body started to show some side effects on the evening of Sunday. I felt super cold around 10 pm and at the same time, I had a fever, too. I went to bed early that night (around 10:30 pm) and since I was super cold, I had 3-4 blankets on me when I was on my bed. Suddenly, at 1 am, I woke up due to a very strange noise in my head (a very low-volume noise of knocking on the door every 10 seconds!! I think it was only something in my mind). Since I couldn&#39;t sleep because of that low artificial noise, I decided to go to the bathroom at around 1:10 am (My bode was also in lots of pain at that time). When I started to walk, I realized that something is wrong with my body. When I peed and stood up to get back to my bed, I noticed that I&#39;m losing control! Therefore, I hit the bathroom door to wake up my girlfriend, and then I fainted! (I can&#39;t remember anything for about 30 seconds here). My girlfriend told me that when I fainted, one of my eyeballs was upward and the other was downward (like zombies!!). She started to freak out and called her mom, but once they started talking, I woke up. My body was soaking wet when I woke up and I was in lots of pain. I asked her to help me to lay down on the ground. After 10 minutes, that my sweats were gone, I started feeling cold and asked her to give me a blanket. I couldn&#39;t sleep for about 2-3 hours after I fainted, but I was feeling better (I was much better than the time before fainting). On Monday afternoon, I called the health center and told them my side effects. They strongly recommended visiting ER ASAP since the symptoms that I described were severe side effects of Pfizer. Therefore, I went to ER on Monday (April 26th) to see what?s the issue. Hopefully, after spending 3-4 hours there, and passing some tests, the results did not show anything wrong with my body, but just the side effects of the vaccine.

                                                Heart pain; Fever; Headache; Stomach ache; Difficulty to sleep; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 28-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 28-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 03May2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 28-years-old), administered in Arm Left on Apr2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced the normal symptoms like fever but it was just a mild fever, headache, stomach ache, and difficulty to sleep but the reason he is calling is because he was experiencing heart pain. He received the vaccine for protection on 03May2021 and for all the symptoms he had all started the same day he got the vaccine which all the symptoms started that night. The heart pain was only 10 minutes to 15 minutes that the pain lasted and it was painful but he relaxed himself and the pain went away by itself and he was not scared. He just laid down until the pain relieved and he took no medication. The outcome of the event heart pain was recovered on 03May2021, while for the rest of the events was recovered on 04May2021. The events were considered as non-serious by reporter. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional administered vaccines. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

On 5/15 in the hospital he was having a hard time breathing and they were trying to give him meds to make him better, they gave him antibiotics because his blood work showed infection, and Precedex to help him rest, and he passed away the same day, he was in good health before. They also said his heart rate was 201/123 and the doctors said pulmonary anema.  It escalated so quickly.

                                                In the weeks following the first dose of the vaccine I began experiencing near daily chest pain, primarily on the left side of my chest. I also felt that I was breathing heavier than normal while doing normal activities, such as walking or going up stairs. I also feel as if when my heart does get elevated my heart is thumping and beating much harder than normal. This is unusual for me as I am young and in very good shape. This also came with frequent panic attacks.

After the shot I took him to the waiting area to wait for 15 minutes.  After about 3 minutes, he lost consciousness and fell off of his chair.  After about a minute he came to and slowly got to his knees and came to and was able to sit back down in the chair.

Monday felt fevers and chills and malaise all day. Tuesday morning felt some retrosternal chest discomfort that lasted an hour or so and spontaneously went away. Was able to go to work all day and do fine. Works in a garage and lifts heavy tires. Yesterday took kids to day care, felt a little pain that morning which resolved. Picked them up in the evening and was going to hang out with them but had recurrence of pain and this time was quite severe. Tried to take some tylenol but threw this up. Came to the ED and had to wait 1-2 hours to be seen, but the time he was his pain had nearly resolved. Troponin taken around 10000. Cardiology consulted, think this might be reactivation / recurrence of his prior myopericarditis.&#34; H&amp;P 3/24/21  &#34;This is a 28 y.o. male with hx of post-viral myopericarditis in 2013 but otherwise healthy who presents for recurrence of myopericarditis incidentally not long after receiving 2nd COVID vaccine                         # Myopericarditis             Had episode of post-viral myopericarditis back in 2013, at which time he had an elevation of Trop I (non-HS variety) to 7.3 and echo showing basal inferolateral, basal inferior and mid inferolateral wall motion abnormalities but otherwise normal LV function. Has been highly functional. Recently got 2nd COVID vaccine and had fevers/chills after that.             Recurrent chest pain 3/24 w/o provocation, aborted on its own but has trop elevated to 10,000. EKG does not show STEMI and patient actually asymptomatic in ED. No infectious symptoms. Unclear but wonder if COVID vaccine could have caused recurrence of prior myopericarditis? Cards called in ED, they would like him admitted, to treat with colchicine and advil, repeat TTE and they will consult in the morning.&#34; A/P 3/24/21 from admission

After 10 min, Patient signled me (the pharmacist) that he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  As I approached, he stood up and started walking towards me.    I took his arm, we took two steps and he fainted.  I laid him to the ground while supporting his head.  He regained consciousness quickly, but was disoriented.   NP assisted by taking vitals/911 called.  Paramedics arrived and then took over evaluation.  Pt was taken to ambulance for further evaluation, as he still could not walk to diziness.

These symptoms were resolved the next day (5/15), but that night I had an intense episode of chest pain that lasted 5-7 hours.  These symptoms went away and then returned again for a second time (5/17) around 4am for around 3-4 hours, while flying back.  I went to the hospital and had concerns from doctors over my ECG and raised troponin levels.  I spent 2 nights in the hospital and was diagnosed with Myocarditis.  This was then validated through an MRI the following day.  I am now resting at home for 3 months and taking ibuprofen.

                                                Immediately after administering the vaccine, the patient was asked how he felt. Patient stated he felt &#34;Okay&#34;. Patient was informed of possible side effect he might experience from the vaccine. After, being informed of possible side effects, the patient was asked how he felt; the patient stated &#34;okay&#34;. The patient walked from the vaccination room to a chair in the waiting area and sat down. After a couple minutes the patient was asked again how he felt. He stated &#34;Okay&#34;. After approximately 10 minutes after administration of vaccine the patient moved from the chair he had been sitting in to one closer to the pharmacy. The patient was asked again how he felt; the patient stated, &#34;I&#39;m starting to feel funny.&#34; Patient was asked if he wanted water. He stated, &#34;Yes&#34;. A second pharmacist was asked for assistance when the first was getting water. The patient was given an ice pack along with the water. The ice pack was placed on the back of the patient?s neck while he was sitting in the chair. The second pharmacist grabbed a blood pressure cuff to check the patient&#39;s blood pressure. The patient stated, ?I feel like I?m going to pass out.? While the second pharmacist checked the patient?s blood pressure, the first pharmacist went to get the Nurse Practitioner from the Convenient Care within the store for assistance with the patient. While the first pharmacist was getting the nurse practitioner, the patient passed out and was not responding to the second pharmacist. The third pharmacist on staff immediately called 911 for assistance. The nurse practitioner and first pharmacist arrived back to the patient. The nurse practitioner rubbed the patient?s sternum and checked for his blood pressure and pulse. The patient?s legs were raised and placed on a second chair. The patient regained consciousness. The patient was very pale and sweating. He was alert and could answer questions. After a few minutes emergency services arrived. They talked with the patient for roughly 10-15 minutes. After that the paramedics left and had the patient remain for a few more minutes. The patient?s wife was with him and they left the store at 1:59pm.

However, I was having heart problem that day around at least 15 minutes after my second vaccination.  My heart felt stretching and beating too fast.  I didn&#39;t report at that time because my Lyft ride just arrived at the same time and I decided to take the ride back home.  My heart was  hurting for two days.  I also developed light fever around before midnight that same day of vaccination but recovered the following day through medicine and rest.

It would hurt to inhale and exhale and I was short of breath, possibly due to the not being able to inhale without pain. Breathing was shallow as to not cause pain. I administered hydrocodone 15 mg PO q6h for pain. I told my pulmonologist who stated it sounded like pleuritis. He stated I should go to the hospital if the pain comes back . I admit I did not follow this order as I felt the pain med resolved it and did not want to go to an ER if it wasn?t critical. The chest pain lasted 96 hours and then resolved . The pain was severe enough to wake me from my sleep multiple times. That was the only AE associated with the first shot . The second shot had many more side effects , Severe nausea , emesis , diarrhea , migraine headache , high fever , shaking , and sinus discharge. The chest pain also came back and I did the same regiment of pain meds to treat the severe pain. These side effects lasted 7 days and then resolved .

I was able to speak with an advice Nurse ordered an EKG from the suggestion of another doctor. I was placed on a heart monitor for two weeks and my heart beat seemed to be normal. Another test was ran that was not related to the heart symptoms that I experienced and it was not helpful. I will be going to do a blood test to access whether there is something going on in my blood that&#39;s related to the palpitations that I am currently experiencing (symptoms went away for two weeks and recently came back).

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I started feeling hyperaware. For example, my wife smokes but not around me and for the first time, I could smell cigarettes in the car. Also, my dog who is rather clean, I could smell which is not usual. I had back pain. My tongue felt tingly and numb, my blood pressure was at around 150, my heart rate was at around 116. This persisted for about 30 mins or so. I was sent to the ER and was there for about 6 hours. Since the vaccine, I could be doing nothing, and I?d have random bouts of extremely high heart rate. For about a month after the vaccine I had trouble doing even the most mundane tasks. I was first put on metoprolol for about 2 weeks. I was put on a Holter monitor so I had to stop taking it. I was then switched to atenolol which has helped since. After the vaccine, I was going to the bathroom once every 4 days which was unusual for me. It was also yellow which was abnormal for me. I also lost about 20 lbs in this time frame which my doctor credited due to the elevated heart rate. I had to take time off from work because walking from my car to my office was exhausting for me. I was on atenolol which definitely helped but my doctor suggests that I take half a pill. Taking half a pill does not help with the heart rate compared to the original dosage. My most recent episode of elevated heart rate was about 3 weeks ago. I am also on omeprazole which I am not certain if it is helpful. I also am experiencing random muscle pains on the left side of my body. My doctor also credits some of these symptoms to anxiety which I have never experienced before. Essentially, for the first 1-2 months, my heart rate was extremely high but after the atenolol, it has returned to normal. In the ambulance the paramedic noted that when I was lying still my heart rate was normal but when I would move or talk my heart rate would jump up.  Also, just to note, after receiving my vaccine I interacted with my cousin who I later found out had COVID.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

A 29-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EK4176) in the hospital, via intramuscular route on 10Feb2021 at 10:30 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from 2010 to 2011 and allergies to penicillin on an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination, was the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: H9899) in the hospital, via intramuscular route at 01:15 PM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that on 12Feb2021 at 08:00 PM (also reported as &#39;3 days after injection&#39;) the patient experienced flu-like symptoms that included fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, and a persistent headache. On 13Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 4th day&#39;, the patient developed pleurisy and difficulty breathing and had 2 syncope events the morning of 14Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 5th day&#39;). The patient was taken by ambulance and admitted to ER for further testing. It was determined that all symptoms likely related to the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine recently received. Pleurisy persists one week following vaccine dose. The patient went to the emergency room/department or urgent care due to the events. As treatment for the event, the patient was monitored and given IV fluids over 12 hour stay in CDU. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae (reported as recovered with lasting effects). The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile.

                                                After leaving the vaccination clinic following the 15 minute waiting period, I felt normal and ran a quick errand before returning to work. After completing the errand (roughly 15 minutes), I began driving back to my office (roughly 10 minute drive). As I was roughly 1/2 mile from the office, I started to feel slightly lightheaded/woozy. I continued to drive toward the office, and within a matter of a couple minutes or less, I was overcome with extreme disorientation and faintness. Before I could manage to return to the office or pull over to collect myself, I completely lost consciousness and crashed into another vehicle. Even after the crash, I was unconscious for roughly a minute or so until I finally came to and realized what had happened. It then took me another couple of minutes to collect myself and exit the vehicle to assess the situation and ensure all parties were alright. Police/Emergency services were contacted and a police report was filed. After the event, I remained slightly nauseated for approximately 3 hours and had intermittent chill episodes, but the adverse events have since subsided.

                                                I felt soreness and pressure build up in my arm starting a few hours after the receiving the dose. The soreness and pressure got progressively worse over the course of two days. It wasn&#39;t unbearable, just uncomfortable. The second day after the vaccine I had stretched my arm pretty good for minute, when I released the stretch I felt a rush of something for from my arm into my torso. I got really dizzy and passed out, my wife was in the room at the time and said I never closed my eyes; but I had completely blacked out. My wife had woken me up and I wasn&#39;t sure what had happened, it took me about 30 seconds to realize I had passed out after stretching that arm. My arm had felt better after waking up from passing out, and soreness had passed a couple days later. I didn&#39;t get checked out,  after I woke up I started feeling fine.  I&#39;m honestly not sure if it&#39;s directly related to the vaccine or not, I just thought I should let someone know just in case.

                                                Patient fainted approximately three minutes after his vaccination. He regained consciousness immediately and we moved him to the floor with his feet elevated. We asked him a series of questions to assess his health. He was pale and sweaty but his blood pressure and pulse were stable. We monitored him for roughly 20 minutes after the incident while continuously checking his pulse and blood pressure. He denied any further intervention/assistance and insisted that he felt fine. He left on his own accord.

                                                I began experiencing chest tightness/pain (initially concentrated on left side) some hours after receiving the vaccine. Two days later, I visited the hospital and all heart/blood tests appeared OK. It is now a week out and chest discomfort continues?it has manifested itself in other parts of my chest as well and is more present at certain times than others (e.g. when taking a deep breath). Minor shortness of breath. My primary care provider advises it may be costochondritis. Note: I had COVID-19 in late March.

                                                Support staff checking in patients outside the building witnessed a patient passing out at the top of the walkway. One person ran inside to get the clinic coordinator.  She immediately asked staff to call EMS and she ran out to assess the situation.  The patient was lying on his side motionless.  She attempted to rouse the patient and assess if CPR was needed.  The patient opened his eyes and looked dazed and confused.  He rolled on his back.  He began to verbally respond and apologized for passing out.  He stated that this happens to him frequently when he gets an immunization or blood drawn.  He had abrasions and a small contusion on the left side of his face in the temple region with a small amount of blood and dirt from hitting the sidewalk. She was joined by NP and NP along with 2 medical assistants. While waiting to EMS to arrive, campus police came on the scene to help direct EMS whenever they arrived.   Vitals were taken BP 140/70  HR 62  2:30 PM .  An ice pack was applied to his head.  Additional information on the patient?s identity was acquired.  Patient was alert and oriented.  Patient had his cellphone and attempted to call his wife with no answer.  He also sent her a text.  EMS arrived on the scene.  Patient?s wife called and she apprised her of the situation as EMS assessed the patient.  After their examination, EMS declined to transport the patient due to the patient&#39;s narrative of this situation occurring frequently.  They advised him to follow-up with his MD and left the scene. Clinic staff and campus police stayed on the scene until the patient?s wife arrived.  She was advised to take him immediately to the ED to be assessed for a head injury.  Wife drove patient to hospital.   She called the patient later that evening.  Patient stated he was thoroughly examined for a potential head injury and was cleared.  He was given information on interventions he can try to use to avoid a severe vasovagal incident in the future.  Patient was cleared to get his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                I received the 1st shot of the pfizer covid vaccine on March 11, 2021. Within 2 days I began to feel extremely fatigued. The days following I experienced night sweats, nausea, extreme fatigue, fever. I went to urgent care with a 102 fever, jaundice, and anemia. Urgent care sent me to the ER. At the ER they admitted me to the hospital. I was in the hospital for 3 days with hemolytic anemia. After a lot of testing and ruling out any infections, they discovered I have a rare blood disorder: hereditary elliptocytosis. The pfizer vaccine created an immune response and since I have this blood disorder I was predisposed to this event occurring from the vaccine (hemolytic anemia/juandice) without knowing it. It was a result of the vaccine. I was told to not get the second shot because there is no guidance, but that I am a high risk individual now. I need medical advice from people who are familiar and know.

I ran outside of the pharmacy to assist him. He was conscious but confused for a few moments. Then said he felt fine. Patient showed no signs of allergic reaction. I asked him if he had any injuries/bleeding and he said no. I asked him to stay at the pharmacy for another 30 minutes so I could observe him closely. We gave him a cup of cool water to sip on. At around 1:10 pm, I went outside the pharmacy to check on him again and he said he felt flushed and asked for a bucket.  At 1:15 pm, he vomited into the bucket. He said he felt 100% better after vomiting. I had him stay at pharmacy until shortly after 1:30 pm when he said he felt okay to go home. I called him at home around pm the same day and he said he felt fine.

                                                For the duration of a couple weeks after the second Pfizer shot, I sporadically would experience moderate heart palpitations, chest pains, and chest feeling heavy.   These symptoms would occur randomly throughout the day (typically when not doing any physical activity - i.e. driving in car or sitting on couch) and would last for several minutes.  It never got severe enough to the point where I went to see a doctor.  It has been 17 days since the second shot and I feel better and haven&#39;t experienced the pains in a couple days.

                                                I am an internal medicine resident at a hospital.  By the end of one my call days I started having substernal chest pain, non radiating that was worsened with breathing. I initially thought it was heartburn so I took tumms followed by PPI without any improvement. The pain continued to worsen so I did a quick bedside echocardiogram on myself (poor quality probe), however did not appreciate any effusion, wall motion abnormalities or change in EF. I continued my shift and went home in poor shape unable to speak due to pain on deep breathing. When I laid on my bed the pain worsened significantly and improved when sitting up, so I suspected pericarditis and started NSAIDs. Symptoms improved significantly the following morning and resolved in 36-48 hours with the NSAID course. I never did an EKG to confirm the diagnosis and was never started on anything other than the NSAID course due to uncertain diagnosis. After hearing concerns with myocarditis with pfizer I thought I would report my case knowing it is nearly 2 months after vaccination and there is no definitive diagnosis.

                                                Day after vaccine, I was sick all day. Hard to breathe; heart rate would shoot up and then come down in one minutes sessions; I had body aches - all over. Doing anything felt painful. Eating was uncomfortable and sitting was uncomfortable. I had some fever. 238.5 Celsius and it got a little worse during the day (and that number is the end of the day). I had some pain in the chest, too - center of chest. I also had a headache throughout the day. I did a televisit (wednesday)  and she advised to take acetaminophen for fever. She said my blood pressure was fine and my heart rate was still under 100 most of the time. The next day, everything seemed fine - all symptoms seemed to go over night except heart rate - still was elevated and the difficulty breathing was still there. Even sitting - my breathing and heartrate felt like it was working. Friday, things were mostly similar - heart rate came mostly down. But end of day, difficulty breathing came worse and chest pain became worse and tightening of chest was more intense. No fever after Wed though. I went to see the Urgent Care doctor at Urgent Care. Friday, the second week after the vaccine, the symptoms received. Pain in left arm started (started Tuesday or Wed the second week)  and I had chest pain and tightness in the chest and slight difficulty breathing, nausea, dizziness and no fever.  ER - on Saturday - 11:30PM - they did more tests - everything heart related came back fine so they ruled out Heart attack; but didnt&#39; know what it was; gave medication for nausea in case it would help. IV medication and then one medicine to drink on the spot. It didn&#39;t really help - the symptoms continued and slowly disappeared the next day (the second Sunday after the vaccine). Nothing new since then.

                                                There is a small, weak, shooting pain in my chest around the area of my heart. It lasts for about half a minute to a full minute before dispersing. It rarely happens and so far, it has been about once daily. My left arm is also experiencing a weak, dull pain on the outer side of my bicep. It starts in the middle and goes down to the elbow. It sticks around for a while but it did not start until 07/09/2021.

                                                Patient received his 1 dose of Pfizer vaccine and was waiting in our lobby for the recommended 15 minutes. He fainted after about 10 minutes. He fell from the bench to the floor where he landed on his stomach. When I ran over to him, his eyes were open but his body was limp. I tapped his back and asked if he was ok, and he was startled as if I woke him up from sleep. He was alert and was able to speak, he asked for water and I gave it to him. I asked of he wanted me to call emergency services but he declined. He then vomited in the waiting room trash can. His sister was with him and began to rub his back and fan him. I asked again if he needed to go to the hospital and again her declined. I told them to please wait in the lobby at least another 15 minutes before leaving and he did. I called to patient around 8pm to check on him and he said he was fine and had no more symptoms.

                                                After getting the vaccine in my left arm, I walked to observation area and sat down in chair. Within a minute or so, I noticed my heart rate was slightly elevated and had a strange feeling of unease. Roughly 3-5 minutes later symptoms appeared and I noticed my palms were sweating and I had slightly blurred vision. At this point, I called for a paramedic and told them I wasn?t feeling well. They arrived nearly 15 seconds later (paramedics were stationed all throughout observation area). Symptom severity dramatically increased (very blurred vision, feeling of something clearly being wrong) and was added by a ringing sound in both ears. I was helped into a wheel chair and rolled into an enclosed area with a curtain around for privacy. Gatorade was offered to me and I took a few sips and felt very mildly better. Paramedics reported that my blood pressure was extremely low (63/28). They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. Symptoms were the same and starting to very slightly get better from the Gatorade so I said let?s wait a few minutes to see how I feel. At this point they took my blood sugar measurement and found that it was also very low (53mg). They gave me some intravenous fluids and a glucose substance that was in a tube (sort of like toothpaste) and within another five minutes I felt considerably better. I received the IV treatment for roughly 20 minutes and symptoms progressively got better over the course of the treatment. My blood pressure went back up to 117/80 and my blood sugar went up to a more normal level as well (I believe they said somewhere in the 90s or low 100?s). After they removed the IV and blood pressure monitor, I rested for roughly 20 minutes before walking to my car and driving home.

                                                Approximately 2 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient lost consciousness while driving to observation. He continued traveling through the barricades, hit a curb and ran into a light pole and secondarily hit a tree with the back end of his car. He immediately regained consciousness and denied having any head, neck, or back pain. He relayed that he is terrified of needles and shots, and has a history of passing out from receiving shots in the past. He also informed us that he has not had anything to eat or drink since dinner the night before. His vitals were as follows: BP 123/87, HR 104, EKG; Normal Sinus Rhythm. His girlfriend was in the backseat without a seatbelt and she had a hematoma on her forehead. Her vitals were: BP 138/90, HR 98, GCS-15. They both denied transport to the hospital and relayed that they would wait for the tow truck and seek medical evaluation at an urgent care center after.

                                                At approximately 4:30pm, on the day I got the vaccine, I began to feel the effects of Encephalopathy and Encephalitis, in which I began to feel pressure in my skull, and felt confusional thinking. It became hard to discern my thoughts. I also, began to experience a difficult time with my vision not being able to control what my vision was focusing on, as well as seeing a blue tint in my vision. I am also experiencing mild pressure and aches on the right side of my back and left side of my chest. These effects have been continuous for the last 4 days. To treat these symptoms I have been using natural remedies, and have maintained a stable condition due to that.

I had him sit down in the counseling room. 911 was called and ems was dispatched. in the mean time store management brought him water. I asked the patient again if he was having difficulty breathing and he said no, but he felt dizzy and his heart rate was elevated. I asked him if he had any difficulty swallowing, or any swelling of the lips, tongue, mouth or throat - pt denied all symptoms. patient also denied a rash or any itching when asked. I also asked the patient if he had any nausea, which he stated he did. he continued to deny all symptoms except dizziness, and nausea when asked, and in talking to him while waiting for emt he never displayed any symptoms that would lead me to believe he was having difficulty breathing, or a true allergic reaction. when emt arrived and examined him his pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation was normal, and the patient stated he felt better and had a history of anxiety. patient declined to go to the hospital, waited in the pharmacy for a while longer, and had a friend come pick him up

                                                Post receiving the Pfizer vaccine within 15 minutes patient had a near syncopal episode (lightheaded, faint, dizzy, with N/V). Patient was put on a stretcher, recumbent position. Feelings of lightheadedness/vertigo almost resolved but with every attempt to elevate the head lightheadedness/vertigo returned (over a span of 45 minutes). Since patient could not be progressed to a sitting position  without being symptomatic 911 was called. EMS evaluated and transported patient to Hospital at 5:50 PM.

                                                I&#39;m really hoping to get some guidance as I seem to be having a very strange reaction to the vaccine. Approximately 2 weeks from my 1st vaccine on 3/16/2021; I had sudden panic attacks. I never had a panic attack or anxiety before. Following the panic attacks, I have been struggling with several major symptoms: no appetite/ loss of appetite, chronic headache(almost daily), GI problems, and most noteworthy, daily inexplicable waves of anxiety and worry.  As mentioned, I have no history of anxiety or panic attacks. I also am experiencing chills, sweating, shaking, and a lot of brain fog/ inability to concentrate. The symptoms did start to subside to some degree, but as of today (4/24/21) I had more sudden and inexplicable rushes of anxiety and panic. Some other symptoms are an elevated resting heart rate and higher than usual blood pressure. I have also been waking from sleep suddenly with a feeling of jitteriness in my chest and palpitations. I have had trouble sleeping and almost feel like a rush of adrenaline hits me right before I start to fall asleep. I received my 2nd vaccine on 4/6/2021 because I didn&#39;t think these could be related to the vaccine. I&#39;m seeing many people online mentioning similar reactions after getting their Pfizer vaccine.

                                                A couple hours after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I suddenly passed out (syncope) and hit my head as I lost consciousness while home alone. I went to the ER where blood, urine, and orthostatic tests were performed. Head injury was mild and without compilation. I was given an IV for fluids to recover from dehydration and then discharged.

He informed me at the time of his second dose. He stated he wanted to get the second shot but the doctor who treated him advised him not too.  I told him to delay until further consultation with same doctor or a 2nd consultation with another doctor.

It looked as if he had slightly hit shoulder first with no obvious head injuries. He came to in about 5 seconds in which he mentioned the fact passing out had happened to him before and was common with shots. The paramedics quickly attended to him and took blood pressure which came back normal. He denied transport by ambulance.

I took myself to the hospital who confirmed that hemorrhaging and blood clots had formed behind the site of my old ostomy scar inside of my intestines. I had no other signs of ulcerative colitis when scoped and no active flare, only this clotting that arose specifically after this second vaccine dose.

                                                About 5 hours after my second shot of Pfizer, I started to experience aches and a low-grade fever in addition to sinus pressure (unsure if this is related or just allergies). I went to bed and woke up feeling nauseous about 10 hours post-shot. Figuring I might need to throw up, I walked down the stairs to the bathroom and woke up on the floor of the bathroom after experiencing a seizure for 1-2 minutes. Paramedics came shortly after and my vital symptoms were normal. I have a history of vasovagal-syncope syndrome and have fainted several times, but have not experienced an episode in about 6 years. On day 2, I experienced more normal side effects like a low-grade fever, aches and a headache.

A few minutes later, my pharmacy technician, was informed that patient had collapsed in front of the pharmacy. I was in the immunization room with another patient. I grabbed an Epinephrine 0.3mg auto injector and went to the patient. He was unconscious and unresponsive. I told him to call 911 and to send for paramedics. I administered one dose of 0.3mg epinephrine and patient woke up within a few seconds. He stayed sitting with me assisting as this was his most comfortable position. He later transferred to a chair and paramedics/emt took over when they arrived.

He was laid on floor, feet elevated and ice pack applied to this neck. After about 2 minutes, he said he felt better. Color started coming back to his face. He was then helped to a chair. He took a couple of sips of water. Said he was feeling better now than when he came in. After about 6 minutes his color had returned to normal for him. He was talking and joking with his girlfriend. Ask him to remain for 15 more minutes to make sure he did not have any other effects. Told him that we would call him tomorrow and check on him. Left after 15 minutes.

Upon deciding that he had not received any of the vaccine, I administered a second dose bc the hub was split all the way down.   I administered it and left him to go wash my hands.  After about a minute, we heard a loud sound.  When I got to him, he was getting up and was pale. His face was white, hands clammy and sweating.  He did not remember falling.  I took his bp which was 99/65.  My tech went and got him some water.  He started drinking and then vomited.  He said he immediately felt better.  his girlfriend went and got him some juice.  He sat there for about 15 more minutes.  He sated that he felt fine, but he had not had anything to eat or drink that morning.  (also a beer the night before).  He got up and walked out without any help and was going to get him something to eat.  He was hungry.

                                                After the pt received the vaccine, he asked me for some water because he wasn&#39;t feeling very well. I didn&#39;t have any on hand, so I offered chocolate. When I came back he tried to reach for it, but was struggling. He dropped it and started making jerking movements and slumping over. I put my hand on his chest to keep him propped up and called for my technician. After a minute or so, he was responsive, but sweating and his skin tone became washed out. I told him he should lay on the floor and prop his feet up on the chair. He said that made him feel better. I got him some orange juice to drink after he got off the floor. He remained near the location for 30mins and then did some shopping to make sure he would be okay before leaving with his wife.

                                                About 6 days after the first shot I experienced a sudden chest tightness that I never experienced before. The tightness was severe enough that it prompted me to schedule a visit to a cardiologist that same week. My breathing was not affected but the constant tightness made me fearful as I am a normal and healthy adult otherwise and never experienced chest/heart issue in the past. The tightness seemed to improve with ingestion of Ibuprofin.

                                                Light headedness, weakness, and subjective fever onset during the morning of 6/6 following injection of second COVID-Pfizer vaccine on 6/4 at approx. 4:30 p.m, and the initial even also included minor muscular spasms, headache, heartburn, and abdominal pain. These symptoms worsened throughout the day. My pulse felt weak. My breathing became rapid and shallow, even though it was not difficult to draw breath. The major symptoms on 6/7 were headache, with a sense of my motion being affected. My urine throughout this time was excessively dark, even though I was drinking more water than normal. The following day, 6/8, most of my joints began to heart, and I became very stiff; this sx lessened after taking a long, slow walk.  On 6/13 another event involving slowed heart rate, subjectively weak pulse, and shortness of breath ensued. There had been no unusual or excessive physical activity, and as I had not experienced this phenomenon before receiving the second vaccine dose on 6/4, I believe that the 6/13 event was also linked to the vaccination.

                                                About 2 days after the vaccination I began to have chest pain that would not go away unless I leaned forward. It hurt all the time for about 7 days and went away gradually. I believe it to me myocarditis. As well as the above reaction, my migraine frequency went up noticeably from around 10 days a month to 15 or 20. This has not shown any sign of abating and seems to be permanent. Please note that the heart issue went away but the migraine problem definitely has not.

On the night of May 5th pain started to increase and decided to report to the hospital. On May 6th I was admitted to the hospital to further identify what was causing the shoulder pain, deferent test were performed with normal result but upon performing CT Scan, it was identify that I had blood clots on the left lung (pulmonary embolism). Upon several questions asked by the health care team, the doctors at the Hospital stated that the main cause of the blood cloths was the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine due to my healthy status and being the only thing that I had completed different in the days prior to the hospitalization. Due to this I was prescribed a 3 month anti coagulant treatment for the embolism.

Seen by cardiologist,  Zio patch monitoring showed PVC?s, echocardiogram with EF 50% which is borderline low. Cardiac MRI confirmed myocarditis. Subsequent blood work was completely negative.  Presumed myocarditis as a side effect of Pfizer vaccination per discussion with cardiologist.

I was immediately monitored and administered a normal dose of Benadryl where I waited upwards of 1 hour for the symptoms to wear off. All remaining minor symptoms were gone by next day. I&#39;ve developed pin-pointed neck pain limiting my range of motion within 2 days after the injection. Pain still persists today. No other symptoms. PCP recommended against getting the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                I had the vaccine on 06/22/2021. What brought me in was nasal congestion, ear pain, no fever, sore throat, runny nose and a little bit of chest tightness. I went to urgent care the following day on 06/23/2021, I went to get a Covid test that day and it was negative. Basically, they said my ears looked fine, my lungs sounded fine, my throat seemed a little bit red but was fine. They said to come back if the symptoms persisted. I was getting progressively worse through out the week to where my throat was in pain, I started taking allergy medicine and that did not impacted my symptoms. After several days of getting progressively worse, on 06/27/21 I went back and they told me I had swollen lymph nodes under my jaw and a lot of fluid in my right ear which was causing the ear pain but my lungs sounded fine but my sore throat was extremely red. She felt that it was probably not related to the vaccine because of how far it was from when I got it. She prescribed Erythromycin thinking it was a bacterial infection. I been on the course on that since Sunday. I am definitely improving but I am still pretty well congested but my ear pain has resolved.

After this attack the pain continued for another couple of days until it went away.  It&#39;s now been about 18 days since the shot and I experienced another mini attack now. I just had a coffee (less than 30 min ago) and ate stake and fries for lunch (2 hours ago).

                                                8 days post-vaccine I woke up with shortness of breath and mind racing that turned into heart attack-like symptoms (shooting pain down left arm, couldn?t breathe, fear of death, lightheaded) and to call ambulance. Cardiologist said that I had inflammation around my heart. Since the medical event I have had four others. Notably, I have never had a history of these types of attacks and they started happening 8 days after first vaccine shot. I am 30 years old, 5?10?, 170 pounds. The vaccine has to have been the cause of these as lifestyle hasn?t changed one bit since vaccination.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

                                                I felt fine the rest of yesterday but started to feel really tired and worn down late last night. I took my sleeping pill like normal and went to bed. I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

The patient got the vaccine and was told to have a seat outside the immunization room for 15 minutes at least to ensure no side effects. The patient wanted to get something in the store. Pharmacist was immunizing the next patient already. Patient knocked on the door and stated he didn&#39;t feel good and was dizzy. I told him  to take a seat I was going to get him some water. As he was about to sit down he passed out and hit the door with his head. EMS was called and patient was taken to hospital. The patient woke up 30 seconds after and was dizzy. He felt better after about 5 minutes.

This was 5-15 minutes post vaccination as he was being observed. We laid him on the ground and he immediately started to feel better. After a few minutes he sat up and drank some orange juice.

He was attended to by RNs who checked his blood pressure and pulse. His BP was 60/30 and his pulse was in the 40s. He was laid flat with his feet up. His blood pressure was then rechecked a few minutes later and it had come up to 102/60. His pupils constricted back to a normal size and he said he was feeling better. He was given water to drink, observed for 30 minutes and walked out to his car by an RN after 30 minutes of observation. He did report that he does this with all vaccines. He was driven home by another driver.

Approximately five minutes later he mentioned to his female colleague who was with him that he felt feverish and sweaty and when he reached over to get a drink from his water bottle he fell over and passed out for a few seconds.  By the time I ran out to check on him he was already getting up and I had him sit in the chair while my technician called 9-1-1.  The paramedics soon came out (I think it was about 10 minutes) and checked him out.  Both theirs and my IR thermometers showed a normal temperature.  His BP was normal according to the paramedics.  They asked some more questions and ultimately let him go home under his own power with his female cohort.

However, it persisted throughout the day.  Typically when I was up and moving.  However, usually in low 90s when just up and moving.  I cross 100 when I&#39;m doing yard work or doing light exercise.  Last night when going to bed I was in lower 80s, when usually I&#39;m in lower 70s upper 60s at bed time.  Today, I haven&#39;t crossed 100 as much, but have been taking it easy.

I laid down and called a  nurse adviser. I was recommended to go to ER, so my wife took me to ER. They did CT scan of my head, then CT scan of my head and neck with contrast, then MRI of my head, then MRI of my head and neck with contrast. It was confirmed that I had an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE. It was decided to perform carotid endarterectomy surgery to remove a clot in the neck carotid artery. The clot was removed.

                                                On 4/19 he received the first dose of Pfizer vaccine oh 4 PM.  Administration of vaccine was uneventful.  The next day he noticed sore shoulder at 3 PM on 4/20 he noted he had upper wrist pain that progressed to his right thumb as well as redness with a shiny quality that was consistent with previous gout flares so he took 2 doses of colchicine and 2 doses of Advil which did not relieve his symptoms.  A couple hours later he noted hand numbness and tingling as well as feet numbness and tingling bilaterally.  The numbness progressed to his extremities with the left arm more affected than the right arm (he received vaccine in his left arm).  He had accompanied pain of his extremities and wrists that was described as 10 out of 10.  He then felt 2 episodes of chest tightness and difficulty breathing prompting him to present to the strong ED.  In the ED his exam was notable for hypertension (240/90), tachycardia, wrist flexion in distress and yelling in pain.  His exam also showed bilateral hyperflexion of bilateral wrist with mild swelling and diminished sensation and motor function throughout.  He was administered IV hydromorphone, and Benadryl with dramatic improvement in his symptoms.  His labs are notable for abnormal electrolytes including magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium and he was repleted with magnesium potassium and phosphorus.  He is admitted to ED OBS. overall felt his symptoms were most likely due to gout flare and hyperventilation, not likely related to vaccine.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine, I felt very tired and winded as if I was working out for hours on no food. I did eat that day. I felt dizzy and saw black dots in my vision and felt the need to sit down. I never made it to sit, rather fell flat on my face and passed out for a few moments before my cousin came and picked me up asking what happened. It was very embarrassing and I believe the fall on my face caused an infection in my jawline on the left side and a sinus infection. I was throwing up and blowing my nose from blood. Very scary sight to see.

Pharmacist tried to wake him by asking his name and touching his shoulder. His wife was doing the same and patient remained unconscious.  Pharmacist had another  employee in the room call 911 while she administered 0.3 mg Epi Pen in left thigh. Patient finally came to and pharmacist lowered patient to the floor so that he was positioned lying down with his knees up. Heart rate was at 45, O2 saturation at 87, BP 128/90.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 19Apr2021, this case now contains serious adverse reaction. Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) via Medical Information team. A 31-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were not reported) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was in excellent health and had no known allergies. The patient had took the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 18 days prior reporting (on 01Apr2021) and had blood pressure dropped to 70/50 and emergency medical services (EMS) was called an hour with him. The reporter was asking if the patient should take the second dose being that he had this reaction. The reporter further asked for the efficacy of one dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and how long was the coverage of the vaccine as far as needing a booster shot. The reporter also asked about the 6 months topline analysis results of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It was further reported that fifteen minutes after the COVID-19 shot on 01Apr2021, the patient passed out; the patient had a big blood pressure drop from 110/90 to 70/50. The EMS was called in and attended to the patient. The patient was there for about an hour. The reporter was just calling to find out if the patient could get the second shot. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

That frightened me and boosted my adrenaline so I was able to drive to my home but the whole time I was fighting to stay conscious.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS NORMAL SIDE EFFECT. I COULD NOT WALK AROUND THE BLOCK WITHOUT RUNNING OUT OF BREATH. SYMPTOMS LASTED AN ENTIRE MONTH. AFTER SECOND DOSE, THE VACCINE CLINIC RECOMMENDED I CALL MY DOCTOR. DOCTOR ADVISED I GO TO ER. 2 DAYS LATER, I GO TO ER. I STAY IN ER FOR 3 DAYS WHILE THEY RUN TESTS. I AM DISCHARGED ON 3/9/21. COINCIDENTALLY, THAT WAS WHEN CHEST PAINS STARTED. I HAVE HAD CHEST PAINS EVER SINCE. I HAVE VISITED DOCTORS, AND HAVE TAKEN TESTS, AND HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PERICARDITIS.

Massive tension headache and pressure behind eyes and sinus that has lasted so far for 3 weeks, tinnitus, blurred vision, joint pain, muscle weakness, muscle twitching in face and throughout body, numbness in all my limbs, burning sensations on my neck and back, stomach pain, and heart palpitations that sent me to the ER. When I walk and move my arms I feel weak. The vaccine has effected my nervous system in a terrible way. The ER doctor, ENT, PCP, Optometrist, and Opthamologist told me it was inflammation due to the vaccine. I was prescribed 6 days prednisone, 40mg for 2 days then taper down and they put me in a &#34;let&#39;s wait and see&#34; mode. All symptoms have persisted since. I follow-up with a cardiologist on 05/14/2021 and waiting appt for a neuro ophthalmologist.

Along with this has been continuous (seemingly non-stop, as the issue has not been resolved) muscle spasms.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 I got the 2nd shot around 3pm and felt fine throughout the rest of the day. Around 10pm when I started feeling feverish. Around 11pm, while laying in bed, it started getting much worse - shaking uncontrollably, feeling nauseous, very dizzy, fever - flu like symptoms which seemed normal for the vaccine, but then they got much worse and very strong. I couldn&#39;t fall asleep and at 1am I got out of bed to get tylenol. I took the tylenol and was still feeling naeusous so went to the bathroom. I don&#39;t remember what happened next because I fainted and woke up on the floor. I hit my head in the fall and head to get 4 staples and  had a laceration above my eye. I think I may have fainted again shortly after that but don&#39;t remember because I was out of it. I went to the ER - all tests came back normal at that point. I had covid about 2 months before the vaccine. I had no side effects from the first shot.

                                                Patient received Covid-19 Vaccine (Pfizer). When pt stood up to walk out to immunization waiting area, he sat on the floor and stated that he was feeling lightheaded. Within 15 seconds, the patient fainted. Myself, a family member, and my certified immunization technician assisted the patient. A code white was called and so were EMS. My technician and I held the pt&#39;s feet above his head and laid him flat on his back to encourage blood flow back to his brain. He was unconscious for about 15 seconds before he woke up. When he woke, he stated that he often faints during/after seeing a needle and this is normal for him. Regardless, we awaited EMS&#39; arrival. EMS checked on the patient and determined he was safe to go home after his 20 min wait period. Patient declined going to hospital for examination as this happens to him often. He was monitored by myself and the store manager and was given water during his 15 minute post-vaccination monitoring.

                                                This is reported by his mother.    Around 10:00 AM he got his vaccine.  Mother met him at 12:30 and went to lunch, said he felt OK.  She stayed with him a couple of hours, went home and apparently he went to sleep.  The next day he texted his mother and said that he felt yucky.  She told him to give it a couple of days, and he went to work all week, but said that after he ate he felt &#34;funny&#34;.  Then on Sunday, Mother&#39;s day on 5/9/21 and they face timed and was supposed to meet him at 5:30.  At 12:45 he had finished eating, ate some enchilladas and said that he felt weird.  He said that he was going to be ok to meet him at 5:30.  At 4:37 PM she texted him to say that she was on her way to meet him.  She got at the meeting place at 5:30 and he was usually there before her, this is a normal weekend ritual to exchange his dog.  She waited 9 minutes and she tried to facetime him thinking he was in traffic, and he didn&#39;t answer.  She thought he was just not answering.  She then waited 9 more minutes and then called his phone and local Hospital answered the phone and asked who she was, and she answered the questions, and she told her to get to the hospital.  She went to the hospital and the doctor came in and told her that he had the car running and he went to the gas pump to get gas and he stepped out of the car and collapsed.  The person who saw him told the attended that he had collapsed and they called 9-1-1 and he was pronounced dead.  He worked in a warehouse and was doing well and about to be certified to be a forklift driving.  They said that they worked on him and that they could not get his heart started again.   They had to do an autopsy which is against her religion and she will not find out those results for 3-6 months.  She said that he was healthy and looking forward to get tested at work.  They told her that he had an enlarged heart and an enlarged spleen, and had never had any heart issues in the past.    He walked 20,000 steps a day in the warehouse.    He was living in a sober man&#39;s facility, he has been clean for 18 months.  He had an addiction to pain pills and Xanax.    She feels that there was something in the vaccine that had something to do with it as he was perfectly healthy before the vaccine.

A 31-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17May2021 13:50 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0178) (at the age of 31 years old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no family history and no relevant tests. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient took the first dose of the COVID vaccine. About 25 minutes after, all of a sudden, his heartbeat increased really fast. He could not figure out what was going on. He had slight chest pain as well. It started out with him feeling uncomfortable in his chest. He told his wife that something was wrong. He was driving and had to pull over on the side of the road. The total episode lasted two to three minutes. He felt like he was going into cardiac arrest. His wife called 911. Within five minutes, they were there. They checked him out, and everything was normal. He thinks that normally his heart beats 70 to 80 beats per minute. His heart felt like it was beating 200 beats per minute. He felt his heart beating up to his neck. He felt like he could collapse. He clarifies that his heart was beating very fast for about 30 seconds. After that, his heart was still beating fast, but it started going down. Then after two minutes, it started going back to normal. His heart was still beating fast because he was still very anxious. He thinks the anxiety after ward was making his heart pump very fast. He was going to talk with his doctor next week to get checked out and find out if he has any underlying heart problems. He has never had any heart issues in the past. The outcome of events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I experienced two episodes of heart palpitations while at rest, not something I have experienced regularly before. During both events I was seated at rest, once at a desk, and once in a car driving. In both cases, my heart rate elevated unexpectedly to around 130&#43; BPM, and included a general feeling of heart beats being out of sync. The beat simply felt wrong or incorrect. The elevated heart rate lasted about 10 minutes, but anxiety and strange feeling of heart beat at closer to normal rate continued for 45 - 60 minutes. In both cases heart activity appeared to return to normal approximately an hour after onset. No shortness of breath, light headedness, dizziness, or other symptoms were experienced. In neither case was further medical attention sought. I would describe the frequency of the condition as mild, but the symptoms as moderate.

Discomfort when sleeping on sides due to increased perceived pressure on heart.  Acute chest pain (though still relatively mild) subsided after the first day, but minor discomfort persists after 10 days (as of reporting).

Around 6.5 hours after vaccination, while standing in my kitchen, I rapidly became very dizzy and fainted, falling to the kitchen floor. My girlfriend was there and said I hit my head on the floor, and was passed out for about 5 seconds before regaining consciousness and slowly coming back to myself. I reminded dizzy for another 20-30 minutes and had to stay laying down, before I was able to come to my feet and feel not dizzy anymore. I had plenty of food and water, so this event felt directly related to the vaccine.

Localized Soreness at vaccination site, extreme fatigue, fever, and chills. Then on Thursday morning, I had chest pain that i&#39;ve never experienced in my life. I went to a clinic where they ran an EKG report. There were off-signs that concluded I need to be sent to the hospital. An ambulance came and took me to hospital. I was met with a team of close to 12 doctors as they all checked for signs of heart attack. I stayed a total of 2 nights and 3 days in which several tests were conducted. EKG, Echogram, Angiogram, and an MRI. I was diagnosed with Myocarditis and Pericarditis. I have no history of smoking and I do not drink alcohol.

And then they gradually went away after about two weeks. I had no other symptoms related to my Covid vaccine including no fever, no chills, no body aches, no flu like symptoms.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

Within 5-10 minutes he slumped in his chair and became unresponsive. Became responsive to voice but was slurring his words. Patient was diaphoretic. HR in 90s, O2 98%. His eyes rolled back in his head  suspecting vasovagal episode, we moved patient to the floor  and raised his legs. He became more responsive. Was fully oriented although did not seem incredibly alert. Cycled multiple BPs with 100s-110s/60s-70s. HR 70s-80s  supine, O2 sat 96-98%.  EMS was called for transport to ED given patient&#39;s lack of prompt recovery. We  attempted to sit patient up and he again became lightheaded and had to lie back down. While in supine position, remained with normal and stable VS. At no time did he manifest any rash, respiratory symptoms, throat or chest tightness,  abdominal discomfort, or other overt signs of anaphylaxis.   Patient was transported to the ED where ROS was reported as:   - CONST: &#43;fatigue, denies fevers or chills  - EYES: Denies vision changes  - ENT: Denies rhinorrhea, sore throat  - CV: Denies new chest pain  - RESP: Denies SOB or cough  - GI: Denies abd pain, n/v, diarrhea  - GU: Denies dysuria  - MSK: Denies new joint swelling or pain  - SKIN: Denies new lesions or rash  - NEURO: Denies new HA, numbness, or weakness  - PSYCH: Denies suicidal ideation Vitals: BP 116/67, O2 99% on RA, Temp: 97.7F, Pulse 79.  ED provider felt this was most likely vasovagal episode given occurrence following vaccine administration and associated sxs. EKG without evidence of dysrrhythmia. No PE risk factors, SOB or CP. Pt with HA that was not thunderclap nor severe in nature and was consistent with prior migranes, thus do ot suspect SAH. No hx to suggest anemia and no anemia on blood work today. No report of  seizure. Pt is alert without report of post-ictal period.

                                                I developed atrial fibrillation which is ongoing several months later; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician.   A 32-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 at single dose via an unspecified route of administration  on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included colitis ulcerative. Concomitant medications included mesalamine. On 31Jan2021 developed atrial fibrillation which is ongoing several months later. Treatment received included  metoprolol, sotalol. At the time of the reporting the patient had not yet recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

He was in his usual state of health and doing well until he received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine around 0740 this morning.  Around 10 minutes following the vaccine, patient became short of breath, lightheaded and had his vision gray out before losing consciousness for few seconds.  Patient was sitting in a chair at that time and did not fall or hit his head.  He was then given juice and was able to ambulate and felt better.  Patient was directed to the emergency department for evaluation.  He states that he now feels back to his baseline with no lightheadedness or difficulty breathing.  Patient states that he has passed out following blood draws in the past and usually lies down afterward. Patient&#39;s presentation is overall most consistent with vasovagal syncope, especially given his history of similar events following blood draws.   Patient was observed in the emergency department for nearly an hour and remained asymptomatic so he was discharged home with return precautions

He regained consciousness almost immediately and he stated he was dizzy and lightheaded. He also stated he only ate one spinach salad during the day and is trying to lose weight. We gave him water and a protein bar to eat. He slowly sat up on the floor, sat in a chair, and then stood. His fiance came to pick him up and drive him home. When called on 4/9, he stated that he was doing well and having no adverse reactions.

Pt was tapped, and verbally asked if he could hear us. Initially there was no response. Checked for breathing, then begin checking for pulse, but he came to. He started speaking with us, saying he was feeling light headed, and got up to notify us, but then he couldn&#39;t remember the rest. Asked if he had a history of seizures or diabetes and he said no to either. At some point he went out again, briefly. Meanwhile, the tech called 911. He came to again, begin talking with us. At some point he requested water, which we got. After seeping, he wanted to sit up. We asked him to place his back against the wall, if he wanted to. He did so, and after a few seconds said he wanted to lay down again. EMS came. They asked if he wanted to go to the ER which he consented to. They rolled him out on a stretcher.

About 10 minutes after his vaccination, patient fell off his chair to the ground and had a syncopal event. He appeared to lose consciousness for a few seconds and then became alert. He had a slightly bloody nose, which we cleaned up. We laid him down on the floor and monitored his blood pressure while applying a cool compress to his forehead and neck.  He was doing fine, so we continued to monitor him for another hour. He mentioned he had not eaten since the night before at 5pm. We gave him a protein bar and some juice and water( after about 1/2 hour) and he felt much better.   We advised him to contact his doctor if he did not feel better later today. Patient received a ride home.

                                                I had one large cup of coffee with cream and 3 doughnuts for breakfast approximately 3 hours before the vaccine. I took one Claritin Readitab approximately 2 hours before my vaccine injection to help with pollen allergies.   I was seated during the vaccine injection.  The injection was delivered into upper left arm. I felt fine at first. I stood and exited the room and began speaking with the pharmacist that had delivered the invention to receive instructions. Approximately 2-5 minutes after I received the injection I began to feel dizzy. After approximately 1 minute of dizziness I sat down.  I began to get extremely dizzy to the point of faintness. I noticed during this time that I was getting very sweaty. My skin over my whole body seemed to me to be damp from sweat and where I checked I was sweating visibly (no droplets formed? it was just dampness). At the same time I experienced nausea. I believed that I might throw up, so I requested something to throw up into. I never threw up. I continued to get more and more dizzy and I had trouble remaining upright (while seated). A woman observing me stated afterward that my eyes rolled back and that I fainted. I do not believe that I actually fainted because I remember hearing her tell the pharmacist that I had passed out. I had my eyes closed though, so it is possible that I fainted briefly.  The pharmacist called 911. I began to feel better approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I stopped sweating, and then the nausea subsided, and then my dizziness cleared up.   The EMTs arrived approximately 20 minutes after I received the vaccine and took my blood pressure. I do not remember the reading, but the EMT stated that it was not elevated. My blood oxygen was 99%. The EMT waited about 10 minutes and took my blood pressure again. He stated that it was higher, but not concerning. The EMT waited another 10-15 minutes and then left. Before he left, the EMT stated to me that I was one of 2 concurrent calls regarding adverse vaccine responses.   After this event I drank a bottle of  water. It did not seem to have an impact.   I have not received vaccinations since I was a child. I do not remember adverse reactions to injections when I was a child. I did pass out when giving blood approximately 12 years ago. I have always attributed this to the fact that I did not eat or drink for 20 hours prior to donating blood.

                                                I felt very lightheaded and woozy roughly 5 minutes after injection. I was found passed out on the bathroom floor shortly after, with no recollection of entering the bathroom. It was estimated I was out for a couple minutes. I personally wondered if it caused blood pressure to drop, but I had no way to test it and was more focused on sitting up at the time. I stayed in the waiting area until I was confident I was able to walk on my own. A second wave, though less intense, happened roughly 30-45 minutes after the first. I left the store after 2 hours with fatigue, arm pain, and the hand of the opposite arm shaking on its own. The hand stopped shaking roughly 3 hours after the injection.  Fatigue was mostly gone in a day. I could not raise my arm above chest height without pain the 1st day. Today is day two and I can raise it up properly again with mild stiffness and slight twinges of pain.

                                                The patient began to vomit within 10 minutes of receiving his vaccine . He was also having numbness in his left hand.  I sat with the patient in the consultation room for 20 minutes, until he became more calm. I offered him some water and I took his blood pressure every 5 minutes.  It was initially 154/105 and eventually decreased to 140/90. His heart rate was normal and he had no shortness of breath or signs of any rash. He threw up twice.  I offered to call ems for him if he wanted  but he declined. Once his blood pressure decreased he said that he felt better and sat in the pharmacy waiting area until he felt completely better. I called him 30 minutes after his departure from the pharmacy to make sure he got home safe and he was thankful for the call. I did advise him to contact his PCP if the numbness in his hand worsens or does not get better. I also told him to seek medical help if he gets any shortness of breath, rash or other unusual symptoms.

It sharp pain comes and goes very often throughout the morning and day.  I would describe the pain as a mini heart attack even though I never experienced a heart attack.    Today, the sharp pain around my chest area isn?t as strong as before but I do not feel 100 percent.  There is a feeling in my chest area that I can?t shake out.  It could be all psychological but who knows.

                                                I received the COVID-19 vaccine at 9:30 am from vaccination clinic. I had just recovered from COVID-19 about two and a half weeks prior. I had no immediate reaction. I worked the entire day with no adverse effects other than a sore arm, which I expected. Later in the day at about 7:45 pm I went for a 6 mile run and got home at approximately 8:49 pm. Within half an hour of getting home, I quickly became feverish. The fever continued to rise until I was extremely hot, and hotter than I can ever remember as an adult or child. I did not have access to a thermometer so I cannot reliably report what the temperature was but I am estimating 103. It felt like every part of my body, including my legs, was hot to the touch. By 1 am I had serious chills and was shivering under winter blankets despite an outdoor temperature of 70-80. In addition, I had an extremely elevated heart rate and chest pain. I also had generalized muscle aches all over my body.  I did not sleep at all that night. The fever began to slowly dissipate early in the morning but the elevated heart rate continued for approximately 24 hours. The discomfort resulting from my elevated heart rate was substantial and alarming enough that I sought advice from my primary care physician after a nurse at my Occupational Health clinic suggested potentially getting an ECG. Ultimately, by Thursday morning, the symptoms had decreased and I declined any follow up. However, this was the single worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to any vaccine and the single worst fever I&#39;ve ever experienced as an adult or in my memory as a child. Although I am aware that people who have already had COVID-19 tend to have worse reactions to the first COVID vaccine, I am filing this report primarily because of my concern that exercise may trigger an especially severe reaction.

He got lightheaded and passed out as he was bending over. The patient hit his head and briefly passed out. We got him to the ground slowly and provided him with an ice pack and bottle of water. He was breathing quickly and shallowly for about 30 seconds but returned to normal shortly after.

                                                In the morning of May 2nd I was driving and I felt my heart rate increasing lasted about 30 minutes to an hour. I ended up going to the ER and I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia, I stayed overnight. After that event I developed a cognitive fog and a sensation of numbness on the left side of my head like someone is pulling the skin on my face ever so slightly. I also developed a sense of imbalance like I am in a boat for an extended period of time. These feelings remained constant and I noticed that they were getting better by May 19th. At 6 am on May 19th I walk up to the feeling of my heart pounding and my heart rate increasing, I measured my pulse on my watch and it was around 150 bpm average. This event lasted about 5 minutes and went away. On May 19th around 10 pm I was in the shower and my heart rate increase again and I felt a tickling sensation on the left side of my chest when I was breathing in. I ended up going to the ER gain and stayed overnight. May 26th I felt the sensations of fogginess and just feeling off cognitively. May 27th I woke up rested without fogginess and after a morning walk with my dog I felt my heart increasing. This episode lasted about 10-20 minutes and my heart rate was ranging between 120-150 bpm. My stools from April 20th till May 26th have been lighter in color yellowish and soft, when I consumed vegetables I could see specs of them in my stools like they were not fully processed. May 27th was the first day where my stool color was brown but still soft.

I continued to feel like I was unable to perform at peak athletic performance. The second shot caused whole-body inflammation and another week of malaise and a cloudy mind. After one month I am still &#39;off&#39; and have had several episodes of nearly passing out with prolonged dizziness and fatigue, and am concerned about a heart complication from vaccination.

                                                Patient was tense and nervous to get his COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) after seeing another patient feeling light-headed after his respective vaccine. The patient was pacing back and forth deciding if he should get his vaccine or come back another day. He decided to get vaccinated. Immediately after the vaccine was administered the patient, while still sitting down,  passed out and leaned forward falling on the floor. As the intern reached down to help the patient he came to and was able to get back on the chair on his own. At that point the PIC and the intern remained with the patient for observation and provided water. The patient remained under observation for about half an hour and expressed he felt well enough to go home.

                                                In the weeks after 2nd vaccine dose, experienced chest tightness/pain in heart area. At the time I thought this was due to recent weight gain and lack of good sleep, however now I believe it is related to the heart inflammation symptoms reported in the media by outlets such as Reuters. The tightness/pain was intermittent meaning it did not occur all the time, but I would feel it for some part of the day and it would recur. This lasted for about a month and seems to have gotten better. However, I am about to schedule an appointment with a cardiologist in order to get this looked at as I am worried of what other unknown side effects will be in time.

                                                After receiving the vaccine the patient was instructed to sit at the designated post vaccination area. As he was sitting in the chair, a few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient lost consciousness and fell from the chair onto the floor. The patient was unresponsive for a few seconds. When I positioned him in an upward position he regained consciousness and did not remember what happened. The patient had a fast heart rate and was feeling hot, dizzy, and nauseated. He showed no signs of anaphylactic/allergic reaction. Patient admitted he was nervous and anxious about the vaccine and does not like needles. I instructed the patient to remain seated on the floor and gave him an ice pack, water, and told him to take deep breathes. Patient stated he felt better. The store manager and I called 911 to get paramedics to check his vitals. Patient denied to go to emergency room, said he was feeling better. Patient confirmed he lived only a few blocks away and he had someone to drive him. Paramedics cleared the patient and stated all vitals were in normal range. Patient stayed at the pharmacy for 10 more minutes after that with instructions if he felt any symptoms to call his doctor or 911.

My sister also was diagnosed around the same time and we took the same vaccine around the same time.  Diverticulitis lasted for 7 days and recently re-inflammed and I may have to go to urgent care again for antibiotics.

I went to the ER and was hospitalized for 24 hours. At the hospital I received multiple tests but it was not discovered was caused my symptoms. Later my Primary Care provider diagnosed me with a B12 deficiency based on the same test results, and treatment with cobalamin injections has been very effective.

                                                Myocarditis documented by MRI; Concomitant diagnosis of Type A inflo; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 32-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration date was not reported), intramuscular on the right arm on 11Mar2021 (15:45) as a 2nd dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hereditary haemochromatosis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took erythromycin and cefaclor (CECLOR), and had allergies with these medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient had previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL9264; Expiration date was not reported) on 17Feb2021 (13:00) (when the patient was 32 years old) intramuscular on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. On 08Jun2021, the patient had myocarditis documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a concomitant diagnosis of &#34;type A inflo&#34;. The events had resulted into a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was hospitalized for six days (in Jun2021) due to the reported events, and had received cardvedilol, sacubitril, valsartan (ENTRESTO) and &#34;life vest. diurectics&#34; as treatment for the reported events. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient had no COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s COVID-19 nasal swab on 08Jun2021 was negative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and plausible temporal association, the causality between BNT162B2 and the event myocarditis cannot be excluded. Event influenza based on the known drug safety profile is assessed as unrelated to  BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit-risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, ethics committees. and investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The weekend following my injection I started feeling weird palpitations in my chest, some soft fluttering, some hard beats. After doing a bit of research I chalked it up to potentially being gas but as it persisted and got worse at times I decided to go to the ER. The ER confirmed heart PVCs via EKG and conducted Xrays of my chest and did blood labs. I was told everything was fine and was discharged and told to follow up with my primary care physician. After following up with my primary provider she informed me to continue monitoring.

The next couple of days he continued to doing normal workouts and played basketball, he was never warned by health professionals not to. Within a week of getting the first shot, he would do normal cardio workouts that he had been doing prior to getting the shot, but during the workouts he noticed his heart having almost painful palpitations that he had never noticed before. Now even the slightest increase in his heart rate results in palpitations during normal activity and he has to stop all activity until the palpitations stop.

A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0180), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Jun2021 12:15 (at the age of 32-year-old), as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in pharmacy. The patient had no medical history present and no family medical history relevant to AE. The patient had no other products taken. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. After received the first dose around 16:30 on 16Jun2021, the patient waited there 15 minutes after and was fine. Four hours later, the patient blacked out and fell to the floor. The patient stated he was unconscious for 30 seconds and then snapped back to life, drenched in sweat, started to lose balance, couldn&#39;t stand, and couldn&#39;t walk. The patient stated he did not have a phobia of getting a needle or anything like that. The patient stated he was not doing anything but eating dinner when it happened. For a minute or two while all this was happening, he states he lost his hearing. Then the patient was able to walk about 25 feet and tried to lean against the wall and then fell to the floor. Patient stated his buddy was there and tried to wake him up. The patient was still thinking in his mind but he didn&#39;t know where he was. He had complete loss of body function for about 20 minutes. The patient stated he was then able to lay down, drenched from sweat from head to toe, the cold air outside seemed to help, He stated his neck was burning, like it was on fire. The patient said that  everything came out of left field. He seemed fine from 00:15 until 16:30 (on 16Jun2021). He felt zapped from energy, so he went to sleep from 16:45 until 23:00, which he seemed to help. The patient stated he has had nothing like that today, he was just weak and could not lift his arm. His face did get very, very pale when these events happened. He stated everything happened yesterday between 16:15 to16:45. The patient states for 20 minutes he had to lay down and get fresh air and during that time there was a moment he couldn&#39;t hear, he thought he had lost his hearing. Patient stated it was very scary and he considers himself a healthy male and tried to do all the right things. He states he did not have a fear of getting the vaccine, then everything hit him really hard. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: excellent. Outcome of the all events was resolved on 16Jun2021while outcome of the event zapped of energy was resolving and  weak and could not lift my arm up was unknown.

My PCP also advised to get the 2nd dose.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

                                                On 26DEC ( 5 days after first injection), he started experiencing pain and weakness in the  Right deltoid radiating down to the fingertips . Within a week, started feeling similar symptoms in Left extremity. No shoulder/neck pain. Pain starts at the deltoid at the injection site and has caused stiffness, pain, and tightness of the upper extremities alone. Decreased grip b/l. Symptoms have persisted since ( almost a month now) but did seem to resolve while on prednisone, but returned after cessation.   No respiratory issues, chest pain, paresthesias, or lower extremity symptoms.

                                                Patient presented for his first vaccine dose. He later stated he felt a sensation of something moving through his arm after vaccine administered, then states he felt some increased anxiety, followed by cold sweats, and then lost consciousness.  He was noted to be unresponsive, initially with brief period of apnea, and was unresponsive to sternal rub by vaccine administration staff.  He was placed into a reclined position in the driver seat of his vehicle. He regained consciousness within a minute, and was normally responsive but with pale color noted to face and chest, diaphoresis, and thready pulse with bradycardia, HR 43.  Difficult to auscultate HR and breath sounds clear but shallow. EMS responded promptly and assisted with evaluation, with initial BP 80/50, SpO2 97%.  Patient became less responsive and started to lose consciousness again, but responded to questioning, then lost consciousness again. His feet were placed on the dashboard to elevate them, and he quickly regained consciousness, pulse improved to HR 86, and repeat BP after a few minutes was 140/76. Oxygen saturations briefly dipped to 90% then rebounded to 100%. He improved quickly, was normally responsive and able to drink orange juice. He had pale clammy skin on the face, neck and hands, and some facial flushing.  Patient was monitored for several minutes, had improvement in symptoms, and refused transport by stretcher to the ambulance. He was able to walk to the passenger side of his vehicle and was driven out of the vaccination facility and further monitored. Blood glucose noted to be 96, EKG normal with sinus rhythm, no acute ST or T wave changes or other acute abnormality.   Patient was offered transport to the hospital for further evaluation, but he declined. Symptoms resolved completely, he was monitored for resolution of symptoms. He reported prior similar symptoms after a hand laceration at work and after a dental visit. Risks discussed, prevention measures for second dose discussed. Encouraged follow up with PCP given recurrent vasovagal syncope. No signs of allergy noted.

                                                Began to develop a slight brain fog one hour upon dose administration. Otherwise mild. Went to bed at 11:00 pm and woke up at 2 am with heart thumping with pulse beating around 70 beats per minute. Became highly attuned to it and experienced tacychardia at 118 (generally resting heart rate is extremely low). Seemed to return to 70 with some breathing exercises and returned to sleep. Woke up the next morning with flu symptoms and the works - felt worse than original Covid in October. Flu like symptoms seemed to pass by Monday. However, pulse remained elevated through the week by about ten points and noticed hypertension. BP 150/95 Wednesday and 160/100 on Friday. Went to ER Friday night with BP 188/117 and tachycardia. Vitals and blood work all normal however confusion as to why BP remains elevated despite Thursday before vaccine being 132/82. Left hospital with BP 154/95. Palpatations and thumping chest have continued throughout the week. As well as general fatigue and fog behind the eyes.

We gave him an ice pack and monitored him for 30 minutes after. His blood pressure was 90/60 a few minutes after the episode but then it came up to 124/84 a few minutes later. His eyes were dilated and we were concerned about a possible concussion from the fall so EMS came and evaluated him. They cleared him to go home.

                                                I received my first dose of the pfizer vaccine at 11am at the safeway pharmacy. I had consumed several glasses of water in the morning before the event, a cup of yerba mate tea, and a piece of toast. I smoke, and had smoked one cigarette in the morning before my appointment. Just after receiving the vaccine I ate a few pieces of jerky and maybe 15 Jojo potatoes from the safeway deli.  I was advised to wait 15 minutes before leaving. I set an alarm. I bought some food to eat (jojo potatoes and jerky) and waited to leave the site until 11:22am. I felt strange/weird, but this isn&#39;t an unusual feeling after receiving any kind of shot/vaccine for me.   I was driving to work and I started to feel just a little bit strange after smoking another cigarette. I got a little nauseous but nothing too bad. Thirty seconds later I started to get dizzy, my ears rang, I felt my blood pressure drop, and I passed out on the interstate going freeway speeds. I woke up around a minute and half later according to my brother who was on the phone. I was treated for injuries at emergency room.

I was alone at the time so I dont know if hitting my head on the floor or the fainting caused loss of consicousness. I was out for 20 min to 1 hour. Lost 4-8 oz of blood from bloody nose caused by hitting my head on the floor.

Within 24 hours severe shortness of breath and severe chest pains. Went to 2 urgent cares. Was prescribed Prednisone and a Inhaler. Both did nothing. Symptoms got worse. went to my primary doctor who ordered a chest X ray which came back good. and a EKG which came back with a slight issue and referred me to a cardiologist next month. Was sent home to recover. Pain and shortness of breath got worse. Within a week after that i got severe headaches and the left side of my head arm and leg began to get numb and tingle sensation  which lasted about 48 hours. About 2 weeks after vaccine i began to improve. Chest pain started to go away and my shortness of breath as well. As of today 4-18-2021 no chest pain, and shortness of breath still comes and goes but nothing compared to weeks before.

The patient experienced vomiting blood in Apr2021, blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up / spitting up blood in Apr2021, he feels like his throat is so raw on 05Apr2021, sore arm on 05Apr2021, feeling achy/ her husband is still sore/achy today on 05Apr2021, nauseous on 05Apr2021, vomiting/ throwing up on 05Apr2021, diarrhea on 05Apr2021, chilly in Apr2021, redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids; his pores looked red in Apr2021, fatigue on 05Apr2021. No treatment received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events pain in arm, ache, nauseous, erythema, fatigue was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Clinical course as reported: Her husband got their second dose of the vaccine on 05Apr2021. Her husband was having a more severe reaction than the first time. The first time he got the vaccine his arm was sore. Last night (05Apr2021), the caller&#39;s husband was vomiting just over and over and had diarrhea, both at the same time. Wife added the thing she was worried about was that her husband was vomiting blood as well, and that her husband said it was from the phlegm, like he felt like his throat was so raw. Her husband did not really want to eat anything which she expected was normal. She was trying to give him fluids, and having him drink a little bit. Her husband had not vomited since around 4 am. And right now, he was sleeping. She did not know if she should give him medicine or take him to be seen or if this was a normal reaction to the vaccination. She did read side effects from the paper and she saw that some vomiting was expected but the blood was what caught her off guard. Around 10 o&#39;clock last night (05Apr2021), her husband felt nauseous and went to bed. She actually fell asleep on the couch and heard her husband vomiting across the house, that was how bad the vomiting was. The vomiting started at midnight last night (05Apr2021). Her husband has been vomiting every couple of hours (2 hours), around the clock. Diarrhea had been at the same time. From her understanding, her husband had vomited at least 3 or 4 times, and had diarrhea 3 or 4 times. She kind of lost track after the 3rd time, but she had not heard him since around 4 am Her husband was still sore/achy today (06Apr2020) and was is still nauseous. She believed he was also feeling chilly. He was wrapped up in his blanket. Her husband did not have a fever, she has been checking his temperature. Wife stated no treatment yet, as she did not know what was safe. Her husband wanted to wait until he stopped vomiting because anything he put in his stomach came right back up. After the first time her husband was done throwing up, and was only dry heaving, he started to like kind of spit. When he would gargle or spit, there was blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up. The first time the wife went to check on him, she saw him spitting up blood. It was not like his vomit was red with blood in it, it was just the after effects, so she thought she should call and report this. Each time he has vomited, there was still that spit up of blood afterwards. The patient himself clarified the vomiting was last around 4 am (06Apr2020), give or take, and the last stool/bout of diarrhea was around 7 am (06Apr2020). He was still feeling nauseous and fatigued. He added that after the first time he vomited and the couple times he checked later on, he looked in the mirror and saw that there was this redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids. He adds it was red, it wasn&#39;t like splotchy, but it was like his pores looked red, like pinpoints. The patient clarified that the fatigue and achiness probably started around the first time he vomited, and that was still hanging around. The wife stated this was better than him getting Covid. Wife added what she was trying to see was if she should take her husband to the hospital or not. She did not want to wait too long, but if this was something that was a side effect that was expected, then her husband could just sleep it off.

                                                The patient began feeling light-headed and diaphoretic immediately after vaccine administration.

                                                Around 5:00 pm the day after the shot, I began experiencing some sharp aches/pains in my upper chest and lower abdomen, both on my left-side. Breathing was a little more difficult due to these pains. The symptoms have persisted since that time, although they have been more subdued. Experienced a peak again around noon on 4/30/2021, but is milder again as I submit this.

A 33-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Mar2021 at 11:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received the vaccination in the pharmacy. There was no medical history or concomitant medications. There were no other vaccines administered in the last four weeks. On 25Mar2021 at 23:30, the patient experienced passed out, felt strange/weird, nauseous, dizzy, ears rang, and blood pressure drop. The clinical course was as follows: the patient was advised to wait 15 minutes before leaving. He set an alarm. He bought some food to eat (potatoes and jerky) and waited to leave the site until 11:22. He felt strange/weird, but this was not an unusual feeling after receiving any kind of shot/vaccine for the patient. He was driving to work and started to get a little nauseous but nothing too bad. Thirty seconds later, he started to get dizzy, ears rang, felt blood pressure drop, and passed out going freeway speeds. He was treated in the emergency department and released the same day. There was no treatment given in response to the events. There was no covid prior to or post vaccination. The clinical outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I also had occasional slight headaches during the day on 5/1. After the fever symptoms went away, the were immediately replaced by: runny nose, sneezing, some coughing, a slight wheeze (only lasted from 3 AM to 4 AM), slight chest tightness, itchy mouth/tongue, and throat tightness. All of those lasted until around 11 AM on 5/2. Only a slight throat tightness remains now (noon on 5/2).

EKG, blood work, and chest x-rays were taken.  All came back clear.  Blood pressure was 162/96.  Chest pain was deemed to be musculoskelatal.  Took blood pressure readings 2 days later and it was 155/90.  Took regular readings over the following 3 days and it averaged 150/85.  Blood pressure remains high and general practitioner will try low dose blood pressure medications.

It evolved into a fairly intense headache for which he took some ibuprofen.  He had chills and fevers and felt very poorly.  At 7 AM on Saturday, April 24 he suffered excruciating substernal chest pain.  It was a burning sensation and it was so severe he wanted to die to relieve the pain. The pain was only minimally positional and it was nonpleuritic. He drove himself to the nearest hospital and even drove through some red lights to get there more quickly.  When he arrived he had ST elevation in the same leads with his early repolarization which was perhaps a millimeter or so higher than the EKG we did in February.  He had both an elevation of his troponin levels which were 5.07, 6.06, 5.72 and 5.73.  A CK was 195 with an MB of 41.2.  He was taken to the cath lab emergently.  no coronary disease.

While on the way home, I developed rash on my both arms and felt dizzy. I pulled over to a parking lot but before I could park my car, I passed out. I couldn&#39;t control my car and I bumped into another parked car. All this happened in a matter of 15 seconds. My wife and my daughter was with me. When I regained consciousness, my wife was doing CPR on. A bystander in the parking lot called EMS for me.

                                                Patient post-vaccination (Pfizer/0.3ml/1st dose administered @10:23a) appeared to be seizing in his chair during observation @ 10:26a.  I rushed to him, requesting aid from his colleagues to help lay him on the ground and elevate his feet. He was unresponsive and disoriented, with shallow breathing and weak pulse, so I activated EMS @ 10:26a.  He appeared to seize again so I instructed two men to help roll him onto his side, at which time, an RN managing the vaccines, took over monitoring while I talked to 911.  EMS was on scene @ 10:29a. RN reports he&#39;d had a vagal response, most likely due to witnessed severe anxiety during IM injection (name /right deltoid @ 10:23a). RN gave him Gatorade and he quickly became AOx3.  When EMS arrived, he was able to stand up, with assist, and be placed on the gurney.  EMS monitored him for ~ 20min onsite, at which time he became hypotensive, resulting in transport to the nearest ER with O2 and IV management.  Per HR representative for a business patient was discharged @ ~2p the same day, with diagnosis of severe dehydration and hypokalemia, his reaction most likely a vagal event.  Unknown if medications were given outpatient.

A 33-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 08May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8731) as 2nd dose, single for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 on 17Apr2021 (Batch/lot number: EW0162) for covid-19 immunisation. On 08May2021, the patient walked to observation area and sat down. After about five minutes, the patient became pale and lost consciousness. The patient fell from seated position onto concrete ground and hit head causing a two-inch laceration behind ear. Ambulance was called and evaluated patient. The patient refuse to sign with AMR. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported loss consciousness which subsequently led to a fall resulting in a two-inch laceration behind ear and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Took Losatran and baby aspirin the morning of (5/22/2021). Treated at urgent care and provided provided three chewable baby aspirin and amLODIPime.

He received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine from my intern without incident. He proceed to the waiting room to wait the 30 minutes that was recommended.  After about 5 min. passed, his girlfriend alerted us that he was feeling faint.  I went to check on him and after talking with him for a few minutes, his head rolled back and he lost consciousness for approx 5-10 seconds.  I went into the pharmacy to dial 911. When I got back to him, he was already back awake.  Fire dept was dispatched and they checked his vitals and he signed a form to go AMA to the hospital.

                                                Approximately 2 weeks after the 2nd dose of the pheizer vaccine,  I started experiencing vertigo,  and a massive lack of energy.  Sometimes it gets so bad,  I have to sit down because it feels like I&#39;m going to collapse.  I have also experienced chest pains in the first month after the second shot,  but these have seemed to go away.  The tired and vertigo sensations are ongoing months after the shot.

                                                Patient appeared anxious when he came in to get vaccinated. He complained of not really wanting  to get the vaccine, but was compelled by his employer. About 15 minutes after vaccination, he started sweating profusely, complained of dehydration, looked pale and asked to lay down. Ice pack was given to the patient and 911 was called.  EMT checked his blood glucose and was found to be hypoglycemic. He was later transported to the ER by the EMT.

A 33-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 11May2021 10:15 (at 33-year-old) (Lot Number: EW0182) as 2nd dose, single in arm right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety, depression, and panic. No known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Apr2021 15:30 (at 33-year-old) (Lot Number: EW0171) as 1st dose, single in arm right for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient wasn&#39;t diagnosed with COVID-19. After about 7-10 days after 2nd dose vaccination he became very dizzy and fatigued, and had extreme brain fog and light headedness. There where times where he felt he was going to pass out. He also had shortness of breath, tightness in throat and dry mouth. He also developed a very strong metal taste in his mouth that lasted for a few weeks. Sometimes he would also get strange sensations or weakness in his muscles with sweats or hot flashes. Some days he would wake up feeling like he was intoxicated like a drunk feeling. The feelings also came with extreme anexity and panic although the symptoms themselves could have caused that. The onset date of events was reported as 14May2021 02:30 am. No treatment received for events. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was resolving.

                                                My reactions to the second shot started with a sore arm, night sweating for the first day of injection (5/9). In the morning of the two days after the shot, there are also some minor nose bleedings. The primary reason I&#39;m reporting is because of the symptoms below:  On 5/10, I suffered from fatigue that I had to sleep every other couple of hours. In the night the adverse event that resembled myocarditis occurred when I went to bed (around 10 PM). The symptoms included respiratory difficulties/shortness of breath and severe chest pain especially when lying on my back, and pains in the upper body mostly in both arms. As a result, I wasn&#39;t able to sleep until 4 AM when these symptoms started to reduce. However the fatigue and periodic shortness of breath persisted for a couple of more days.   I recognized these symptoms are much like the ones I experienced once in 2018, although I was able to get a diagnosis of myocarditis after being tested with ECG and blood tests. During that event the trajectory of serverless and recovery was similar.

Then I went to the rheumatologist and I was studied because I tested positive for an AMA. They didn&#39;t find anything further so I am back to seeing my PCD for the fatigue and anemia. I don&#39;t remember when I saw those DRs but it was post vaccination some time.

The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot no: EW0177) on 17May2021 (at age of 33 years old) at left arm as single dose for COVID-19 Immunization and experienced a lot of congestion, body aches, cough. Caller stated he had side effects to the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine and went to the ER (emergency room).

On the 16Jun2021, he couldn&#39;t stand up anymore so he went to the emergency room. He couldn&#39;t stand up anymore so he had to go to the emergency room on 16Jun2021. He was discharged from the emergency room. The emergency room ran some tests and told him to take some Tylenol. He had a COVID 19 test and he is expecting a call with the results and the staff at the hospital took his temperature. He explained to the hospital staff that he was having the symptoms that are on the COVID 19 vaccine paperwork and that was the reason for his visit, since he had the two COVID 19 vaccines. He would like to point out that he asked the nurse when he was going to have the second dose, since the first vaccine he was still having side effects, he asked her if he was in danger to have the second vaccine. The nurse told him he was ok to get the second vaccine. The nurse told him he might have some muscle pain but he shouldn&#39;t be worried about it. At the emergency room he also had some blood tests. And also they took his pulse and after that the doctor was reading something in English that the interpreter couldn&#39;t catch and read. He provided Pfizer with what happened so far since he had the vaccine. He wasn&#39;t able to stand up with the muscle pain and he couldn&#39;t support his legs any longer, all on 16Jun2021. He would like to know if he&#39;s going to get some help with the medical bills. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Blood test: negative, COVID-19 virus test: negative on 16Jun2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He was not falling over but had to be very careful with his steps.; burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back; he felt off. It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux. He experienced some unusual side effects that were not listed on the web. His boss advised him to call. Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.   Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

A 34-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, Lot number EL0140, in Hospital, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 22Dec2020 (at 34 years of age) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prediabetes (glucose tolerance impaired) from an unknown date. The patient didn&#39;t have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included metformin and multivitamins. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced premature ventricular contractions, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, shortness of breath and chest pain. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care access and hospitalization as life threatening events. The patient was treated with diltiazem, fludrocortisone, aspirin and atorvastatin. He remained in hospital 2 days and then he was discharged. The patient underwent COVID-19 test (nasal swab) on 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 and both gave negative results. The patient had not recovered yet from the reported events at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events ventricular extrasystoles, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, dyspnea and chest pain cannot be excluded as the information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. The patient is a young adult with known prediabetes, but no other comorbidities reported. Information on tests done during admission, clinical course and working diagnosis would be helpful in further assessment of this case. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Pt received his vaccine and immediately slumped over and vasovagaled. Pt came to and told me he vasovagaled and that this has happened before, however usually it was when people take things out out of his body like when they draw blood. Pt states that he gets flushed, diaphoretic when this happens. He denies respiratory distress and pruritis. Pt was given juice and crackers. Shortly after, pt experienced another vasovagal episode. He became pale, diaphoretic, and vasovagaled.   Pt was brought on to a cot. He was given an ice pack. He stayed laying down for 15 minutes. Eventually pt was brought to sitting up position. He left and was comfortable to drive. A note was added into his chart for his second vaccine.

On 03/28/2021, I began to notice chest pain and simultaneous pain in my left arm on 03/28/2021. The fever, chills, headache, and general soreness subsided on 03/29/2021, but the periodic chest and arm pain persisted and continued to get worse. On 03/29/2021 I also had nausea/vomiting and sweating. On the morning of 03/30/2021 during an episode of chest and arm pain we went to the Emergency Department at. At the emergency department, they detected elevated troponin levels indicating damage to the heart muscle. I was rushed via ambulance for an emergency heart catheterization. I was admitted to the hospital and monitored while various other tests were performed. It was determined that there was inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis).

                                                The patient developed a sensation of seeing bright sparkly spots in his vision that lasted a brief moment.  He said that this typically happens after he gets a shot or is exposed to needles.  He then asked if he could lay himself down because he says that is what usually helps him feel better.  His SBP was measured to be in the 80s initially with a heart rate in the low 50s.  His oxygen saturation was normal.  He was given some water to drink.   After a few minutes, his heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal.  We discussed having him go to the hospital.  After our evaluation, the patient preferred to go home.  We asked that he go to the hospital if his symptoms returned.

                                                April 7, woke up with a headache, took ibuprofen. A few hours later, started feeling hazy, lightheaded and had trouble concentrating while working from home. Felt like I was going to pass out. Took a break from computer screen, symptoms appeared to subside.  An hour later, same haziness feeling came back. Thought I was going to pass out again. Called 911. ER diagnosed  me with near syncope. Told me to keep an eye on symptoms and come back if things worsen. I informed them I had received one dose of vaccine, they didn?t seem to think it was related.  Symptoms have slightly improved since, but still have bouts of dizziness four days later.

Bleeding stopped for approx. 5 mins and started a second time. Second bleed lasted approx. 6-10mins and was a medium to heavy flow (4-5 napkins). When I was able to wash out the blood a large blood slime was pulled out from my nose. All bleeding was from the right nostril.  No bleeding has occurred since (approx. 15hrs later).

                                                Within an hour of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel &#34;odd&#34; (i.e heart racing, spine tingling, strange sensations in my hands, and dizziness).  At the hour mark, while trying to &#34;walk it off&#34; inside my backyard, things escalated quickly.  As I came back inside, I suddenly collapsed and and lost consciousness.  Luckily my best friend was with me and she described my behavior as a full on seizure (which I am not predisposed to).  According to her, I was flopping around, spitting wildly and drooling all over my face, my eyes wide and glazed staring into nothing, lips turning blue.  She immediately called 911 and within 5-10 minutes, two EMT&#39;s arrived and began to speak to me and take my vitals.  For a good 15 minutes I couldn&#39;t sit up and had to lay on the ground, still extremely out of it - unable to think, merely in extreme discomfort similar to the most intense flu I&#39;ve ever experienced.  After a half hour or so, I sat up and was able to thank them for helping me and answer some of their questions.  Over another 15 or so minutes they said all my vitals were perfect and they were not worried about me - sure I&#39;d make a full recovery, which I hope I did.  I am feeling MUCH better today.  The reason I felt it so important to submit this report is because I had never heard of anyone experiencing side-effects that severe.  Of course I had heard it could wipe you out, give you chills, aches, and exhaustion - but I had never heard that it could lead to a seizure so scary that my best friend thought I might be dying.  I truly don&#39;t know what might have happened without her.  People should know to have someone at home with them after the second dose.  I am not over-exaggerating about my symptoms whatsoever.  My body still hurts all over and I feel as if I went through some type of gauntlet yesterday.  I absolutely do NOT want to discourage anyone from getting the vaccine, but I wish I had some notion that something so severe could happen to me.

Upon arrival to the scene, patient was talking &#34;saying i&#39;m fine). I helped patient to sit up and eventually helped him to sit in a chair. Patient said he could taste the vaccine while receiving the shot and he told the immunizing technician about it. Patient left after 20 minutes without any treatment.

Initial: Itching and burning through my neck and shoulders, and swollen lymph nodes in neck and collarbone. I began sweating at night profusely and losing weight. I have had a lot of trouble sleeping. These symptoms continued in 24-48 hour cycles of flare ups until 04/19/2021 but finally seem to be abating. Progression: secondary symptoms appeared over the course of the month such as full body joint soreness, weakness, stiffness, stabbing pains (in the neck, arms, chest, and abdomen), blood pressure spikes, dry/sore throat, dry eyes, difficulty swallowing. Symptoms are similar to arthritis or other autoimmune diseases. Night sweats continue but are lighter. Weight loss continues but slower. Sleeping remains irregular.

Other symptoms: lightheadedness and fatigue continuing from 1 day after vaccination. Chest pain continued; going to a clinic was advised by multiple sources. At 9:00 AM, went to a clinic and got a CKG. The CKG was normal. I concluded that the problem was chest wall inflammation, and took ibuprofen. With ibuprofen, the chest pain was mostly gone by 8:00 PM.

                                                As a clinical monitor, I was called over to assess a driver slumped over in his seat. He had just received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine approximately 10 minutes earlier. The passenger (his fiance) said he was acting normal until she heard him grunt and then realized that he was passed out.   While attempting to lay flat, I performed a jaw thrust that yielded a stridulous inspiration but was still unresponsive. He did not have a palpable carotid pulse. Paramedics was summoned emergently. Within 30-45 seconds, he awoke but was confused and amnestic to the event. He had no physical complaints and no significant medical or allergy history.   I auscultated his larynx (no stridor) and his lungs (CTA). His initial vitals: BP 90/51  HR 61  VR 16  SaO2 100% An electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm without ischemic changes or evidence of conduction delay. His glucose was 119.   Over the next 30 minutes, he was able to drink two bottles of water and some orange juice. That said, he still said he &#34;felt off.&#34; Repeat vital signs:  BP 118/62  HR 69  SaO2 100%.    The medics advised him to follow up with his doctor, preferably today. His fiance agreed to drive him to an ED near their home for a more thorough evaluation. I provided her my phone number to provide to the ED for any questions.   His clinical syndrome was consistent with a syncopal episode associated with orthostatic hypotension. Low suspicion for anaphylaxis.

I was very stressed about it and it had been six days since the shot, so I just assumed I was either having a heart attack or a really bad panic attack. I did a meditation and chewed a couple aspirin just in case.  There was extreme tightness in my chest. Breathing was difficult. The dizziness, nausea, and inability to control my body temperature went away within a couple hours and I managed to sleep. But the chest tightness and difficulty breathing persisted for about 3 or 4 days.  I also noticed it hurt more whenever I was sitting upright or forward, and it hurt almost zero when I leaned back or laid down.

                                                16 hours after my second shot, I woke up with some nausea.  I went to the bathroom, did not vomit, however in the middle of urinating I collapsed on the floor, couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t form full sentences, started sweating profusely, had to crawl back to my bed, and my pulse was through the roof.  I almost went to the ER, but the episode subsided within 15 minutes.   When I tried to fall back asleep, it felt like I was blacking out and not drifting asleep.  The next day, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms.  Followed by 4 days of normalcy.  On the 4th day, while working, I experienced a sharp 3 second &#34;electric shock&#34; feeling in my left side of my chest.   On the 5th day, I already had previously scheduled an appointment with my primary for a physical.  I told her about my episode; she took an EKG which yielded normal results.  Lab work also looked ok.  On the 6th day, I started feeling some more nausea and fatigue.  On the 7th day, the vertigo intensified tenfold, and the room was spinning.  That&#39;s when I started experiencing the following symptoms:  ? More nausea. ? Dizzy spells that come and go, especially after eating. ? Persistent periodic electric shock feeling in my left chest.  It?s dull but annoying.  And just when I think it?s gone for good, another 1 second shock happens. ? Left arm is  weak - the entire arm. ? When I try to sleep, the left side of my head feels as though I?m blacking out when I start drifting.  It almost feels like I?m getting anesthesia or something like that.  But just the left side. ? Basically the left side of my body (I got the jab in my left arm) from the waist up just feels off. ? One of my arms is numb when I wake up until I shake it out.  It?s not one particular arm. ? Energy levels are low.  Especially when I wake up and start moving around.  On the 8th day, I went to the ER thinking  perhaps it was a heart attack.  Nothing - EKG was again normal and lab work was normal.  The doctor told me it&#39;s all in my head - anxiety.  However, I&#39;m not anxious and I&#39;m a very level headed individual.    It&#39;s now day 12 and I feel overall awful.  I can&#39;t concentrate on anything.  I&#39;m not thinking clearly and forgetting simple things.  The dull feeling and electric shocks on my left side continue.  I&#39;ve never felt this bad before.  I&#39;m a healthy 34 year old that exercises regularly, has never smoked or done drugs, rarely drinks alcohol, and eats generally very healthy.  If given a second chance I would not take the covid shot.  I am praying this goes away.

                                                swelling and tenderness in lower right leg / vasculitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (administered on the right arm) on 03Apr2021 10:15 (at the age of 34-years-old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) and propranolol both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient previously took PERCOCET and experienced mild allergy. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient experienced swelling and tenderness in lower right leg / vasculitis on 06Apr2021 15:00. It was reported that 3 days after vaccination the patient experienced swelling and tenderness in lower right leg and was initially misdiagnosed as infection. After symptoms persisted for 1.5 weeks and antibiotics had no effect, it was diagnosed as vasculitis. No rheumatological issues in blood test or blood clot. PCP determined likely an immune response to the vaccine. The adverse event resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care and doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event included antibiotics and antiinflamttories. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event was recovering.

A 34-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscular in Arm Left on 17May2021 (at the age of 34-years-old) (Lot Number: EW0187) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included higher than normal blood pressure, about 2-3 weeks ago, his blood pressure was very high due to really crazy stress in his life and eating terrible; headaches, smoked marijuana, drunk vodka, sometimes he had a sensitivity to needles, sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, Sometimes he got a little queasy with the sight of needles and just had a ton of dental work done. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (Generic Brand Zyrtec); caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN) taken for headaches. He explained he took Generic Brand Zyrtec which he had been on for years now and he took Excedrin for headaches when he got them. Those were basically the only medications he took really. He hadn&#39;t had any type of vaccine. He previously had a tetanus shot about 10 years ago for Immunization. There was no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine on Monday, 17May2021. Within 3-5 minutes of getting the vaccine, he had a really crazy reaction. He remembered looking at his wife and she told him he was having mild convulsions as he was sitting in the chair in May2021. He was kind of shaking in May2021. He turned ghostly white and he began sweating profusely in May2021. He mentioned that her wife said that he was not conscious for around 5 minutes and was &#34;snoring with eyes open&#34; in May2021. He added that he was &#34;fighting to stay awake&#34; for around 15-20 minutes after that. He blacked out. All he remembers was that he was trying to fight off tunnel vision for a very brief time in May2021. The pharmacist continuously checked on him. The lightheadedness and feeling like he was going to black out lasted 15-20 minutes in May2021. They put him in a chair and told him to elevate his feet, but the caller explains he could not elevate his feet. He had his feet in another chair in front of him. He couldn&#39;t get comfortable, he was sitting down. He was restless, lightheaded. He kept feeling like he was going to pass out. So, then he tried to stand up and walk a little bit. He only made it 5 steps. So, he sat on the ground and laid down. He laid on the ground, flat on his back, and put his feet in a chair, which was about 2.5 feet above him for about 15-20 minutes. He started to feel better. He still felt very tired and weak in May2021 but he was able to stand up and walk and go home. He hadn&#39;t had a reaction since. He had had no other symptoms besides just a sore arm in May2021. He confirmed he recovered completely from his experience when he was administered the vaccine. He came home from the vaccine facility, laid on the couch and watched TV for a couple of hours and then fell asleep for 3-4 hours. He was tired, but he felt completely fine. He had no lightheadedness, no dizziness. He also wanted to add sometimes he has a sensitivity to needles, but he didn&#39;t when he received the COVID vaccine. Sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, but he was actually excited to get the COVID shot. He was even comforting his wife and was telling her everything is going to be okay. He wasn&#39;t worried about the needle with the COVID shot. Sometimes, he gets a little queasy with the sight of needles, but he saw the needle and he didn&#39;t feel faint or angst when getting the shot. He just had a ton of dental work done, where he had huge needles shoved in his mouth and he didn&#39;t feel faint or anything. He really wanted to get the second shot to finish the vaccination series. He did kind of believe he had a reaction, he was not trying to play it off and say &#34;oh I got the vaccine and passed out&#34;. He knew himself and knew what it&#39;s like to faint and this experience just felt different. He believed he had a reaction. He never felt tunnel vision that strong in his entire life, it felt like being punched in the face. Since those 2-3 weeks, his stress load had gone down and he had had a drastic change in his diet, so his blood pressure was reading much better now. This past Monday, 17May2021, when he received his vaccine, his blood pressure shouldn&#39;t have been that high.  The EMT&#39;s did come before he left and because he passed out his blood pressure was low at 100/60. When providing the Lot number off of his vaccine record card, the patient explained the last digit was either a 7 or a 2, he can&#39;t read this person&#39;s handwriting&#34;, however, he eventually confirmed the number was a 7.  The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The outcome of event tired was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovered in May2021.

Resting heart rate was around 110-120 constantly for almost 3 weeks. I just toughed it out and it ended last week, but my family and friends told me I should report it as the CDC was looking into the problem.

This Pharmacist reported for two patients, this is the first of two reports regards to a male patient.  A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular, administered in left arm on 02Jun2021 between 10:00 and 11:00 am, maybe around 10:30ish (Batch/Lot Number: EW0178; Expiration Date: Aug2021, NDC number: 59267100002) as 1ST DOSE 0.3ML, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation at pharmacy. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. A pharmacist from pharmacy had 2 patients who received the vaccine and both had a reaction after the dose, within one hour after receiving the dose, and EMS was called. The pharmacist confirmed the first patient had the reaction within 1 hour of receiving the dose. She clarified this person was having cold sweats, about to black out, had a hard time and trouble swallowing and was turning pale, his pupils were dilated. Pharmacist explained they make them sit there for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine so this reaction happened maybe 3 minutes after he got the shot. The EMS came and he was brought to the hospital. The patient did come back afterwards and he said the doctor didn&#39;t know 100 percent what happened, but it might been a slight allergic reaction, not to the point where he lost consciousness, but they did release him. She clarified they checked his vitals and everything and released him. When pharmacist was probed for the event, the pharmacist thought it was an anaphylactic reaction. The events require a visit to Emergency Room, patient was brought by EMS. Not had a visit to Physician Office. Unknown if patient received treatment, the pharmacist wasn&#39;t be told that much information. The outcome of events was unknown. Causality: In this case, pharmacist did not think so. She thinks maybe it was anxiety but she wouldn&#39;t know.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, a possible causal association between the events and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Experienced shortness of breath and sharp pain around heart area the night after receiving dose.  Was bedridden the following day.  I had to travel back on Saturday so I was trying to rest and get better.  Pain subsided a little, but the pain started back up again the weekend before Memorial Day holiday.  This time the pain was the worst.  The pain was a sharp pain around my heart area.  My left SCN muscle was also inflamed.  I was bedridden the entire weekend.  In bed, when I turned left or right when lying down I would feel pain.  I was not able to lift my head up to adjust my pillow without feeling sharp pain.  I took Ibuprofen at 800 mg every 6 hours based on doctor recommendation.  This pain lasted about 3 weeks with it gradually subsiding and now I am feeling better.  However, I still feel a little something going on in the region around my heart.

                                                I suffered from acute Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18May2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0177) (at age of 34 years) as DOSE 1, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. Known allergies was none. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Other concomitant medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included vitamin C gummies. The patient suffered from acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura on 18May2021 19:00. At the end of the 18th, patient noticed spots on arms and legs, about the size of the average mole. Later, gums bled and patient had blood blisters in mouth, from 1 to 3 after rinsing with listerine. The next day, he noticed more spots on feet and lower legs, similar to freckles. By the end of the day, his gums were bleeding unprovoked and he had hematuria. The bleeding continued and he went to the ER the following day and was informed that his platelet count dropped to 0. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Number of days of hospitalization was 3 days. Treatment received for the adverse events included Intravenous Immunoglobulin and steroids. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was recovering.  Information on Lot/Batch number is available; Further information has been requested.

Patient also reported constant chest tightness that started yesterday. Per patient, chest tightness feels similar to when he had bronchitis as a child. Pain is tolerable and does not radiate anywhere else, patient stated it is located at the sternum. Denies difficulty breathing. Patient does not sound in distress. Patient denies fever, swelling of face, rash.  Patient reported he has not taken any OTC medication to relieve his symptoms.  I consulted with MD, was concerned of his chest pain and the possibility of myocarditis from the vaccine.  Patient was highly recommended to seek ER ASAP due to his constant chest pain for more than 24 hours.  Patient verbally agrees to go to hospital now. I encouraged him for me to call EMS but patient stated he is well enough to have someone drive him and will call a service.

                                                2 days after 2nd COVID vaccine (Pfizer), started to notice random onset heart palpitations and tachycardia, as well as random minor chest pains, and occasionally moderate chest pains. chest pains could be described as a sharp pain or tightness that only lasts a second or two then typically goes away. It is now 6 months later and I am still experiencing heart issues: palpitations, elevated heart rate, fatigue, feeling &#34;winded&#34; when climbing stairs. Elevated heart rate is sometimes as high as 160bpm, even when sitting on the couch relaxing. Marijuana use will occasionally raise heart rate, but not consistently enough to be the cause of tachycardia. When heart rate is elevated, I will sometimes experience anxiety, which can lead to slight &#34;difficulties&#34; breathing (this seems to be caused by the anxiety, and when I notice my heart rate is high, I get nervous and think too much about it and probably focus too much on breathing normally)  These symptoms and issues were not present prior to receiving my 2 COVID vaccines

From the symptoms the doctor said it was a tonic-clonic seizure, and that it was a side effect of the vaccine. They told me I turned purple, stopped breathing, and exhaled the remaining air until I stopped breathing for about 30 seconds until then I came back to my senses. The firefighters examined me and all my vital signs were fine so they recommended that I go home and rest.

Medical history included covid-19 from 2019 to an unknown date doctors believe I had Covid-19 in 2019, neoplasm malignant from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The first dose of the Pfizer vaccine was on 25Jun2021, I have got this kind, out of order. So, he said from what he remembers that he was fine following the vaccination, and everything was good but he took a few steps and collapsed. He started having a seizure and he said, my mom said, you stopped breathing, I was unconscious, tightness of chest I can breathe but it&#39;s like I cannot get any oxygen it&#39;s like very hard for me to get air. He says, the doctors there, the doctors, he says don&#39;t get me started on the (sentence incomplete) and he went to the hospital and was there for like 5 hours and they gave him 5 mg of Valium treatment and he said that was it. They could not find his vein, they did an ultrasound, I guess to find his vein and apparently, he had a couple of seizures. He says, I don&#39;t recall, all I remember is waking up in a hospital and I received the Pfizer vaccine first dose and then he said, 3 days ago, technically, I got Pneumonia vaccine which he said he received the PPSV23 vaccine prior the same day of his Pfizer vaccine. Also, he says, I hate needles, so I got tortured. I had the pneumonia vaccine (PPSV23 vaccine) first, he was with his mom, they went out for a while and then went back to where he got the Pfizer vaccine following that (PPSV23 Vaccine). He said, he was there after the Pfizer vaccine for about 30 minutes, got up and had a seizure and he says, that also his mom said that he cannot remember anything because he was unconscious, and they took him to the hospital. Also, he said, he lost his sense of taste, I cannot smell, he said, he was feeling like tingling sensation in his hands like numbness and left arm hurt a lot and hand was swollen. In 2019, he says, he got sick with respiratory issues. He was not sure if he had Covid because they did not know about Covid at that time when he was in the hospital then (consumer had respiratory issues before getting the vaccine, hence not captured as event). He said, it was freaking him out and he was scared to take the second shot. He said, he does not know if this was the combination of getting two vaccination and he says, he used to have cancer (not clarified further, hence not captured as event) and then he says, that they did blood work, it was been followed by the place and they did not tell me anything about the blood work. He says, should I be considered or concerned about getting the second dose of the vaccine because I am experiencing various symptoms and what can I do about my side effects because he is still experiencing metallic taste, loss of smell, fatigue, coughing of Phlegm, having a hard time getting to sleep. Then he says, I forgot to mention, I could feel my heartbeat and I have a cough, I have had a cough from very long time when doctors believe I had Covid-19 in 2019 (further clarification unknown). He wanted to know how safe the vaccine was. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of seizure, unconscious, passed out. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis; Slurring his speech; Stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 35-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in deltoid (unknown if right or left) on 17Dec2020 at 30 ug, single for &#39;Preventative&#39;. Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications.(Physician) He is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. States what is going on with the patient may be associated as a side effect. The patient got the vaccine two to three weeks ago, he clarifies the patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and the patient ended up acutely developing (states it is a presumptive diagnosis) Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, states it looks like a radiologic diagnosis. The patient is an employee at hospital. When querying seriousness states it is medically significant but could be disabling but he thinks the patient will recover. Reporter seriousness for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis: Medically significant, Hospitalization. Patient was hospitalized on Sunday and he is still admitted at this time. Dates when patient was in hospital for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from 03Jan2021 to ongoing. Caller thinks the patient was flown to (Place) yesterday. The patient&#39;s mother asked the caller if the caller thought the acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from the vaccine and the caller responded that he did not think it was from the vaccine. He confirms the patient is still admitted in the hospital and the patient&#39;s attending neurologist is doctor. The caller heard about the patient from doctor. When querying covid vaccine dose, the caller states the standard dose is 30 mcg. This was clarified and documented as provided. The patient has not received his second dose yet. He asks if the patient should receive the second dose. He asks a general question if a pregnant patient can be given the Pfizer covid vaccine. He heard the patient had a stroke then the CFO tried to talk to him and the patient was slurring his speech. Caller spoke to the patient&#39;s mother this morning and caller told the mother that he would try to find out what is going on with the patient.  He asked that the patient get an HIV test even though he does not think the patient is at risk. Vaccination facility type was Hospital. Vaccine administered at military facility was No. None additional vaccines administered on same date of the PFIZER suspect. AE acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis require a visit to Emergency Room, not visit to physician office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. He has heard of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis being associated with vaccines in the past and states that it is rare and usually in kids. States he saw patients that may have had acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis back in the 80s and 90s. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (Patient will get steroids tonight pending the review of the x-ray). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke with speech slurred, and the presumptive diagnosis of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (looks like a radiologic diagnosis by the reporting physician), was most likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

                                                I had the normal symptoms of pain at injection site, headache, fatigue, chills, muscle aches.  I did get a fever for a short duration.  The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

A 35-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via intramuscular on the left arm, on 21Jan2021 at 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. No history of allergic reactions to any meds (medication) in the past or other vaccines in childhood. Otherwise young healthy male with no history of hypertension. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EJ1686) via intramuscular on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 16:00 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe elevation of blood pressure. On 22Jan2021, at 12:00 AM, after the 2nd dose in left arm, after about 24 to 48 hours, the patient experienced vesicular pruritic erythematous patches in multiple locations of my left arm, left arm pit, left upper back, left chest occurred, peaking on day three and still remain after one week. The blisters have opened leaving behind painful ulcers. This is not a rash that disappears in a few days. It will take much longer than that to heal. No rash with the first dose. Also, with both doses, had severe elevation of blood pressure as high as 180/100 within 2 to 5 hours on 22Jan2021, requiring about 3 doses of clonidine over 7 days where bp would cycle up and down. The seriousness of the events was reported as non-serious. Since the vaccination, the patient has been not tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events and included Benadryl, mometasone cream and clonidine. The outcome of the events was reported as recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Severe elevation of blood pressure as high as 180/100; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician reporting for himself. A 35-year-old male received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686 and expiry date unknown), intramuscular on 30Dec2020 16:00 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Patient has no medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. Patient has no known allergies. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at the hospital. Patient received the second dose on 21Jan2021 16:00 (lot number: EL1283) intramuscular on the left arm. After the second dose in left arm, after about 24 to 48 hours, vesicular pruritic erythematous patches in multiple locations of my left arm, left arm pit, left upper back, left chest occured, peaking on day three and still remain after ond week. The blisters have opened leaving behind painful ulcers. This is not a rash that disappears in a few days. It will take much longer than that to heal. There was no rash with the first dose. Also, with both doses, patient had severe elevation of blood pressure as high as 180/100 within 2 to 5 hours on 30Dec2020, requiring about 3 doses of clonidine over 7 days where blood pressure would cycle up and down. Patient has no history of allergic reactions to any medications in the past or other vaccines in childhood. Otherwise, young healthy male with no history of hypertension. The adverse event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Patient was recovering from the event. Event reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of blood pressure increased. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

There were a few moments during the first half hour of receiving the shot that I thought I might pass out. When the nurse took my blood pressure it was 184/81, which is not normal for me. It took about an hour for it to get back down to a normal level. Afterwards, I felt very jittery for a while.

They asked me if I had pain and I said no. Just a high heart rate. WAs told to monitor it. Next day, I had chest pain and tightness in chest and fast heartrate. I went to ER. Gave me IV; fluids and steroids. They sent me home with steroids for five days. About three or four days after steroids were done, it resolved the symptoms.

Possibly some worsening exercise tolerance ~3-4 weeks after initial onset date. I&#39;m not sure if it was deconditioning vs lingering covid effects.   No side effects from first covid vaccine minus a sore arm. After second dose some mild fatigue ~2 days. Then 12 days after second dose significant more fatigue and in the next few days chills at night and tachycardia with pulse in 120s at rest. No fever, pain, sob, swelling or other symptoms. Presented to immediate care on 2/27 predominantly for the tachycardia. Was referred to the ED.  Discharged on 3/1 on metoprolol with possible diagnosis of viral myocarditis.

And now happens randomly throughout the day 10 times an hour approximately mostly in arm, but also in butt and shoulder and legs. I also feel heart jolts 2-3 times an hour.

Jail nurse brought his inhaler and listened to his lungs with a stethoscope. She reported that his lungs sounded clear bilaterally. Pt reported that using his inhaler helped his breathing and made his chest feel better. He also complained that his legs and head were &#34;burning.&#34; When asked to elaborate, he said it felt hot and like he was experiencing pressure but not pain. His legs and face were expected skin color, dry, and without any raised or itchy patches. Pt was able to speak coherently and without difficulty throughout, and muscle tone was strong during entire reaction. Nurses remained with pt for approximately 35 minutes post vaccination. Epi was prepared but not administered. About 30 minutes after vaccination patient reported feeling better and was breathing smoothly.

After approximately 10 minutes he was leaning over reading materials and fainted. I went to patient who was stirring and he dazed but coherent. I assessed for serious anaphylactic rxn and EMT was called. They arrived in 5-10 minutes and did additional testing showing no serious concerns (blood sugar, BP, and EKG). He reported seasonal allergies that at times caused light headed feelings.   Patient decided he did not wish to go to ER and left with his companion. No further reports at this time

This 35- year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration, on 12Apr2021 at 09:30 am (at the age of 35-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination, in left arm. The facility where COVID-19 vaccine was administered was a hospital. No known allergies. Patient has no relevant medical history. States: I live a healthy lifestyle diet, exercise, proper rest. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 12Apr2021 10:00 am, the patient stated: I passed out and or blacked out on my drive home from the hospital. I was careful to follow the 15minute wait period before I left the hospital and was ok at that point. I had tense nerve feelings came over me as it grew so strong, I was forced to try and get my car on an off ramp to leave the highway I was on. I thankfully did not get any real injuries to my body as I spun and landed on the side of the road in the grass area. However, this experience was horrifying to say the least. I had a delayed reaction to this vaccine, other than this one incident, I really only had the typical body aches or pain for 24 hours and a bit of nerve twitching. I will not mark this as a risk of death, because it was my driving a car that risked my safety not the vaccine, however, the vaccine did cause the black out. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination.  Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

He states that he has about 30 seconds to know if he is going to pass out. His wife who was right beside the patient said he also he skin turns color as well. I gave him his vaccination. I had him sit in chair to see how he was feeling. He said he was feeling fine. I had him sit about five feet from me in supportive, armed chair. I was preparing to vaccinate his wife. We looked over and his face started turning pale and green. His wife and I immediately went to both his sides to support him and lower his head to his lap. He became conscious about 5-10 seconds later. This all occurred within 3 minutes of the administration of the shot. I gave him a drink. I continued to observe him for 15 minutes until he left. He was alert and fine when leaving the store. I called the patient&#39;s home on April 25, 2021. Patient was at work. I spoke with his wife who said he was feeling fine. I recommended he check in with his doctor regarding second shot.

                                                Started feeling really anxious and shy of breath about 5 minutes after receiving second shot but I only thought I was nervous from receiving it so I thought nothing of it. Common side effects such as chills, headache and severe drowsiness lasted 2 maybe 3 days but the anxious feeling in my chest is still there. Heart palpitations is what I am having and it?s constant. There have been times at work that I can feel my heart beat in my pant legs, temples, wrists and forehead from ordinary stress that I?ve have no issues handling in the past 4 years. Every 30-60 seconds I have to take a deep breath to catch my breath regardless of what I am doing. Suddenly severe drowsiness. I?m sure there?s more that I?m forgetting.

Patient briefly convulsed and passed out post vaccination. Reaction was immediately and woke up a few seconds shortly after his name was called a couple times by the vaccinator. Patient admitted that he was very nervous and scared of needle, but denied ever experience fainting and convulsing. Patient was instructed to sit in the pharmacy for 30 minutes for observation. He rejected our offer to call EMT/Paramedics and for someone else to pick him up instead of driving himself. Patient received 4 cups of water from pharmacy. When he left at 30 minute mark, he was stable.

                                                After 2nd dose of COVID19 vaccine (taken 3 weeks after first dose) I had a feeling of a mild fever/chills and low energy and body aches about 12 hours after the injection. However I also begin getting a lot of pain and tightness around my right rib cage intercostal muscle area and lower back (QL area to Lats). This made it harder to breath and hurt while I laid down to sleep. It also hurt to take a deep breath/cough/laugh etc. This lasted until Thursday night (4/29/21) when the same kind of pain moved over to my left side. The past 2 days it has become quite intense though making it impossible to sleep on my back last night (I had to sit upright to avoid intense pain) and painful to even walk. It still hurts in my left rib cage at rest (feels more like a dull ache and stiff), but intensifies if I try to expand my lungs with breathing or lie down or move in any way. Mainly intercostal area around the rib cage and the back around my lung. Thought I might have to go to the emergency room last night it was so bad.

I told him that I would keep him seated after until he felt ok, his wife was with him and I told her that if he started feeling bad to let me know as I went back into the pharmacy.  About 5 minutes after his immunization he said he didn&#39;t feel well.  I went out to check on him he said he was hot  and then he lost consciousness.  His wife and I were not able to wake him,  911 was called and  I grabbed the Epipen 0.3mg and gave him 1 dose in the left thigh.  Shortly after he started to respond.  Once awake he began vomiting and still complained of being very hot.  His wife splashed water on his face and we kept talking to him until EMS arrived about 5 minutes after the Call.  EMS  checked him out, he refused to go to the hospital and refused them to take him to his car when he felt better.  He walked out on his own after about another 20 minutes with his wife.  I called to check on his around 4pm and he said that he was feeling ok.

This progressed to severe sx with malaise/lightheadedness, and he was admitted to a local hospital with a diagnosis of septic shock and possible L neck cellulitis. Transferred again to other hospital where he had refractory shock and EF &lt; 15% with global hypkinesis, and finally xferred on 4/28/21 to other hospital. Had PEA arrest in (second hospital) and in transit - resuscitated and placed emergently on ECMO. Overall, picture appears more consistent with viral myocarditis. He has recovered systolic function and is off ECMO and extubated currently.

                                                My condition rapidly went down the hill right before bed time. I woke up because of me screaming my wife&#39;s name. I tried to get to my phone but my hands were out control for roughly 10 seconds - i never experienced such thing in my life (i will try to describe it - i could move them around shoulder but the rest looked like tentacles - no control over fingers too) . Around 5 seconds into trying to grab my phone i was completely awoken and realized that i covered in cold sweat, my heart rate is extremely high (when i returned control over my limbs i checked and it was &gt;120, when i sleep i usually have around 45). Based on my smart watches my heart rate went all the way up to 160 at the moment when i woke up.   Heart rate went down to ~80 and after 20-30 minutes or measuring everything possible (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level, etc) we decided not to call 911. The rest of the night was ok&#39;ish - in AM i checked smartwatch data and my average heart rate was 60 which is 10-15 above normal. Next morning welcomed me with moderate fever (37.5C), joints pain (also never experienced at such scale - literally entire body), headache and bunch of other annoying things (including one impacting vision - until lunch time everything had higher contrast).  Two days after i completely recovered.

                                                Symptoms started approximately 14 hours post-vaccination.  Day 1 symptoms:   - Fever (&lt;= 101.0 degrees F)   - Chills   - Headache   - Fatigue/tiredness   - Vomiting (one time exactly 24 hours post onset of symptoms)  Days 2 - 5 symptoms:   - Severe pain/tightness and fatigue feeling in both arms, shoulder blades, and chest.  This has slowly improved over days 2 through 5.   - Nausea associated with the pain/tightness noted above   - Coughing (no phlegm)   - Vomiting (one more time on day 2 exactly 24 hours after the first vomiting episode)   - Fever and chills (both resolved by days 2-3)  Treatments:   - 500 mg Tylenol was used to treat fever and pain during the first several days.  Fever was well controlled, but pain was only partially controlled   - On days 3&#43; Advil was used for pain relief and it was effective   - Alka Seltzer Gold was used to treat nausea as necessary.  It was not particularly effective as the nausea seemed linked to the severity of the pain.  When the pain eased, the nausea did as well.   Outcomes:   - Symptoms have slowly improved over the 5 days post 2nd dose vaccination.  Advil has been discontinued since the afternoon of day 4.  No fever is present and the pain is now only mild.

                                                According to my wife, 10 minutes post shot I had what appeared to be a mild seizure and lost consciousness for 1-2 minutes. Prior to that happening, I told her I felt light headed. She notified personnel while we were in the 15 min wait holding area and when I regained consciousness two EMTs were checking me out. They took my vitals, asked me questions and had me get out of the car and walk around. I was monitored for several minutes. It was recommended I visit a hospital or urgent care if I continued to feel unwell. My wife &amp; I left the vaccine site and decided on the way home to go to the hospital just to ensure everything was all right. We went back home for about 30-60 minutes. During this time my heart rate continued to remain elevated and it felt like I had adrenaline coursing through my system. I attributed the feeling to recovering from passing out, but it did not dissipate.  Upon arrival to the ER I began having trouble trying to breathe and chest pain. During the triage EKG it was discovered I was experiencing atrial fibrillation. I was given treatment, fluids and monitored for several hours before being released. Estimated time from receiving shot to being diagnosed with afib was approximately 2.5-3 hours.

A 35-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 07May2021 15:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EW 0171; Expiration Date: Aug2021) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation, at a public Health Department. The vaccine was not administered at Military Facility. No additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa. No family Medical History Relevant to events. There were no concomitant medications. There was no other products. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. For historical vaccine, there was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks aside from first dose: bnt162b2, dose 1 intramuscular administered in Arm Left on 16Apr2021 15:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER 8737; Expiration Date: Aug2021) (at the age of 35-year-old) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The facility of vaccination was Other no AE. On 08May2021 02:00, the patient experienced chest pain. The event chest pain resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, and was life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). On 13May2021, the patient&#39;s wife reported that her husband was in the hospital with myocarditis onset from 11May2021(also reported as three days after receiving his second dose of the vaccine). The patient was admitted to the hospital at 02:00 on Tuesday 11May2021, he was still in the hospital by the time of reporting. Also reported that the event myocarditis required Emergency Room visit. A lot of testing were done such as cardiac ultrasounds, several electrocardiogram (EKG)s and electrocardiogram (ECG)s, nuclear cardiac wall motion test or some kind of nuclear test she is unsure of the name, chest x-rays three times, several blood works, his troponin levels (heart enzyme) was critical. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. The patient had been tested post vaccination, COVID test type post vaccination was Nasal Swab on 11May2021, result was Negative. The patient had full work up less than a year ago and everything came back completely normal (In 2020). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events chest pain and myocarditis. The patient was treated with medication and he had to get a wearable defibrillator called Life Vest. They have him on a blood thinner, carvedilol, and entresto. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Patient immediately could verify his name, DOB, what just happened etc. Declined any symptoms that would indicate any form of allergic reaction. Said he felt dizzy/lightheaded/sweaty. Sat patient up after a couple minutes and took a blood pressure. It read 103/52. Patient then informed me he does pass out after shots. He says he doesn&#39;t get vaccines because of his fear of needles but in the past when he had a shot for a medication he has passed out. Took another blood pressure about 10 minutes later which read 126/86. Patient also informed me he hadn&#39;t ate/drank anything all day and did work all day prior. Got patient a pop to help with any low blood sugar. Patient had a friend pick him up, didn&#39;t want an ambulance, said he felt fine after 30ish minutes passed by besides a minor headache.

                                                started as severe dizziness and weakness, chest pain was hospitalized once I got to the ER because my heart was not working properly, after many test the found my heart was in heart failure with an output of 35% only, was in hospital for 5 days. Doctors couldn&#39;t see what caused such a sudden weakness of the heart, they did cardio path and arteries have zero blockage, they did ECO, and a EP Study. My heart now suffers from PVCs or arrhythmia and they are very irregular and frequent. Was given medicine to help the heart and control the PVCs, and discharged with wearing a safety vest, to follow up with the cardio doctors. Followed up with doctors and they have done an MRI which shows scarring of the heart. The doctor has determined that the diagnosis is myocardiatis. There is no proof this direct relation with the vaccine,  however symptoms started soon after the vaccine in a healthy young man. Now I still have to go to another electrophysiologist to see what he can do to help alleviate the PVCs and continue to take the medication to see of the heart can improve. I could not work for a month, and still cannot resume normal activities because my heart is to weak to sustain it.

                                                I have experienced a light headed feeling ever since I got the first Covid dose of the Pfizer brand.  I did have a very brief dizzy spell about 25 minutes after I received the vaccine but that disappeared then and never returned.  I have contacted my PCP about the light headed feeling and I think they may be trying to look into it further because it did not go away in a few days after the shot.  They told me if it changes to dizziness to definately contact them back.  It hasn&#39;t become dizziness yet.  The light headed feeling comes and goes at times but it always seems to come back and I still have it today.  Due to the light headed feeling I did check my blood pressure and blood sugar levels and they were both in the normal healthy range that I have always had.  I also experienced flu like symptoms as a side effect for 4 or 5 days after the shot as well as fatigue.  Also the one night after the vaccination I had a very brief epsiode of a thumping heart beat but that didn&#39;t last very long.  I have never experienced the heart rate thing before either.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 35-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 31Mar2021 09:00 (at the age of 35-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, beta carotene, biotin, boron, calcium, calcium pantothenate, chloride, chromium, colecalciferol, copper, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, iodine, iron, lycopene, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, nicotinamide, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, silicon dioxide, thiamine, tin, tocopheryl acetate, vanadium, vitamin k nos, zinc (CENTRUM MEN). The patient previously took bactrim and experienced allergies. Historical vaccine includes BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN 6206), administered in left arm on 10Mar2021 at 08:45 AM (at the age of 35-year-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. On 27Apr2021 at 08:00 AM, the patient experienced bilateral embolisms (blood clots in lungs) and also had blood clot in left leg. Symptoms before diagnosis included dry cough, coughing up blood, chills, fever, body aches, and body pains. The events caused hospitalization. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test via nasal swab post vaccination which was negative on 29Apr2021 and on 07May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of bilateral pulmonary embolisms and had blood clot in left leg, chills, and body aches/body pains which included Lovenox injection (blood thinner) and Tylenol for pain.

                                                Irregular heartbeat lasting at least one week following my second dose of Pfizer. Began around May 14 &amp; is beginning to settle as of May 23. Frequency has decreased immensely over the last few days. Was having irregular heartbeat consistently throughout the day for nearly five days straight &amp; am now only experiencing 0-1 times per day. I am currently living out of the country &amp; had returned to my home to receive my first dose of Pfizer in April. I had been home for one month before departing back on May 10th &amp; began experiencing side effects four days after my return (roughly one week after my second dose). I currently do not have a doctor to report to back home, &amp; had not yet seen my doctor here to report the irregularity. Note: I did not experience symptoms with my first shot.

Also developed constant sub-sternal chest pain.  Worse with movement or deep inspiration.  No clear positional component.   CP persisted until he came to the ED today.  Initial ECG showed concave ST elevations lateral leads.  Given his history this was felt to be most consistent with pericarditis.  He received toradol, morphine and SL NTG with near complete relief of the pain.  Repeat ECG showed resolution ST elevations.  Troponin was elevated, peak 9.08 ng/ml.

                                                Patient had fainted after receiving the vaccine and when I came to saw him, he was back on the chair. He said he felt faint. I asked if his breathing was alright, his sight and hearing was ok; he said everything was fine, but he still felt faint. Then I saw his eyes closing again and he slouched down on the chair and became unconscious. I helped him onto the ground, where he started shaking, so I rolled him onto his side. He felt clammy. It was a few seconds before he stopped shaking and opened his eyes again. I asked him to stay laying on the ground and asked him again regarding his breathing, hear rate, vision, how he felt. He asked if he passed out again and I told him yes and we&#39;re going to keep him on the ground until paramedics arrive. He said he felt better; his breathing and speech was fine, there wasn&#39;t any sound of shortness of breath, but he was sweating in cold sweats and he asked us to fan him. He said that he felt better and that he has a big phobia of needles, which his wife who was there, confirmed. He informed me that he&#39;s fainted several times at doctor&#39;s office and hospitals when they stick a needle in him. When the fire fighters arrived, they spoke to him prepared to get a EKG on him, to which he immediately told them that he doesn&#39;t want them to stick any needles in him and he became frightened that the EKG pads were needles. When paramedics came, they determined that they had to take him to the hospital because they said he wasn&#39;t able to stand up on his own without falling over and his heart rate was increasing.

Monitored at the site with an oxymeter and bp monitor. Eventually it went back to normal and I was able to leave. The event of my heart BP and pulse rising happened multiple times during that day. Called my doctor after.  2nd dose: same event as first dose, but this time it came on almost immediately after the shot was completed. Elevated BP and heart rate. I was not getting better so I was wheeled in to the hospital where I had some testing done and released maybe 5 hours later. All heart tests were normal.   Within about a week of the 2nd dose I was at home relaxing and my heart rate went up to 150 and then back down to 59 and then back up again. I had an oxymeter on that was monitoring it and it kept fluctuating between 59-150 and I could feel it rise and drop. I was admitted to the ER then discharged. I was told it was a possible vaccine side effect. Cardiologist appointment a few weeks later where again I was told it may have been related.  Since the vaccine I have recurring episodes as detailed above. Racing heart, headaches etc.

These symptoms lasted for approximately 8 hours. Since the episode I have noticed periodic episodes of shortness of breath and chest fluttering.

He lost consciousness but was making snorting/snoring noises and was having muscle contractions that left him rolling around in his chair. This lasted about 2 minutes. He then turned very red and it appeared that he wasn&#39;t breathing. I removed his facemask and yelled his name/patted his chest and he began to regain consciousness. He sat for several minutes and said he felt fine.

                                                My first COVID19 Pfizer vaccine shot was on 4/05/21. My second was 3 weeks later on 4/26/21.  About 30 hours after my second vaccine on 4/27/21 I started to notice tightness around my lungs/rib cage in the intercostal muscle area. For the next few days the pain increased and I had shortness of breath as well. After a few nights I couldn&#39;t lie down to sleep because of this pain so I had to sit upright to sleep.   On 5/3/21 I went to the doctor at hospital where I was examined and had a lung X-ray as well as a COVID PCR test (it was negative). The PA diagnosed me with &#34;Pneumonia&#34; and I was given antibiotics (cefuroxime and azithromycin) to take for 6-7 days.  I started feeling a little better by 5/6/21 and actually reported here on VAERS with my diagnosis of suspected Pneumonia. On 5/17/21 I had another lung x-ray at hospital and was told my lungs were looking more clear. However, for the next 2 weeks I felt more tired and my poor breathing, a cough with bloody mucus, and more chest/rib cage area pain developed. Despite being a professional runner it became hard to walk up a flight of stairs without breathing really hard and feeling light-headed.   On  5/30/21 I woke up with fairly intense chest pain just under my heart. I was taken to the ER at second Hospital and got a CT scan with contrast that showed a bilateral Pulmonary Embolism with infract. An ultra sound of my heart (normal) and blood panels were performed as well as multiple EKGs. I was given a stomach injection of Lovenox also. That afternoon I was transferred to third Hospital. for overnight monitoring with more EKGs and Lovenox injections. Prescribed blood thinner Pradaxa for 3 months with no known cause of clots that caused this Pulmonary Embolism. Kidney test and Heart appeared normal. Still waiting on genetic testing. Lung infract has caused lasting chest pain and my breathing has yet to return back to normal.

                                                I&#39;m a registered RN at medical center. I received two doses of Pfizer COVID vaccine. I had no pre-existing medical conditions. After couple weeks I developed sudden onset chest pain. I went to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack. I wet through a heart catheterization with no vessel blockages and my EKG was reading NSTEMI. I was hospitalized for a total of two weeks. I was on high doses of anti-inflammatory medication.

I was working and thought I was going to pass out so I went home, and I tried calling the hospital, but they said they couldn&#39;t recommend if I should go in or not. A week after that every joint in my body was killing me. I had a little bit of breathing issues probably about a week after. Chest tightness, not being able to get a full breath. 48-72 hours after that my knuckles and joints were hurting. 48 hours after that the tightness in chest started and the trouble breathing. I did not go to an urgent care. My brain just feels like it shut off a little bit and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just something in my head or not.

He was in the CICU for a week and a half. Unfortunately, my brother passed away from the Pfizer vaccine. Until his last day the doctors still &#34;didn&#39;t know&#34; what was wrong with him. A lot happened during his hospital stay, but this is just a brief statement. They have been keeping his medical records from me. They tested him repeatedly there from covid and he wa salways negative. They had no other explanation to what was happening and all along they wanted it to be COVID-19 and were so quick to say it was not the vaccine.

Upon checking vitals was tachycardic with heart rate in 120s; drop in blood pressure to 100/50 (my baseline is 120/75).  No wheezing. No stridor. Oxygen saturations 99%. No hives or rash. No facial or peripheral swelling.  Provided fluids (by mouth), cold compresses, and benadryl. Gradual improvement after this.  Majority of symptoms lasted for approx 1 to 1.5 hours; with some waxing/waning palpitations for another~1 hour.  I have no prior history of similar symptoms after receiving vaccines or medications in the past.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Dec2020 at 15:00 (at the age of 36-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported; however, there were no other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of the vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. On 23Dec2020 at 15:00, the patient experienced a hot feeling in the back of the throat behind the nose and down the throat and then heaviness on the chest and it was harder to breathe. The patient was treated for the hot feeling in the back of the throat behind the nose and down the throat and then heaviness on the chest and it was harder to breathe with 50 mg of oral diphenhydramine (BENADRYL). Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The clinical outcomes of the hot feeling in the back of the throat behind the nose and down the throat and then heaviness on the chest and it was harder to breathe were resolved on Dec2020.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I stopped and walked- it dropped to 168 so I slowed down and it spiked again.  With any exercise since vaccine my heart rate has been elevated.  I have had heart palpitations- two days after the vaccine and blood pressure was high for me.  Blood pressure is not back down but still slightly higher than usual- I have slowed my normal exercise routines down but I am experiencing tightness in chest.

Led to development of pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology, atrial flutter, and subsegmental pulmonary embolism. Workup of other causes of pericardial effusion (e.g., infection, malignancy, autoimmune), and hypercoagulability were otherwise negative. 2nd dose of vaccine was on 1/4/2021 and pericardial effusion was diagnosed and evacuated on 2/14/2021. Patient hospitalized from 2/14/2021-2/17/2021. Patient is also healthcare provider.

Woke up morning of 2/19 and observed extensive petechiae and bloody nose consistent with low platelet count and ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura). I was previously diagnosed with ITP and platelet count was 262k confirmed by blood work a couple days before 2nd vaccine. Morning after got blood draw confirming platelets dropped to below 1k. Medical emergency and sent to ER. Admitted and received emergency treatment to increase platelet counts. Ended up requiring splenectomy on 2/22/21. Just discharged from hospital. Multiple medical providers advised me to submit report to VAERS.

Then as he was walking to schedule his second appointment soon after the vaccine, he fell to his knees (no CHI).  I was notified and ran over to see pt was disoriented, pale, diaphoretic.  While measuring his left arm BP (80/30), he began to convulse with both elbows flexed.  The convulsions lasted about 10 secs, pt did not recall the event, we held him in a seated position on the floor.  He felt much better after the convulsion &#43; water/snacks, however we did call EMS during the event.  Per EMS, BP was 128/80, and pt was AAOx3.  Pt refused to go to the hospital and agreed to f/up with PCP.

This was followed by a spread of the flush/warm feeling across the face, chest and arms followed immediately by a 2-3 minute panic feeling, chest tightness and extremely heightened anxiety with a general feeling of being unable to focus/concentrate. After this couple of minutes the flushing stopped in all areas except the cheeks and the itching sensation dissipated quickly over the next 30 minutes but the feeling of swelling on the roof of the mouth continued for a total of one hour. There were no visible signs of swelling in the mouth, tongue or throat, nor redness in the face. The flushing feeling settled in both cheeks of the face and was accompanied by heightened anxiety, along with an overall feeling of being warm. However, there were no visible signs of redness or rash, the sensations and anxiety persisted for mildly for 10 hours, all of which gradually dissipating over time. That night physical symptoms had cleared up, soreness in the right arm began and lasted into the morning. Anxiety levels mostly returned to normal in the morning.

                                                upon injection, immediate dizziness and slightly faint along with weird tingling and weakness feeling in hands and feet. Had mild headache and mild arm ache which went away after 2 days, no fever, site redness, no chills. It has now been 10 days and I still have tingling and weakness mainly in hands and feet but sometimes it spreads to calfs, thighs, and arms. It feels like the beginning stages of a charlie horse about 25% of the time and I am getting 1 to 2 charlie horses each day.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

                                                This patient was vaccinated with the  vaccine at approx 1530, in the left arm. He was sitting in the observation area for his allotted 15 minutes. At approx 1540 this nurse was called over by a staff member and was told that this patient was feeling dizzy, hot and nauseous. This patient presented as diaphoretic and pale.  RN&#39;s, came over to the patient and began asking basic demographic info questions, and started to measure his vital signs. This patient denied any heart issues or past medical history. His father was present and was seated next to the patient. We had the patient move onto a cot and we had the patient lay down and we elevated his feet. The patients initial vital signs were: 110/70, HR 56 and O2 99% at 1543. He stated that he felt some shortness of breath but was able to speak to us without difficulty. No wheezing or rhonchi present. We kept the patients legs elevated and provided a cold pack to his head and neck. After approx 10 minutes the patient stated he felt better, but he felt cold and his legs and upper body were shaking. Once we sat him up into a sitting position he stated he wasn&#39;t feeling dizzy. We kept him there for another 10 minutes until he felt better. His vital signs were measured again and his bp was 140/90, HR 91 and O2 level was 99%. The patient denied any difficulty breathing. This nurse advised for the patient and his father to go to the Emergency Room if another episode of this occurs. The patient understood and he walked with his father to their car without any difficulty.

                                                I had the 1st shot on Wednesday March 10th. On Sunday the 14th, just before going to bed at about 11pm, I went to pee. The urine was very dark brown. Didn&#39;t appear to have any red for blood. The next day I felt like water was being retained and it felt that I couldn&#39;t empty the bladder and pee was coming out slower than usual. Late Monday the 15th before bed I peed another dark brown urine and a red blood clot came out. At that point I became very concerned and sent to see the doctor on the 16th. Referred to a kidney specialist for March 31st. Between March 14th to March 29th , somedays I felt like I was retaining water, most days felt like I couldn&#39;t empty my bladder with slow flow. With the recent news of the concerns of blood clots with vaccines, I felt that I should report this.

A 36-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: Em9810, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 08Feb2021 at 09:30 (age at vaccination was 36 years) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The facility where most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was other. Medical history included type 1 diabetes, asthma and allergy to sulfas. Concomitant medications included aspart (FIASP INSULIN), minerals nos, vitamins nos (CENTRUM), vitamin d nos and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC); the patient received all these within 2 weeks of vaccination, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) administered in right arm on 18Jan2021 at 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EI3302) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient was type 1 diabetic. On 08Feb2021 at 20:00 patients blood sugar was slightly elevated (170mg/dl) 12-24h post injection and severely elevated (200-270mg/dl) 24-32h after injection. More significantly his body was insulin resistant during that time. At time of writing, it was 35h past injection and blood sugar has normalized and insulin again started behaving normally. The event was reported as non-serious with no seriousness criteria (Results in death / Life threatening/ Caused/prolonged hospitalization/ Disabling/Incapacitating/ Congenital anomaly/birth defect). The outcome of the events was recovered/resolved in 2021.

A 36-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number; Unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as SINGLE DOSE, dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 21Mar2021 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number; Unknown) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced he had symptoms of an illness (perhaps covid like symptoms) starting on 19mar2021 (between his 1st &amp; 2nd dose of pfizer biontech). (illness) on 18Mar2021, admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident) (hospitalization) on 08Apr2021. The patient was hospitalized for admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident) on 08Apr2021 in ICU currently/still as of 11Apr2021, not yet recovered. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 18Mar2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 08Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident). A 36 year old brother in law of my friend. He had symptoms of an illness (perhaps covid like symptoms) starting on 19Mar2021 (between his 1st &amp; 2nd dose of Pfizer BioNTech). He went ahead and got his 2nd dose on 21March2021. He then went to see his dr in the last week (week of 05Apr2021 I believe) because of not being well. That primary care dr thought the patient had perhaps been exposed to covid between the 1st &amp; 2nd doses (due to symptoms that the dr thought seemed like body&#39;s over-reaction to covid) but a covid test was done and it was negative. Then the patient has been admitted to (Hospital name) in (city name) (state name) suffering from a stroke on 08Apr2021. He still has not tested positive for covid (again) but he is in ICU at (Hospital name) with stroke symptoms. This was all related to my by the sister-in-law (my friend (name)). I wanted to report since the 2nd dose Pfizer BioNTech was taken on 21Mar2021 &amp; then in hospital ICU with a stroke (at 36 yrs old) on 08Apr2021.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

Only other symptoms were mild arm pain and mild headache, no fever, no chills.&#34; The events occurred on 17Mar2021 at 15:00 (03:00 PM). The outcome of the events was recovering. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The treatment was unknown.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

At this time the patient was laid back in seat and given water to drink cold wash cloth. I continued to talk with him and reassure him while monitoring his vitals to make sure they were coming up. After a couple of minutes the patient was feeling better and HR was 72 and o2 sat was 99 we continued to monitor another 30 minutes.

                                                Later the same day I began to feel stomach constipation and chills. I took a hotter than usual shower to calm the chills. After getting out of the shower and laying down my heart was beating 2x as fast throughout the majority of the night and I could feel blood pressure all throughout my body which made my skin unusually warm. Also there was a slight headache nothing too serious. These symptoms lasted for several hours and subsided early morning which contributed to tiredness next day.

                                                I went to bed around 10pm feeling very cold an shivering. I was able to fall asleep, but then I woke up at 2am feeling very thirsty and experiencing intense nausea. I got out of bed to get some water. When I exited the room the nausea intensified so I knelt on the floor to wait until it passed. It didn&#39;t really pass so I stood up to try and get back to the bed. After a few steps I blacked out and fell to the floor. I was only unconscious for a few seconds, as confirmed by my wife who heard me fall. When I came to, I was lying face down and still experiencing intense nausea. I was also very hot and sweating, and very thirsty. I laid with my eyes closed an breathing very heavily to suppress the urge to vomit for a minute or two. When the urge to vomit began to subside I took a few sips of water while still lying on the ground. After another minute or two I was able to get up and get back into bed. The extreme nausea subsided after a few more minutes and I was able to drink more water. I went back to sleep after that. I woke up in the morning around 7am. I felt a little &#34;off&#34; for most of the day: slightly weak, a mild headache, with some difficulty focusing. But since then I have felt normal.   I didn&#39;t seek medical attention or take any medication. I have experienced Vasovagel Syncope as a child so I expect that I am more susceptible to fainting like in this case.

                                                4 days after the first shot I was feeling very very dizzy.   My ears felt full enough that I thought maybe they were just full of wax.  I bought an over the counter ear cleaning kit.  That didn&#39;t relieve any symptoms.  I never get headaches, but a couple days later the front top of my head was throbbing.  The area just above my forehead.  It was not sinus pressure, my face didn&#39;t feel any pressure or pain.  My throat also felt like I was being slightly choked.  Not my airway, but just my jugulars.  It began in the evenings.  It would feel like I had been hanging upside down for a while.  My head felt full of blood, like it was going to pop, like my eyes were bugging out.  By a week to 10 days later, my upper arms felt weak, my toes were tingling, and my heart would flutter for just a few seconds occasionally.  I was still dizzy, still felt like I was choking, except I was feeling this way all the time now.  The symptoms only seemed to be staying the same or getting worse.  I have NEVER gone to the doctor on my own in my life to get something checked, but this had me disconcerted enough to check in and see if I should get my second shot at all.  My appointment was to see my doctor was the morning of the same day I was scheduled to get my second Pfizer shot.  My doctor had not heard of these symptoms being associated with the Pfizer shot and chalked my symptoms up to stress.  I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of &#34;waiting to see what happens&#34; if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.  But I accepted the explanation and took the second shot that day anyway.  It should be noted that the second shot made my left armpit swell up quite a bit.  I did feel dizzy again, but not nearly as much.  The other symptoms seemed to not be as bad either.

                                                INITIALLY presented to ER 5/2 with generalized fatigues,body aches,and subjective fevers after receiving his 2nd dose of Pfizer Vaccine against CoVID-19 on 4/28/21. Patient reports dizzy spells over the past few days with shortness of breath and then last evening developed a diffuse rash over his chest and extremities associated with itching and burning sensation on 5/1 evening. He denies any nausea,vomiting,abdominal pain,diarrhea.No chest pain or cough.Denies headaches.Denies h/o of prior allergic reaction/concerns to the first dose of the vaccine or any other vaccine.Denies any new exposure other than as stated the 2nd dose of the covid vaccine. Treated with IV steroids, IV Pepcid, and IV Benadryl with improvement. Upon discharge, directed to continue Prednsione 40mg daily for three more days for a total of five days of steroids, and follow-up with PCP. SUBSEQUENTLY, returned to ER  acute onset of decreased visual acuity, diffuse arthralgias, joint pain, myalgias, lightheadedness, palpitations, vertigo, muscle spasms, and difficulty moving both upper extremities. This was accompanied by sharp, 10 out of 10, nonradiating, diffuse anterior chest pressure. Nothing made this better or worse. The patient was driving at that time, and was unable to control his arms, which resulted in his vehicle leaving the roadway.  He was able to bring the vehicle to a stop before crashing. Since then, his symptoms have gradually improved, although they have not completely resolved. The characteristics are identical to the events that led to his previous admission.

He&#39;s said rest has helped ease it some, but the symptoms have not dissipated within the &#34;normal&#34; time. There have not been any extreme side effects.

Vaccine was administered into LT deltoid and pt stated that he is known to pass out after vaccines. I advised pt to stay in clinic for 15 mins or more if needed and pt agreed, and I also gave him 2 small bottles of water and highly advised him to drink them while he waited the 15 mins. I asked pt if he wanted to sit in our exam room but declined and stated that he would sit outside in our waiting area. After 5 mins (around 6:25pm), customer came and told us that someone was laying on the floor. Patient was found on other side of wall divider on the LT hand side of our waiting area laying on the LT side of his face and on his stomach. Pt aroused immediately to tactile stimulation and me calling his name. He was oriented X4 and stated that he was okay but wanted to lay on the cool floor for a moment. Pt was cool and clammy to touch and skin color pale pink. No hematomas or lacerations noted to face or head. No seizure activity noted. Stayed on floor for approx 3-4 mins and myself and another person stayed with him. There were 2 other patients present in the waiting room at the time, and the pharmD, also responded to make sure that we did not need any more help. After 3-4 mins of pt resting on floor, he agreed to get up and go into exam room 2 to lay on exam table. Patient said that he knew he was going to pass out because he heard ringing in his ears so he sat on the floor. He said the next thing he knew, I was calling his name and he was laying on the floor.

My heart was racing and I was so weak that I could barely sit up. The following day I could not get out of bed. I also had an intense headache, which is unusual for me since I never get headaches. On the 3rd day I developed dizziness/vertigo. Since those events occurred, I&#39;ve been dizzy 24/7 and had about 25-50% of my normal energy. I cannot drive, I cannot work, I cannot many of my normal daily activities. This has been devastating. It has been over 3 weeks now with these symptoms, and I will probably lose my job this week. I don&#39;t know where to turn. There should have been a safety net for these things.

Patient arrived alert and oriented x3, answered &#34;no&#34; to all screening questions, and revealed to nurse that he had a fear of needles. Nurse then offered to vaccinate patient in the zero gravity chair, patient refused stating that it would be embarassing. Patient also stated if he looked away from the needle, he would be fine. Patient received the vaccine in his left arm, nurse directed patient to sit in the front of the observation area by the EMT table, patient agreed. Patient was alert and oriented when leaving vaccine station #3. When patient made his way to the front of the EMT station to have a seat, he ended up falling at 1459. It is unclear if he loss consciousness and then fell or fell then loss consciousness. Lead RN was then alerted at 1500 by the lead ancillary, , who I ) instructed to call EMS. The recorded time of the EMS phone call is 1501. While waiting for EMS, I  attempted to rouse patient by calling his name and rubbing his sternum for several minutes and obtained a set of vitals. Vitals are as followed: BP: 119/76, O2: 100%, P: 59 taken at 1502. Patient exhibited eye movements when name was called repetitively and then patient opened his eyes at 1504 stating &#34;Somebody just hit me&#34;, while attempting to gesture to the juncture where his neck met his skull. While patient was alert, he was oriented x1. Patient could not remember where he was, what had happened, or what day it was. Patient only remembered first and last name but could not remember his age. While speaking to patient, patient loss consciouness for a second time at 1505. Another set of vitals were obtained at 1506, BP: 104/80. After getting a reading of the blood pressure, patient suddently roused at 1508 and began erratically moving his arms and legs, attempting to stand while yelling out &#34;Somebody just hit me! Get off me! Who are you?!&#34; Patient insisted on getting up, RN  and I  assisted patient to transfer into the zero-gravity chair. EMS arrived at 1510 and assumed care of patient. Patient was continually yelling during EMS assessment. EMS left with patient at 1515, hospital ER unknown.

                                                1) Heart Palpitations.  I developed episodes of prolonged heart palpitations 12 days after my second Pfizer shot.   Sometimes I have an irregular heartbeat (80 BPM); sometimes I have a racing sinus heartbeat (120-130 BPM).  My normal resting heart rate is slightly below 60 BPM.  The palpitation episodes occur 2-3 times/week, and last from 2 minutes to 2 hours.    I contracted Covid-19 in March 2020 and had mild cold-like symptoms that lingered for around 6 weeks.  In June 2020, I began to experience the palpitation symptoms I am feeling now.  My symptoms subsided and disappeared from December through April of this year.    I am undergoing tests to determine what is causing my palpitations.  EKG and Echocardiogram came back normal.  I wear an Apple Watch that has confirmed Possible AFib / High Heart Rate during my episodes of Palpitations, using the ECG feature.  2) Migraine Headaches.  3 days after the second Pfizer shot, I began experiencing daily headaches on the left side of my head.  The headaches typically begin around the mastoid area, but alternate in other areas including above my left eye, left temple, left sinus, and back of head.  The headaches come and go, and are varying severity, but I&#39;ve had some form of headache on same side of head every day since April 8, three days after my second shot.

                                                I woke up before normal time to go to the bathroom at about 5:00AM. Part of the way through urination, I started experiencing dizziness, which didn&#39;t feel abnormal for having got out of bed/upright quickly. By the end of urination, the dizziness had come to an uncomfortable level, and faintness began to set in. I leaned on the sink to hold my body up, before trying to return to bed. I blacked out (probably very briefly) and resumed consciousness when my face hit the bathroom  door as I fell. I was almost immediately fully aware of my surroundings and what had happened after I resumed consciousness. Although I felt no further symptoms, I remained on the floor on my back for 3-5 mins before getting up and back to bed. Other than soreness at the injection site, which is gone this morning (May 15), no additional symptoms returned.

                                                On  04/26/2021 felt short breathlessness and dizziness. also Blood pressure is elevated and in between 150-160. Heart rate was also high. Immediately went to ER to check. Was treated for palpitation and dehydration. Felt normal after couple of days.  I took second dose on 05/06/2021. I felt normal for about a week. After that i started feeling heavy or pressure in my head and also dizziness. For past one week I&#39;m feeling acid reflux and heartburn. Considering i had history of acid reflux I never had this issue for past few years. I&#39;m not sure if my GERD issues are induced by vaccine. I&#39;m having controlled diet with fruits and veggies but i still have  heartburn and frequent burps. Also my Blood Pressure is still elevated around 130-140 and feeling tired and pressure in my head even now after  18 days of taking 2nd dose. I had consulted my physician on 05/20/2021, and she prescribed a medicine to take only when my blood pressure is above 140.   Just to summarize, I still have dizziness and occasionally elevated BP and acid reflux, heartburn/burps. This is impacting my day to day home and office works

I had heart pains, and took a shower and had a heart rate of 130. I took Ativan and felt some better. I thought about going to the ER, but I emailed my doctor instead. He told me to rest. Dr. suggested I go to the ER if I felt worse. I did feel some better after hearing from him. He said he was not to concerned about it, he didn&#39;t think it was my heart. He said after I had Covid and the vaccine he wasn&#39;t surprised.

                                                At approximately 6pm I experienced chest tightening and pain above my heart.  When taking deep breaths the pain became more sharp.  The pain lasted about 3 days, gradually decreasing each day.  At the time I attributed it to stress, as the day and recently I have experienced stress at work.  I did not seek medical attention as it improved over time, and has not returned.  I decided to report when hearing about the heart inflammation reports, and this was about 1.5 weeks after my 2nd dose.  Symptoms do overlap with stress (what I originally attributed to) and what I have read are symptoms of hear inflammation.  My adverse events that followed my 2nd vaccine (minor fever, aches, headaches, swollen lymph nodes, etc) only onset about 20 hours post vaccine, and lingered longer than most people that I know.

Did not recognize the connection to the vaccine at the time and got the second dose. Symptoms worsened and on 4/12/21 felt extreme chest pressure like lead bar in center of chest. Pain and pressure have lessened in intensity since that time but has not gone away. Chest pain and/or  pressure has been present ever day for over 3 months now. During this time, I have also been experiencing consistent rapid and shallow breathing but without the experience of shortness of breath.

I don&#39;t know if this is attributed to the vaccine or not but it was suggested that I report this based on phone call I received today from a person working with control I believe.

                                                I felt dizzy at 12 PM on the 17th of June 2021. Then at 1 pm I started to feel dizzy and then my heart rate increased so I dialed 911. I then started to lose feeling in my left hand. Then when the ambulance picked me up, my right hand started to go numb. The doctors at emergency think its possibly anxiety and I had a panic attack. I am taking anxiety meds for the anxiety but I am still having heart palpitations.

                                                Dry mouth and sweats; Sweat; Heart rate elevated to around 133/135 bpm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 36-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 17Mar2021 at 16:45 (at the age of 36-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 Immunisation. The patient was allergic to vancomycin and no other medical history was reported. The patient received fish oil (MANUFACTURE UNKNOWN), vitamin D (MANUFACTURE UNKNOWN), vitamin B-12 (MANUFACTURE UNKNOWN) and NUTRAFOL within 2 weeks of vaccination as concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccine 4 weeks prior to the covid vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19. On 17Mar2021 at 16:45, the patients heart rate elevated to around 133/135 beats per minute (bpm), dry mouth and sweats followed. Symptoms lasted around 30 minutes. Roughly 60 minutes after vaccine was administered, heart rate gradually decreased to around 100 bpm (with the help of breathing exercises). Another 20-30 minutes later, heart rate fell to around 84 bpm. The rest of the evening/night, heart rate steadied in the 70s. It was reported that normal heart rate while awake (between 62 and 65 bpm) followed the next day. The events did not result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient did not receive any treatment for the reported events. The clinical outcome of dry mouth, sweats, heart rate elevated were recovered on 17Mar2021.   Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information expected.

                                                About 2 weeks after getting my first Pfizer shot, I woke up with burning left-sided substernal chest pain that persisted for hours.  When I went to get up to use the bathroom that night, I passed out.  For the next 1-2 months, I had exertional left-sided chest pain that then resolved spontaneously.  I&#39;m a 37-year-old male (was 36 at the time of symptoms), thin (BMI 23), exercise regularly, and take just one medication (the lowest dose of atorvastatin for mild dyslipidemia).  At the time I had these symptoms, the phenomenon of myocarditis after the Pfizer vaccine had not been widely reported, so it never occurred to me that my symptoms could have been due to this.  So I ended up receiving the second Pfizer vaccine about 3 weeks after the first dose.  My symptoms after the second dose were similar to others around me (24 hours of severe myalgias/chills/weakness followed by several days of not feeling like myself).   Now (6 months later), I feel essentially back to normal.

First couple of days were fine, but starting  26-FEB-2021, I&#39;ve been exhibiting all of the following: Fever - Friday 98, Saturday (3 measures over 5 hours) 99.1, 99.3, 99.4, Sunday 98.5, Monday 99.4 (at night, work up in body aches), Tuesday(97.5), Wednesday 98.5 Chills - mild, 1-3 times. comes and goes through past week.  Occurs more at night.  Feeling cold - wearing sweat pants, two shirts, long sleeve shirt, sweater, during sleep.  Constantly add/remove clothes to regulate temperature. During day, have sweat pants &#43; sweater on 78&#43; degree weather. Muscle pain - in back, moving daily. First started in right chest and back right shoulder, has now disappeared.  Now in middle of back, around spin area, hard and uncomfortable to sleep, taking IB profin helps alleviate pain, 2 to 3 tables over counter.  pain in throat around vocal box, could be due to sneezing, slight soreness to touch/aches. Feeling unwell - comes and goes, day starts fine, then around noon/1pm i get super tired and sleep.  Sleeping schedule is generally 10PM to 6AM &#43; naps through day Lose stools - from 25-FEB to 27-FEB, cleared up on 29-FEB Coughing - started on 03-MAR-2021, slight about 1 to 3 times an hour. Headache - comes and goes, use IB profin only when trying to sleep, all other times i let it be.  Good news: No swelling at injection site No redness at injection site  No Swelling at injection site  Final notes: Just feeling up an down, not taking anything besides IB profin for pain management. I was going to work everyday pre-shot with out issue. Post-shot, not feeling well enough to report to work out of fear of spreading anything that i got. Weekend immune system. Slightly grumpy demeanure since sick and interrupted sleep patterns.

                                                I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at about 4:05 or 4:10 PM today (Wed, Mar 3, 2021). Right away I had the following symptoms briefly: chills and blurred vision. Around 4:20 or so I left in my vehicle. Shortly after, I had a few chills. I needed to use the restroom and pulled into a gas station. After starting to go the bathroom, I quickly began to feel warm and my vision began to blur. The next thing I knew, I opened my eyes laying on the bathroom floor. I then left the restroom and headed to my vehicle where I noticed I had perspiration on my forehead and was really warm.  Over the next hour or so I experienced chills frequently. They have since subsided.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

I ended up with fever of 102 by 11:00 or midnight; chills and burning up and what prompted me to call my doctor, in the middle of the night, I have a watch with heart rate monitoring and it had woken me up with signal of abnormal heartrate. It was over 130 (normal rate is between 55 and 60 during sleep ) and I had a telemed visit and Dr. said to take Ibuprofen after 24 hour mark. The only other side affect, my bladder side was feeling small and I had to pee every hour. Ibuprofen helped break the fever. The symptoms were resolved by about the following night. My stress level measured by my watch was back in the normal range after I woke up the second morning.

                                                Well I?m alive. It started about 45 minutes after taking the vaccine. It began as heavy salivating and turned into a numb tongue. I have never had an allergic reaction, so didn?t pay much attention to it. After returning home I became severely lightheaded and almost passed out. I immediately took a Benadryl and Motrin. Then my heart rate shot up to 160BPM according to my smart watch and maintained that for around 5 minutes. The home medicine helped it to subside, but the same feelings would return in moderate waves. By 2pm, I decided I should seek professional help and was taken to the ER by a family member. By this time I had moderate chest and jaw was very tight. At the ER I was monitored for 1 hour and then given an IV injection of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron(steroid). I immediately get relived and well. I was released from the ER around an hour later and sent home with a prescription of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone Oral Steroid. I have since had a few different side effects like chest pain, extremely flushed face, and low grade fevers. The medicine taken at home immediately stopped the face flushing.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EL9267) on 26Feb2021 and the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EN6202) on 12Mar2021, via an unspecified route of administration on Left Arm at single  dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The administration of first dose of BNT162B2 resulted in Palpitations, dizziness, hyperhidrosis and Syncope the same day of administration. Relevant medical history included allergy to penicillin.  Relevant concomitant medications included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE). During second dose of vaccine the patient stated that he feels the medicine in his body, almost to his toes. The patient was fine for a minute or two but then he reported a big rush of the room spinning, struggling to catch my breath, racing heart. EMS personnel was called over and they monitored my heart rate. It was swinging from 120&#43; BPM to 50 BPM in an instant and during the low BPM was when he passed out.   The patient was treated with Epinephrine due a potential reaction and transported to hospital.  The reported events were feeling abnormal, vertigo, dyspnoea, palpitations, heart rate irregular and loss of consciousness. All events were serious as hospitalization and Life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).

At approx. 11:10am (40 minutes after injection) I started to feel tightness in my chest and developed moderate wheezing. I immediately took two puffs of my albuterol sulfate HFA inhaler. The wheezing stopped after I used the inhaler. I did not need to use my epi injector but it was definitely anaphylaxis based on prior experience. I did not report this to the vaccination site as I had already left. It is now 12:45pm and I feel fine.

He told us he has not had any breakfast that day. he said he normally feels light headed after a vaccine but not to the extent of passing out. He was given soda and water for fear of low blood sugar. he was partially responsive and communicative but diaphoretic . 911 came in to assess him but since he was getting better he refused to go to the hospital with them

                                                I developed  a bloody nose after both vaccine injections.  The first vaccine I received was on 3/4/21 and had a bloody nose in my left nostril around 3-4 hours after the injection.  It seemed odd as I do not typically have bloody noses.  When I got  my second dose today I received another bloody nose roughly 30 minutes after the vaccine.   Both times the bloody nose happened after lightly blowing my nose.  Again, I very rarely suffer bloody noses.  I currently am not bleeding anywhere else and the nose bleeds stopped after about 10 minutes.

I ran over to pt and he was losing consciousness. His eyes rolled back in his head and he began to fall to the ground. Pt lost consciousness. 911 was called.  Pharmacist administered EPIPEN immediately in thigh. He responded immediately and regained consciousness. Within a few minutes, he was able to say his name and respond to questions etc. 911 arrived and assessed pt. He did not go to ER and stayed another 20 minutes until he felt okay to leave with his girlfriend.

                                                I received my second shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, March 20th at noon.  Saturday at midnight, I woke up in full body sweats and aches.  I took two ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep, but I would toss and turn in full body sweats and aches for the next 8 hours.  I took another 2 ibuprofen around 400am.  Sunday morning I woke up feeling OK, not great, but OK.  Sunday night ? it was very strange ? the full body chills and aches came back.  Not as bad as Saturday night, but they returned nevertheless.  I had another restless night of sleep, and I took another two rounds of ibuprofen to try and help me sleep.  Monday I woke up feeling OK again.  Monday evening, around 8:00pm, I could feel the full body chills and aches coming back again, creeping up slightly.  This time, I also felt a mild burning in my upper chest and throat.  I went to bed around 8:00pm, then woke up at 9:00pm, this time in a lot of pain.  It felt like burning and a stabbing sensation in my throat and upper chest.  I took some ibuprofen, and tried to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned in agony for the next few hours, apparently falling asleep at some point around 1:00am.  At 2:00am I woke up in severe pain again.  It was very bad, like an 8 out of a 10.  It felt like a burning and stabbing sensation in my lower throat and upper chest.  I had my wife call 911, and I was brought to hospital in an ambulance.  I would stay in the hospital for the next 3 days, getting discharged Thursday at around 5:00pm.  I had peak troponin levels of 5, so I basically had a moderate heart attack.  I had a cardiac catherization procedure done, as well as a cardiac MRI.  The cardiac catherization procedure showed I had no blockages at all in my arteries.  The cardiologists diagnosed me with myocarditis.  The cardiologists told me they believe the vaccine triggered a heavy response from my auto immune system.  The response from my auto immune system in turn caused my heart to become inflamed, giving me myocarditis.  It was a horrible experience, and my doctors are convinced that it was brought on by the second coronavirus vaccine shot that I received.

He appeared to be unconscious for 5-10 seconds and then came to. While he was confused for a few minutes, he was able to orient himself to place, time, and date. No treatment was administered. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was monitored throughout recovery time.

ER staff were unable to determine the cause of the pain. Exactly one week after the shot (Tuesday), I start sweating profusely and nearly passing out at work. A day later (Wednesday), my heart rate went through the roof and I was dizzy, out of breath. By Friday night I was in an urgent care clinic with a resting heart rate of 145BPM. (My normal is in the 50s). I was diagnosed with Arterial Fibrillation. I have no history, or family history of heart issues. I run 3-5 days a week....3-10 miles at a time. In the military...very healthy.

Within 5-6 minutes of leaving the room, pt presented with pallor, sweating, dizziness, light-headedness.  We gave him a bottle of cold water to drink and a cold rag and an ice pack to use on his neck. We checked in with him every 3-4 minutes to make sure he was still doing ok and starting to feel better. After about 15-20 minutes, the color began to come back in his face and the sweating and dizziness subsided. He contacted his wife (he has a history of this type of reaction) and she came to pick him up about 27 minutes after the administration of the vaccine.  He walked out of our store on his own without help.

Had to diarrhea over 30 times in one day, throw up several times. Went to emergency room for treatment. IV treatment plus anti naseau and anti cramping   Medication. Cramping was severe in upper intestine. Symptoms have decreased, but still linger after 2 weeks of 2nd shot.  Concern if side effects are permeant. I still very tired/fatigued,  have cramping, dirahaha, throwing up, aches muscles and joints- not feeling like myself and regret taking the vaccine if it results in lifelong side effects.

                                                After having experienced the typical side effects associated with the COVID vaccine I had a gradual onset of crippling pain on the right side of my chest. Pain became so intense that I became nauseous and felt that I had to throw up. Instead of throwing up I actually passed out (syncope) for about 30 seconds. Chest pain remained, but gradually lessened over the following 30-45 minutes while laying stool on the ground on my right side. I was transported to the hospital. Numerous EKG?s and blood draws were taken which did not reveal I had suffered a cardiac event. I spoke with several doctors and nobody could conclude the cause for the intense chest pain.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm, at the age of 37 years, on Apr2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included brain tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. On 09Apr2021, the patient stated, &#34;I am undergoing immunotherapy treatment for a brain tumor. My doctors recommended I take the vaccine 2 weeks following my most recent treatment (administered every 4 weeks). Several hours after receiving the vaccine, the right side of my body was very weak and my balance was off. These symptoms went away by the next morning. 5 days later they came back and progressed. Ultimately, I went to the emergency room having trouble walking, using my right arm and staying balanced. All tests (MRIs, ultrasound, CT scan, extensive bloodwork, and more) proved that there were no apparent causes. Ultimately, it was concluded that I had a stroke and the vaccine was likely the main contributor. I am 37, in shape, and eat extremely well.&#34;  The patient was hospitalized for the events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: there were no apparent causes, computerised tomogram: there were no apparent causes, magnetic resonance imaging: there were no apparent causes, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 15Apr2021 and ultrasound scan: there were no apparent causes on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures (Aspirin prescription, Castor, physical therapy) were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

Medical history included drug penicillin allergies and low testosterone ongoing since 2018. Concomitant medication included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE) for low testosterone, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin but had allergies. The patient reported that a few minutes after his first vaccination (19Feb2021), he experienced a racing heart, dizziness, sweating, and almost felt like fainting.

A few minutes went suddenly, he became very dizzy or short of breath, EMS was on standby at this site, so they advised him to sit on the floor. They connected heart /02 monitor to him (2021), and his heart rate was very highly (around 130 BPM) or then it would swing widely to less than 50 BPM. During these swings, he would get very dizzy or faint. This happened multiple times starting from less severe to severe with fainting, to finally going away, unfortunately after 30 minutes or so when the heart rate swings were observed, EMS administered Epinephrine and Benadryl in IV form.

                                                Vaccine Adverse Event Report  May 8th, 2021. Patient, had an appointment for his 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine May 8th 2021 at 10:00am. His first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 was at our Pharmacy on April 16th, 2021. At around 10:15am, patient came in with his fiancé, who is a doctor at pediatric department, shown on her name tag. After processing the paperwork needed for vaccination, Pharmacist on duty, went over the VAR to ensure the provided information was adequate before it was ready for my intern to administer the shot. Patient looked fine as I was able to have a brief conversation with him while waiting for the shot. Due to some insurance issues that needed to be resolved, at 10:40am, pharmacy intern, took the patient to Patient Health Room for immunization. At 10:45am, I was ringing up a prescription at Terminal 42 when hearing the word, Help, coming from the Patient Health Room. Within seconds later, the door was opened as I was running out the pharmacy toward the Patient Health Room to see what happened. The patient was lying on the floor, unconscious, while his fiancé was calling his name asking whether he was okay and rolled him to his side and supported his head. I reached into the cabinet and prepared to administer an EPIPEN to the patient, meanwhile, pharmacy technicians, asked and dialed 911. As his fiancé kept calling his name, the patient gained consciousness. I asked intern what had happened to clarify whether it was a reaction due to the vaccination or not. Meanwhile, the patient&#39;s fiancé stated this event was not unexpected. Patient was able to talk and confirmed he was fine. Unfortunately, it appeared that the patient bruised his nose and forehead with slight blood from a minor cut. We instructed the patient and his fiancé to stay in the room and offered assistance upon request until EMS arrived. Patient&#39;s fiancé requested an ice pack for his bruise. Later on, the patient appeared to be shaking, so I asked the fiancé whether it was okay to give him some GATORADE. His fiancé also requested a glucose meter to check his blood sugar. The EMS arrived within minutes and patient was transported to hospital Before they were leaving, I asked the fiancé if there was anything she would like us to do as well as offered a follow-up. She declined the offer. I also asked briefly if she could share his medical condition, but the fiancé only disclosed that the patient has needle anxiety. The EMS also said that they will take it from here, and there is no additional action needed from our end at this time. Each team members who were involved in the event wrote reports and kept them filed in the pharmacy records.

This 37- year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number: EW0171), via an unspecified route of administration, on 20Apr2021 (at the age of 37-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Patient has no relevant medical history or concomitant medications. He got the 1st dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine yesterday around 12, and had &#34;normal swelling and stuff like that, nothing major but today from the morning, blood is coming from the mouth continuously and I can taste the blood like as if the sensation that you get in your mouth when you have a blood in your mouth and usually when I spit I found it a bit more and sometimes a bit less but it is there, every time I spit, it was once I got from the nose but from the mouth I am not sure what is the source of that bleeding, is it gums or coming out from where I do not know.&#34;  No treatment was received. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

                                                On the day after taking the second dose of Pfizer vaccine shot, I experienced a sharp chest pain and tightness soon after waking up.  However, the pain symptom went away quickly, but my chest muscle has remained tight since then.  The chest muscle between the front of my heart and the back at the point underneath the left scapula has remained tight, seemingly protecting my heart from being burned.  Overall, the chest pain and tightness symptoms are considerably mild, and my chest tightness condition has gradually improved.

Some brain fog/forgetfullness. Lack of motivation. Irritability some days. Headaches - some days really bad, other days none. Chest pains come/go throughout day. Was getting winded walking up 3 stairs but that has been slightly better. Some days - extensive muscle pain. Especially in lower back &amp; left hip area. Some days - whole body aches. Chills - feels like body temp is off. Things come in waves - numbness/tingliness is pretty much all the time though. Also, insomnia. Did start to take 1.25mg of melatonin as needed but still very fatigued.  5/19 - Stared acupuncture (plan is 2x a week) Around 5/21 - developed rash. Face (R&amp;L side), neck/jaw area (L), inner thigh (L). Doesn&#39;t itch all the time but when it does, it really itches. Has continued 5/22 &amp; 5/23 - headaches worsened 5/22 &amp; 5/23 - developed diarrhea 5/23 - more tingliness developed midshin to right foot and more in right arm.  5/25 - joints began to hurt more - especially in elbow area  Lung dr.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, May 18, 2021 at 1:53pm EDT. Many of the &#34;typical&#34; or &#34;expected&#34; side effects commenced about 12 hours later, including chills, night sweats, a slight fever (99.5), and headache and lethargy the following day.   Nothing was particularly off-putting until the afternoon of Wednesday, May 19, 2021, when I noticed small red spots on my legs and feet. A Google search suggested petechiae and enough cause for me to go to a nearby urgent care clinic. The petechiae were present on both legs and feet (and eventually a few spots on my hands), though a little more pronounced on the left side (with one noteworthy cluster on my left leg). I had no apparent gum bleeding or bruising (maybe one bruise, but the urgent care doctor thought it was there beforehand).  The doctor at the urgent care clinic confirmed petechiae and ran stat blood work for return that night. At ~9pm EDT on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, I received a phone call from the urgent care&#39;s centralized lab informing me that my platelet count was 2 (10^3/uL) -- dangerously low, with risk of spontaneous bleeding and in the worst case scenario brain hemorrhage -- and my PTT was 55.6 seconds. They told me to report to an emergency room immediately, the nearest of Medical Center.  The diagnosis was eventually Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). Every physician I&#39;ve encountered has felt that the occurrence one-day post-vaccination points to the vaccine as the cause. (For what it&#39;s worth, I do not think any of the doctors or nurses I encountered had never seen a platelet count so low. Most of them said as much.) My discharge papers officially note as the diagnoses: petechiae, thrombocytopenia, and adverse effect of vaccine.  I have included details related to my platelet count, treatment course, and other figures below (and am happy to provide corroborating information where appropriate). The doctors did not run any d-dimers, PF4 HIT ELISA, or fibrinogen tests, and no imaging was performed, presumably because I did not present with any signs of simultaneous clotting (e.g., TTP or VITT). They&#39;ve also told me that my haptoglobin and hemoglobin levels were normal (see below), which I am told helps support the notion that there was / is no clotting or &#34;red blood cell breakdown.&#34;  Search terms: decreased platelet count, immune thrombocytopenia, ITP, severely low platelet count, low platelets, petechiae, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia, vaccine-induced ITP

                                                He got his vaccine, and was okay.  The next day was tired, drowsiness and missed a day of work, and was able to work after that.  He        was supposed to get his 2nd vaccine on 5/21/21 and had to go out of town and was going to get it when he got back.  The next day 5/23/21 at 12:00 AM his throat began to swell up and gradually it moved from his throat to his chest area.  He went to the ER on 5/23/21 in Hospital and they looked at his throat, gave him a steroid shot and some antibiotics and sent him home.  The next morning he drove back to home and continued taking the antibiotics that they prescribed and his throat kept swelling more and more.  On Tuesday 5/25 at 1:00 PM he went to the ER and sat there 8 hours without being seen and decided to leave.  The next morning 5/26/21 he went to an UC and they sent him to an ER at Hospital and from there he was sent to another ER by ambulance to have emergency throat surgery.  He had surgery on  5/27/21 at the Hospital where he had an abscess on the inside of his throat that caused his throat to swell.  He had swollen lymph nodes and to release the pressure and fluid in his throat as his neck and chest were swelled up.   He was discharged on 5/31/21.  He is now recovering from the surgery and getting better.  He lost 30# as he was not able to eat and did not have an appetite until he came home and eating a little bit better now.   He goes back to his doctor on 6/15/21 to get the stitches removed from his neck.

He woke up his mother at 5:40, came to his mothers room and said that he was shaking, and mother noticed that he was, trembling.  She asked what was wrong and he said that he could not stop shaking and his chest was hurting.  She set him down in a chair and she got the autometer to check his BP and oxygen, and his BP was 134/98, and his 02 was 96, heart rate 86.  She felt him to see if he was having a fever, it was 98.4.  She told him to sit for a little while and waited about 10 minutes, she checked his BP again at 6:00 AM, and it was 139/102, he said that he was feeling really dizzy, his head started hurting real bad.  He said that he had a bad taste in his mouth.  She just monitored him, and his 02 was still 96, heart rate was still good.  He stayed in her room until 6:15 and she got up and told him if he got worse she would take him to the ER.  At 6:25 she gave him two 500 mg of Tylenol tablets and sat him in a recliner.  At 7:30 his head was still hurting, but he was not shaking, and she gave him some yogurt and water.  He stated that he started feeling better and around 7:40 he went back up to his room and went back to sleep.  He has been ok since then.

I received my second shot on Feb 23, 2021 and had a headache/ minor migraine two days later. By the next day I was alright. On approximately May 4, 2021 (I can&#39;t recall the exact date) I briefly experienced light pain in my chest while using an under-desk elliptical at work. I am in good shape and that has never happened before. I last had an ECG in October 2020 during a physical for my job, and there were no issues at the time. The pain lasted four about a half hour and then subsided. Exactly one week later on the afternoon of May 11, I experienced the pain again at work while sitting at my desk, but that time for approximately ten minutes. I have not experienced any further pain and never saw a  doctor concerning the pain.

                                                Around early April, about a week and a half after my second vaccine shot, I started to experience very bad pain in the left and surrounding area of my chest. I noticed my heart seemed like it was racing quickly, and while sleeping, it would wake me up at various times.  I went to ER to make sure I wasn&#39;t having a heart attack, and while my vitals appeared normal, the pain and racing continued at various times. I went to see a cardiologist as well as my PCP.  At the time, no one acknowledged that the vaccine was related to it the symptoms. As a young, healthy male, who exercises and workouts and never experienced chest pain before in my entire life. It is now June and adverse symptoms still linger.

I vomited, I believe from the pain after I tried getting on my hands and knees. Once, I realized I could only stand upright I did. Pain lasted for about an hour. Also, I chewed an aspirin but not sure if that helped. I felt fine after standing for a while and continue to feel fine more than 24 hrs later. Also, I&#39;ll add that I&#39;ve had acid reflux before and this wasn&#39;t that.

The issue i had was what felt like my heart working hard when i laid down for bed a couple nights.  One time i put a heart rate monitor one because it felt like my heart rate was very high but the monitor showed normal.

                                                My husband complained of nausea Thursday.  Then extreme nausea, body aches, sinus  headache, and cold chills Friday. Saturday, he said that he has had chest pain and tightness from the time he woke up, until the early hours of Sunday, around 1AM.  He had taken Aleve  around 8PM previously, as it is an NSAID and we  had read that that may help. We suspected myocarditis or something similar.; my husband has never reacted to vaccines before and there has been linkage between Pfizer and small amounts of persons coming down with it. We opted to treat at home first.   My husband&#39;s breathing and heart rate regulated a little after 2AM. He said it was just like when he had COVID. It hurt to breathe.

                                                I was sitting watching tv in my chair, drinking soda, 4 hours after shot when I started getting nauseous and I had to go vomit. I ended up passing out. I came out of it within a minute later and my heart was racing like crazy. I sat there, drinking cold water, and I stayed up because I was nervous to go to bed. The next day I felt fine, but I did have the usual side effects-muscle spasms and headache. A week later my chest got very tight and I started getting pain in my chest and I thought it was the muscle spasms. The next Sunday on 06/20/ 2021 I went to the urgent care because I woke up and didn&#39;t feel right. They did EKG, chest x-ray and they took blood and they got me into a cardiologist. I went to him on the 06/22/2021 and they did another EKG and it was normal and he told me that I could keep exercising (works out 5x a week). Last Friday my chest tightness was so bad when I left the gym so I went to the ER and they did another EKG and blood work and they did a cat scan and everything was normal - also an x-ray. He thinks it&#39;s inflammation of the chest wall surrounding the heart but he did not tell me it was a side effect of vaccine. I&#39;ve never had tightness in chest or issues with heart. It was really scary and I&#39;m wearing a heart monitor and just returned it today. I do have a few more appointments coming up with my PCP and cardiology. I&#39;ve been taking Advil 2-3 times a day, and I think it might be anxiety a little bit and it&#39;s messing with my head.

The heart inflammation resolved in approximately 2 weeks.  Flu like symptoms for a 8 hour period about 24 hours after my second vaccination.

During screening questions, patient mentioned after 1st dose, the next day he experienced chest tightness. It only lasted that day and then went away. He did not experience any SOB. Due to his chest tightness, I recommended talk to his PCP and obtain 2nd dose in a more controlled environment.

                                                4 days after my second vaccine of Pfizer COVID vaccine. I felt chest pain. Day 5 I went to ER for chest pains along with what felt like heart flutters, irregular heartbeat and excessive pounding. I had one of those 3 constantly happened for 10 days but ER read nothing wrong. As chest pains started to ease up I noticed I am getting constant bloating feeling, swollowing is not difficult but not easy either. Like something is lodged in my throat. Not really hungry do to all of this either. Now my heart went back to normal. After 10 days and ran through a series of test from the cardiologist. It all came back good.  I?m happy about that, I still have minimal chest pressure and bloating excessive bloating that goes with mid section of the body being achy/painful.  I have been a super healthy person all my life and as I get older I change things to better my health.  I hope all this goes away but hopefully others are reporting more like this so I can get some answers sooner rather than later before it?s bad news. Thank you for your time.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

On 12/25,   seven days after  receiving the  shot  I started to get right lower leg pain and I kept complaining about it till New Years Day. I had no symptoms of a DVT.  I triaged on 1/1/21 and the doctors  ordered  labs/imaging  and the results were  as followed: D-Dimer  biomarker  (&#43;) , Ultrasound of the Rt lower leg ( - ) ,  CTA showed a PE (segmental right upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus). I  was discharged on  Xarelto and advised to follow  up with a hematologist. On 1/5/2021,  I went to hematology and they did a whole bunch of labs. I was sent to get a  ultrasound   of the leg because the pain persist and they found  a clot hidden by my soleus. The plan is to continue on the Xarelto for 6 months. Come back in 3 weeks to scan my leg again and get my lab results.  On 1/12/2021, I received the 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccination.

Got up in the night to check on my kids, had been standing for about 2-3 minutes when symptoms started, and passed out in the hallway about 60 seconds after symptom onset.  Recovered consciousness within a few seconds, had to lay on the floor for about 5 minutes due to nausea, then got back in bed and went back to sleep.  Woke up 3 hours later and felt completely fine except a little fatigue - all other symptoms had resolved.

A 38-years-old male patient started to receive 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142, Expiry Date: 01Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 30Dec2020 18:17 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was reported as &#39;None&#39; and AEs following prior vaccinations was reported as &#39;None&#39;. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was reported as None. The patient experienced really bad chills, body aches, fever, unable to sleep on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, passed out on bathroom floor for 5-10 seconds, sweating and neck was stiff on 01Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, headache on an unspecified data with outcome of unknown.  Details were as follows: the patient received the Covi-19 vaccine 30Dec2021. He had a reaction to the vaccine. 24 hours after getting the vaccine he had really bad chills, body aches, fever 100.4. He didn&#39;t take any medication for a bit. He then took acetaminophen (TYLENOL). He had a headache, he was unable to sleep. The acetaminophen worked and he went to bed. At 5:00 am he started having a bad headache and took Ibuprofen. He woke up to go to the bathroom. He passed out for 5-10 seconds in the bathroom. His head was leaning in the wall by the door. He was sweating and was stiff all over. He went to the Emergency Room on 01Jan2021. They did an X-ray and a CT scan. They gave him 100ml of saline and some pills. They also did some lab work. Everything was negative. They assumed his body couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. He was supposed to have received the second shot yesterday (20Jan2021). Employee Health said his Primary Care Physician would have to make the decision on him taking it or not. His doctor said he would have to do more research with Pfizer before he says if he can take it or not. Emergency Room visit required due to event passing out.

The worst occurred the day after when my body could no longer absorb insulin. I increased my basal rate by almost 400% and could not bring my sugars down. Saturday afternoon I began experiencing symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis: stomach pain, vomiting, high ketones and very high  blood sugars. I was able to eventually take in enough water to lower my ketones and sugar and narrowly avoided going to the ER, but high blood sugars and headache have persisted and I am still experiencing these symptoms.

                                                While in the Observation room after his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, Patient informed me that he was having a little bit of a headache.  He inquired about having his blood pressure taken.  His blood pressure at this time was 193/111.  I gave him some water and discussed next steps.  He agreed to remain in the Observation room to see if the water helped, and if trying to relax would help his symtoms.  Patient has a history of high blood pressure.  After an additional 30 minutes of observation, his blood pressure was taken again and this time it was 199/127.  At this time, he agreed to be seen in the ER for an assessment by the ER physcian.  At this time, his care was turned over to the ER staff.

I was initially able to walk from the area where the injection was administered about 50 yards to the observation area. Sat down &amp; shortly thereafter could feel myself getting woozy. I laid my head back &amp; closed my eyes hoping to avoid it. I was given two epinephrine shots the second of which woke me up. Several medical staff were around me when I opened my eyes. I was taken to the patient wing and checked into my own room for observation for a few more hours. Blood was drawn and sent off for a Triptase test which came back negative a couple days later. After being kept under observation for a few hours I was release around noon. I have a history of problems with shots/needles. Haven&#39;t actually passed out from it in over 20 years, but it is a known problem.

                                                Patient received his pfzier covid vaccine.  immediately after he had the vaccine administered, he stated that he started to feel very hot, dizzy, nausea and tingling down his arm that he received the vaccine in.  We immediately got a yoga mat, asked the patient to remove his shirt.  He fell to the ground.  We placed a cold pack under his head around the neck area and cold paper towels on his head.  We took his blood pressure it was 136/88.  He started to mention his chest hurting.  His past medical history includes fainting in the past (due to low blood sugars) and open heart surgery as a child.  He is currently under the care of a cardiologist.  More recently he has had several fainting spells which he believes is due to low blood sugar.  He stated he had eaten a good lunch around 11:30.  It was about 2:30 when this incident occurred.  We offered the patient, a banana, orange, chicken sandwich and water.  He ate the orange.  We called EMS.  When they arrived, they checked his blood sugar which it was 95.  He started to feel better and his wife drove him to the cardiologist.

For about 3 to 4 days he had a faster heart rate and higher blood pressure than normal.   He developed a headache that lasted about 2 days.  Currently he is having some brain fog  and his shoulder and biceps still have a heavy feeling like they are detached from his body along with the muscle twitching and tingling.  He does not feel like these symptoms are improving and will see his PCP on 3/29/2021.

So much so that I pulled over my car on the side of the road, used my inhaler that I very rarely use.  I also went to a store to get some caffeine, thinking it may help with my dizziness.  I was going to call the nurse line, but started getting better about an hour later.     My allergist has advised me not to get the 2nd shot.

                                                Hey guys, just a heads up if you know anyone with a CPAP machine who just received a second dose of the vaccine.   I received the shot on Friday.  No reaction all day.  No reaction all day Saturday.  Saturday/Sunday night I started vomiting into my CPAP mask/machine while still asleep. I wouldn?t have woken up unless my wife was there to hear me choking. She cleaned out my mask and had me lay on my side all night while monitoring me.  Scary stuff. Just thought you should make your friends with apnea aware. I still don?t remember the incident at all. I have a mild fever right now, 99.8. I used to tell my wife she saved my life, but now I don&#39;t mean it figuratively. UPDATE: I forgot to mention that I passed out Saturday night.  I was standing in the kitchen and the next thing I knew I was on the ground.

                                                10:00PM Saturday, 4/17/21 Sudden chest pain. Tried to sleep it off, pain lingered all day Sunday 4/18/21. 8:00PM went to local ER with same chest pain, had not gotten better. ER took blood draw, my troponin was 4.6 and doctors thought it was an error since I am 38 years old and otherwise health with no history of chest pain or family history of heat trouble. Second blood draw showed troponin at 5.0 getting worse. They called an ambulance and took me to the hospital nearby. Third blood draw showed 6.0 and I spiked at 10.0 overnight. I had several EKGs, a CT scan, and an angiogram. None of these showed any obstructions or blockages in the heart or blood vessels that could have caused the heart trauma. I had an echocardiogram which showed that my heart is only pumping at 50% which is low for a healthy young person who is a runner. I was diagnosed with myocarditis and with having had a Non-ST Segment Elevation Heart Attack. Again, I have no family history of this, I am otherwise healthy, I do not use drugs and I did not have any trauma to my chest, such as a car accident, that could have caused this. The only explanation is that it was related to the COVID shot, which I had roughly 48 hours before my sudden chest pain

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.

On 15Apr2021, the patient experienced pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction and patient was hospitalized for 1 day. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care and Hospitalization. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination and medications within two weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 15Apr2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction which included anticoagulation. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

                                                Ten minutes after receiving my 1st dose I passed out and hit my head on the floor! Causing multiple bruises on my face and head! I was unconscious for 30 seconds, and while unconscious my eyes started to role to the back of my head. When I became alert I was on the floor and I couldn?t breathe! While on the floor gasping for air I vomited twice! 911 was called and an EKG was done on site! It showed that my heart rate was low, and I was transported to hospital ER department. Multiple test were done on me and everything came back perfect! No high blood pressure, not a diabetic, and no Permanent head damage.

                                                About 5 minutes after the injection I get a tingling feeling all over my body.  That quickly subsides. Then my heart rate jumps from 75 to 140. My face goes flush and I feel like I am going to pass out. This happened on the first shot so I purchased a blood oximeter for my second and watched it closely. My blood oxygen never went below 96 and mostly remained at 98.  Once my pulse hit 140 it immediately began to fall back to 75. About the time the nurse I alerted got there is was back to normal. I do not feel sick at all after either shot. Sure wish I knew what this reaction I am having was.

A 38-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 01May2021 as second dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2, on an unknown date, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced myocarditis on 05May2021, and in May2021 (reported as started 2 and a half days after receiving the second dose) experienced pleuritic chest pain, difficulty breathing, myalgia, headache, and flu-like symptoms. The patient was hospitalized for the events from 05May2021 to an unknown date. The reporter assessed the events as life-threatening. The adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room. The reporter assessed that the patient&#39;s events were caused by the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, a possible association of the suspect drug administration with the reported events cannot be excluded, due to a plausible temporal relationship. This case will be reassessed when additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Went to the ER at Hospital and took a CT Scan and MRI which showed bleeding. Brother had normal blood pressure and everything was fine with him but the stroke happened after a week of his 2nd Covid-19 vaccine dose. He lost strength in his left part of the body and had a speech slur and double vision. He had to wear an eye patch and had a headache. Hospital said no surgery was needed and transfered him to Rehab for rehab. He is currently there getting treatment.

We kept checking his BP and HR, and although his BP was stable the entire time, his HR started out at 109 and gradually kept dropping. After 3-4 minutes of shaking, we called an ambulance and they took over monitoring the patient&#39;s vitals. It was determined that his vitals were stable, his blood sugar level was 60, and after a while, the patient stopped shaking. He was released to leave by EMT.

                                                On day 2 or 3 of getting the shot, I started feeling a burning sensation in my chest and what felt like my heart. It was about 3 or 4 out of 10 on the pain scale. I also had intermittent tingling sensations, mostly on my cheek to the left of my nose, but also tingling in locations around my body which happened only a couple of times.  My heart beat rapidly. It was similar to the heart palpitations I get when I eat certain foods. It also felt as if my heart was constrained, as if its outer layers were less flexible than usual.  When the symptoms showed up I started following a fairly aggressive anti-inflammatory diet, mainly wheat/cereal and Advil. I spent most of the time  lying in bed facing up, in order to minimize strain on my heart. I had trouble laying on my side, since my chest/heart was sensitive to pressure. I also believe I was more acutely aware of the distribution of blood throughout my body, and laying on my side felt similar to being upside down in that blood was pooling heavily at the bottom, but I may be misremembering the sensation.  I don&#39;t know if I had shortness of breath, since I took care to avoid exertion. Since my heart was beating like crazy, exertion of any kind seemed like a really bad idea.  The symptoms did not change in severity for a couple days. On day 4 or 5 of getting the shot, I felt slightly feverish for about a 10 minute period. During this time, I noticed the burning sensation weakening slightly, and I began feeling a soreness on my chest near my left shoulder, which I believe is a lymph node area.  Each day after, the symptoms and my heart calmed down little by little.  ----  On day 9, I went to the emergency room since I still had heart palpitations and the burning sensation at about a 1/10 pain level. Just sitting upright caused my heart to go into overdrive. The hospital did not find anything out of the ordinary. I was given MAALOX, but the burning sensation was too faint to know if there was any improvement as a result.  Their best theory is that I had costochondritis.  ----  On day 11, after eating dinner I started getting &#34;chronic hiccups&#34;. These last anywhere from 10 minutes to a couple of hours without stopping. I am not sure whether food or drinks cause them. They are short/acute hiccups and happen at an interval of about 10-15 seconds. I have no history of such a thing.  ----  Today is day 12. The symptoms are noticeably better since I visited the hospital, but the burning sensation is still present around what feels like my heart and the hiccups aren&#39;t stopping.  My best theory is that I may have had an infection by the time I got the vaccine. Maybe I had an infection, not necessarily COVID but some related virus, that was kept in check below an immune response threshold until the vaccine came along and led to the immune system burning the whole infection down.

Pt did well with immediate CPR and cardioversion on the scene but he had no hx of major heart disease.  Minor LV dysfunction ( LV 45%).  It turned out on that the next day 6/1 pt developed fever and then COVID was checked and  was positive.  He then developed true covid and was treated.

                                                A few days after the second dose, I started experiencing heart palpitations - racing heart, extremely high heart rate sometimes in the middle of sleep for no reason. Extremely high, frightening levels every other day or so when just sitting, but constantly beating faster than normal all hours of the day. This made exercise at high intensity very difficult, and blood pressure was also elevated. Uncomfortability, almost pressure-like sensations felt in the area of the chest. I spoke to my regular Doctor and he referred me to a heart specialist where a 2-week heart monitor was prescribed.  I only suspect that the vaccine has something to do with the condition - I am very fit, I exercise and take good care of my body and have never experienced any issues with my heart whatsoever (including blood pressure) until after the second dose of the vaccine. I felt it is important to report this.   After a couple of weeks of experiencing the worst of it, it has started to subside but my heart has yet to return to the normal levels prior to the second dose. I still feel it beats at a higher-than-normal rate during exercise.

I received a  chest X-ray and CT scan that were negative for clotting.  Oral and inhaled steroids that were newly prescribed to me helped a little bit to be able to breathe.  I have no history or family history of asthma.  I still have difficulty breathing but it has slowly improved over time.  It is now June and my difficulty breathing has slowly improved but is not back to normal yet.  The symptoms have slowly improved and I haven&#39;t used the prednisone or inhaler for a few weeks.  I still have difficulty breathing but it is slowly getting better.  I will follow up with my doctor in 2 weeks (it is now 6/12/21)

                                                Per hospital intake, the patient had ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest in the field just a few hours after receiving his second Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination. EMS was called, and 20 minutes of CPR were administered, prior to achieving ROSC. Patient was sedated and intubated and taken into Hospital. Cooling protocol was initiated and CT angio did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism. Patient also underwent cardiac catheterization, which was was negative for clear intracardiac or coronary abnormalities or stenoses. Ultimately, the patient was transferred to medical center for implantation of AICD device. No other obvious source or etiology of arrest, but did think worth reporting given temporal proximity to vaccination.

PCP prescribes benzos to sleep. this allows some sleep with waking every hour. over the following weeks symptoms seem to improve slowly but still debilitating. today at week 8&#43; since one shot only, I am able to type again, but with nerve pain and numbness in all fingers. loud tinnitus, numbness in all limbs, episodes of extreme debilitating muscle fatigue come in waves, almost unable to stand agonizing muscle fatigue and nerve zapping. These full body muscle episodes only seem to come in waves of 24 hours, then seem to feel recovering, only to relapse again. injection site pain seems to have wrapped around to the bicep 24/7 pain. unsure if this is nerve or muscle. 3 ER visits, PCP visits, blood tests, no help. I cannot work, constant nerve firing muscle spasms and nerve pain and episodes of weakness so bad you cannot sit without agonizing pain. I am disabled from this and still searching for help

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 38-year-old male with no significant past medical history other than a BMI of 37 and a past history of COVID-19 infection in February 2021 which was asymptomatic with  no sequela after he was required to test after his wife tested positive .he is on no medications prior to arrival, he smokes an occasional cigar and drinks alcohol only occasionally who presented to the emergency room on 6/6/21 With a chief complaint of difficulty breathing,  fever, malaise and significant left-sided chest pain that have been ongoing since May 23 slowly worsening.  He denied any recent travel any recent illness any recent sick contacts.  He denied any illicit drug use over-the-counter supplement use .patient reported he received his first Pfizer Covid vaccine on 5/17/2021 and a few days after began to feel congestion with mild coughing which progressed.  He initially thought he may be having  allergies and took some Claritin without relief.  As the week went on he developed increasing shortness of breath and cough and also developed a fever.  He went to the well now urgent care on June 3 and was told he may have pulled a muscle and was sent home.  He returned back to our emergency room in the early morning of 6/4 complaining of again of left-sided chest pain radiating into his ribs with associated shortness of breath worse with inspiration associated with coughing but no hemoptysis.  At that time he had no complaints of fever or chills.  He works at a hardware store and thought perhaps he may have strained himself lifting heavy boxes of flooring.  During that ER visit he was hypotensive and tachycardic with respirations of 30.  CTA of the chest did not show any pulmonary emboli but showed inflammatory changes in the left side in the lingula consistent with possible acute community-acquired pneumonia.  He was given Toradol and morphine and was discharged home on oral antibiotics.  His EKG at that time showed sinus tachycardia the ST segments were normal.  He was afebrile.  He returned back to the emergency room the morning of 6/5 with complaints of worsening left-sided chest pain worsening shortness of breath and worsening fatigue.  He reported any movement he develops a cough and he cannot lie flat as he develops significant chest pain which is relieved with sitting up.  He had been taking some ibuprofen with minimal improvement.  He also reported some nausea and fatigue.  He had a fever at home of 102 °F just before coming to the hospital but arrived afebrile.  Patient admitted to having COVID-19 infection in February when his wife tested positive.  He was asymptomatic other than a headache for 1 day and recovered without any incident.  In the ER he was again tachycardic but was afebrile.  His blood pressure was 137/81 his O2 sat was 97% on room air.  He however was quite tachypneic with respirations of 35 at times at rest.  Lab work revealed a white blood cell count of 13.2 with significant elevations of his erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP at 75 and 20.8 respectively.  Covid testing was negative.  Repeat chest imaging reveals a large left pleural effusion and atelectasis with no pulmonary edema.  CT scan of the chest revealed no pulmonary emboli but now reveals right middle lobe and bibasilar infiltrates suspicious for an infectious or inflammatory process.    EKG revealed sinus tachycardia but no ST changes were apparent.  Was clinically dehydrated with an elevated specific gravity positive nitrites but 0-9 white blood cells on urinalysis.  Troponin at 0-hour was low -3 1 hour was -3 with no change in his delta.  BNP was normal at 14 lactic acid was normal at 1.1.  Procalcitonin was normal at 0.60 and lipase was normal at 21 with a normal CMP.  He was subsequently admitted to the hospitalist service.  In the emergency room he was given Rocephin and azithromycin. The following day his condition worsened with continued fever and increasing shortness of breath. . ESR was worsened from 75 to 82 and cardiac crp now &gt;200. A stat echo was ordered and his case was reviewed with the cardiologist. there was concern for possible myo/pericarditis so pt was started on colchicine and ibuprofen tid and the decision was made to transfer the patient to a larger tertiary care facility. stat echo showed normal ef and no sign pericardial effusion. He was transferred to another hospital where he was followed by cardiology and pulmonology. He ultimately underwent thorocentesis but the fluid reaccumulated so a chest tube/drain was placed. He was treated for a peripneumonic effusion. cultures and cytology were ultimately negative. acid fast bacilli was negative, blood cultures were negative. covid 19 pcr testing was negative x 2. He was discharged home on 6/11/2021 with instructions to continue augmentin bid for 4 more weeks with close follow up with pulmonary and repeat chest x ray in 1 month,

I asked the patient to please take a seat and I would come out to evaluate them and they said they could not sit and did not want to. I took an EPIPEN out of the emergency kit to have on hand when I was with him incase he progressed. I asked the technician to call paramedics because he was not getting better within a couple minutes of standing with him and when I did the patient left the pharmacy and left the grocery store. I did follow the patient to their car as they would not stop walking away. They said they would drive themselves to the emergency room and would not come back inside of the store. At this point the patient was talking with no signs of throat closure or progressive difficulty breathing. I observed the patient&#39;s face and neck and there were no visible rash/hives. At this point the patient left on their own and would not come back inside of the store and I informed him of their risks by leaving. The paramedics showed up after the patient had left. No intervention was given and no therapy was given to the patient.

This consumer (patient) reported for himself that:  A 38-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection; Lot number: ER8131 or ER8231 and Expiration date were not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 18Apr2021 (at the age of 38-year-old) as first dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 18Apr2021, he went to get the Covid shot through name withheld which Pfizer sponsors and it was done at name withheld. He went there and took the shot. He was told to wait 15 minutes and then left. When he got to car, immediately he felt like he had a golf ball in his left arm. The next couple of days, that little golf ball in his arm started traveling to his whole body. He felt it in his back, his chest, he felt it in his legs. Literally, in the next 3 days, he felt it literally travel through his whole body. He felt it in his calves, it was crazy also mentioned they felt sore or like ball in the arm. He started sweating and didn&#39;t feel too great. He thought it was standard side effects and didn&#39;t think much of it. A couple of days past by and then Thursday morning, he woke up and his breathing was very off. He clarifies his throat was hurting. He thought it was a sore throat and took some cough medicine and cough drops. Then the next day, it wasn&#39;t going away and was still hurting, wasn&#39;t getting any better. His breathing was very rough. If he was just standing still like laying down, then felt okay. But if went to move or do something it was very difficult. Again, expecting these symptoms, some people have said these symptoms and he didn&#39;t&#39; think much of it. The next morning patient woke up and breathing felt fine. His neck was swollen. He thought maybe he had a sore throat or something. He was taking cough drops to soothe his throat the following day, the throat was still hurting, and it was the same. The patient called the doctor and did a telehealth. The patient told the doctor when he received the first dose Pfizer Covid Vaccine and all his symptoms. The doctor said it is a little unpredictable, nothing the doctor hasn&#39;t heard. He went to the doctor office the next day and was hooking to a nebulizer for breathing and prescribed an asthma pump. The doctor thought patient had Lymphoma in the neck. The doctor wanted to go the following day for an ultrasound. He went to the ultrasound and they checked the neck and immediately there were red flags. His heart rate was checked, and the heart rate was 245. The patient was hospitalized from 27Apr2021 to 08May2021. The minute they saw heart rate and started putting intravenous and received treatment to low down heart rate. The heart rate went down to 170 or 165. He had x-rays and a CAT scan done. He had fluids in his heart and fluid in the lung and a blood clot in neck. He had a hole cut open on left side to lungs and the lungs were drained. He went back to the ICU, they ran another CAT scan and X-ray and gave the medication. He does not know if this medication was antibiotics or what the medication was. The CDC received this information because the patient case was so rare. When the CAT scan and X-rays were run again, the fluid is right back up in the lungs. Then he was taken to surgery for the heart. An incision was cut from where itches is to back on the side, a very big incision. The heart was gone into to cut a little piece around the heart. Something was cut out so the heart could drain, and fluid could get out of the heart. While all of this is happening, he wasn&#39;t getting any better, was getting worse. The patient health deteriorated, breathing was about 10 percent and was hooked up to a breathing machine. He was sedated at that time and not awake anymore. The machine was keeping him alive. Now, every day for basically five days he was asleep and not knowing what was going on and was tested for Leukemia, cancer, and A to Z every disease you can think of to try to find common ground. Everything came back negative; nothing was wrong with the caller. He was given this or that medication every day and was sedated for about 5 days. Every day of the sedation was getting worse. He was dying and time was ticking. On the 5th day, everything was getting worse. The woman kicked everyone out of the room and went into his mouthpiece on the ventilator that was keeping the alive doing the breathing for the patient. The woman pulled something out of his lung. The woman started pumping him with steroids. What the woman took out of his lung stopped the fluid from going in. The fluid wouldn&#39;t fill back up in the lung. Once the woman started giving the steroids, the steroids killed the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. The steroids reversed the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. He was started breathing on his own again. After a couple of hours, the patient finally woke up. The patient is now recovered and has been home the past few weeks on a whole bunch of medication. He is on blood thinners, steroids, and stomach stuff. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                1st covid shot: 10 minutes after I felt light headed and numbness\tingles throughout my entire body for up to a minute. (didn&#39;t eat prior) 2nd covid shot: felt similar symptoms but only lasted a few seconds. (ate that day) ------------------------------------------------  Issues\Symptoms Week 1  May 2-8 Right eye started slowly watering on Sunday and kept going for a week  Dizzy moment on a trip. Eye stopped watering mostly by Saturday -----------------------------------  Week 2  Dizzy moment again at a friend&#39;s  house(hadn&#39;t eaten that day).  Numbness through arms/weakness. May 10th: Panic attack. I was driving home and felt the numbness go through my arms so I pulled off and called friends to come and get me and take me home.  Ended up calling another firend who is a nurse and she had me squeeze someone&#39;s hand and check my face for sign of a stroke etc.  She thought I was having a panic attack and said to get some food, take some melatonin and try to calm down and goto sleep which I did.  May 11th: Saw General doc  who ordered blood work and heart monitor. No recommendations for immediate issue. EKG looked fine.  Through the week Numbness and tingles in arms and head Ringing in ears, lots of head/sinus pressure, unable to focus, brain fog. -----------------------------  Week 3 May 19th: Had blood drawn for testing: Night before getting heart monitor I couldn&#39;t sleep because it felt like not breathing fast enough made me light headed to the point I could pass out and was getting worried.  May 20th: Fitted with a heart monitor for 48 hours.  I was freaking out when we got to the hospital and almost went to the ER but we went to cardiology and saw the nurse who helped calm me down and did another EKG which looked good. Blood pressure was high that day possibly from the anxiety. Stayed at my dad&#39;s the next few days with the monitor, had tingles a couple times, some pressure, but slept well. ------------------------------  Week 4 May 24th: Followup with General doc said blood tests looked good, not diebetic, blood pressure fine, no signs of heart problems.  Gave me 6 days of prednisone and Nasonex for possible inflammation of Eustachian tube. (didn&#39;t feel like they helped any)  through the week: Felt okish for a day and a half, drove to work and then towards the end of the day started feeling off, right side feels like it&#39;s floating up and down, sensation down through leg which lasted about a week. Pushed in between nose and cheek on right side and felt numbness/pain shoot through my head on that side Periods of ringing again though not as much but also periods of head pressure and pain if resting head on hands etc. ---------------------------  Week 5 Muscle spasms in both arms lasting a couple minutes, finger twitching on left hand.  Also had muscle spasms in legs since.  ENT visit June 2nd: Audiologist tested hearing and saw no issues. ENT  gave me an exam and did not find any issues with the Eustachian tube or any other problems.  Suggested to do see if the symptoms continue to lessen and if they dont then do a VNG test and if that doesn&#39;t provide anything that he would have to refer me to a Neurologist next to see if they can find anything.  After the visit I came upon a web site and found that there are 300 pages of other people posting having the same symptoms as I have been experiencing for varying lengths of time, some upwards of 10 weeks. https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/ At this point I am absolutely convinced my issues have been as a result of some sort of reaction from the covid vaccine. There are way too many people having the same issues in a similar timeframe for not to be true.  In the few weeks since I still have symptoms that come and go but don&#39;t last nearly as long when they do. However it can still be quite disruptive depending on the circumstance.

                                                Heartache started about a week after getting 2nd shot of Pfizer. Never had heart issues before in my life. I&#39;ve noticed sharp, pulsing pain in the left side of my chest while in store. There pain pulses lasted for about a minute, then subsided. Since it subsided, I though it might have been muscle pain. However, I had the same pain happening 2 days later. Now it has been 2 weeks since my 2nd shot of Pfizer and I continue to get pulsing pain in heart area almost daily. It usually last anywhere from 1-3 minutes and then subsides. The pain is sharp, but tolerable, hence I did not go to a doctor with this issue yet. Again, I have never ever had this kind of pain in my life ago, nor I ever had any heart-related medical condition. I really hope it is temporary and will pass. For now I will continue to monitor and observe the symptoms.

A 39-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 08:30 AM (at the age of 39 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a hospital. The patient had no medical history and had no known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included testosterone. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 12Jan2021 at 12:30 AM (at the age of 39 years old) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient developed severe flu symptoms on 02Feb2021 at 20:30. The patient experienced chest pain and myocarditis on 12Feb2021 at 03:00 AM. It was reported that after 12 hours, the patient developed severe flu symptoms for the following 48 hours. Then she developed severe chest pain and was hospitalized for myocarditis. The patient was hospitalized in Feb2021 for 5 days. The patient received treatment for the events which included heart medications and heart angiogram. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination which included blood test and nasal swab, both with negative results on 12Feb2021. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event myocarditis was most likely due to influenza, which was an intercurrent infection, and unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162B2. There is no plausible mechanism implicating BNT162B2 to the reported event based on the drug known safety profile. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Within an hour of the shot, started feeling dizzy.  Intense fatigue and full body aches set in within 3 hours.  Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours.  Low fever, chills, heavy heart beat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours.  Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours.  At ~4 days since the first shot, the facial numbness, heavy heart beat, and fatigue persisted, though the drooping became less prominent and the other symptoms have largely resolved.  At ~2 weeks since the first shot, the facial numbness has been constant, but varying in intensity, and the left-side facial drooping has returned multiple times.

During the screening process, the patient did state he has an issue with needles in the past. Patient was with his wife who confirmed that it has never been due to the medication but just a fear of needles. Patient gets lightheaded. After giving the vaccine, the patient was fine at first but then did state he wasnt feeling well. The wife, came and held his hands and I was holding his back and head. Patient did tense up and shook once (not a seizure) and did lose consciousness for about 10 seconds. Had a tech call a code white and store management did come. Patient came back to and seemed fine. He had a Gatorade and drank that and also a bottle of water. Patient started to feel a little better but had a second minor episode (did not seem to lose consciousness). We also got a cold pack and placed on patient&#39;s head/neck. He ultimately took about 45 mins to an hour post dose and was able to leave under his own power. Patient and wife appreciative of efforts.

A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 12:15 (lot number: EN6208) as single dose at the age of 39 years old for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies: minor reaction to iodine CT contrast. Concomitant medications included fish oil, turmeric [curcuma longa rhizome] (TURMERIC), and xantofyl (LUTEIN); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced allergies (minor reaction to iodine CT contrast). On 11Mar2021 12:45 PM, within an hour of the shot, the patient started feeling dizzy. Intense fatigue and full body aches set in within 3 hours. Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours. Low fever, chills, heavy heartbeat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours. Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours. Facial numbness, heavy heartbeat, and fatigue persist, though drooping has become less pronounced and the other symptoms have largely resolved at 100 hours since the first shot. Seeking guidance on whether further medical help should be sought (did nurse line call with insurance company) and whether the booster shot should be administered. The AEs resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was given for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. No other vaccines received four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae.

                                                Patient lost consciousness about 10-15 seconds after vaccination administered.  Concerned initially that patient may have been having a seizure due to twitching motion of head lasting 2-3 seconds. Then patient appeared to be sleeping.  He was breathing, but audibly snoring and it seemed somewhat irregular.  I moved patient from chair to floor and had staff call 911.  Patient was still breathing but remained unconscious for about 1.5-2 minutes.  He then woke abruptly and was immediately lucid.  He was awake when EMS arrived.  He stated he has passed out on previous occasions of abrupt pain/use of needles.  EMS monitored patient for around 20-30 minutes, and he also had a bottle of orange juice and a granola bar and appeared to feel better.  Patient declined transport to hospital by emergency personnel.

Not really a dizzy or lightheaded feeling, but an odd feeling. The next thing I know, I came to on the floor. My security camera in the living room caught part of it from down a hall. I fell strait forward, onto my stomach with a large crash. The rest of the day, I did feel fatigue, joint pain in my knees and then chills/hot flashes later in the day/evening. The next morning (Friday) I woke up with a scratchy throat but felt fine the rest of the day.  I  have never fainted in the past. I don&#39;t know what would bring that on.  I also have not had that feeling or any fainting spells since that incident. My wife came home about 8am out of concern.

A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 25Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s prior vaccinations included tetanus shot on 09Feb2021. On 28Mar2021, 2 days after taking the first dose, the patient experienced reactions from the vaccine which included Itchiness on the abdomen area, knees, and toes and disorientation and went to emergency room for treatment. The patient wanted to know whether these are normal side effects of the vaccine. Upon follow-up on 28Mar2021, the patient reported that he felt weird after receiving the vaccine and lightheadedness. He told the nurse that he didn&#39;t eat before getting the vaccine. And wasn&#39;t sure if getting the vaccine was like having blood drawn so he hadn&#39;t eaten anything. The nurse told him he might be feeling lightheaded because he didn&#39;t eat and she gave him some lollipops and the patient felt much better. The patient also stated that on 28Mar2021, he was feeling overwhelmed and cannot describe the feeling. It was like itchy or pins and needles all over his body. The patient felt like he was going to pass out, as he as disoriented. The patient stated that he went to the Emergency Department. They kept him overnight, checked his heart, did some blood work, checked his blood sugar, gave him a Covid 19 test. The patient stated that everything came back normal. The Emergency Department concluded that the events could be due to the Covid 19 vaccine and described that his system was fighting the Covid 19 vaccine or something. The patient was asking if this is normal. He was also asking for a copy of this safety report for work purposes. The patient went to the Emergency Department on 28Mar2021 (around 7pm) and was in observation overnight. He was discharged from the Emergency Department this morning, 29Mar2021 at around 11:00AM. The patient confirmed that he was not hospitalized. The patient stated that he may be overthinking about the events and really paying attention to his body. He thinks he needs to rest as he was in the Emergency Department for a long time. The patient lab test included Blood sugar test. The outcome of the events was resolved for dizziness, unknown for feeling abnormal and overwhelmed and not resolved for other events.  Information on lot/batch number obtained. Additional information has been requested.

After a few minutes, I recovered and my blood pressure resumed to normal (114). As this was happening, my partner-- who was with me when I experienced the allergic reaction--observed that my face suddenly became red and flushed (a minute after getting vaccination).  Medical staff did not  need to administer an Epipen. They had me lie down and breathe. After about 15-20 minutes I felt normal. Medical staff had me wait a total of 30 minutes before releasing me.

After an abnormal EKG, blood tests showed a high troponin level. An ultrasound determined my heart ejection fraction had declined to 35-40 percent. An angiogram was performed that showed no blockages or tears in my heart. I was diagnosed with Myocarditis and admitted to the hospital. Over the next 36 hours my troponin level rose to more than 11 before starting to decline. I have prescribed a number of medications for treatment. On April 22 I had a cardiac MRI which confirmed the Myocarditis diagnosis. My heart function has improved to 55 percent and an EKG showed normal rhythm.  I have more tests and follow ups scheduled in the coming weeks.

I am a nephrologist practicing in my area.  10 days or so  after receiving Pfizer vaccine I started noticing left leg swelling and some redness. I didn&#39;t pay attention to it because I thought this could be a muscle or tendon issues because of my exercise. But the swelling did not go away, however, it decreased overtime with leg elevation, etc but when I checked my leg I found out that I have a DVT.   I am a healthy 39 ( when I received the vaccine but I am 40  now). I don&#39;t smoke. No family history.  I am on a blood thinner now.   I need to report this as I think that it is important to be reported.   I read in the news that a 40 year-old man was diagnosed with DVT after Pfizer vaccine  Please call or email if you need further info

Felt just like  Pericarditis that I had back in February.  This was confirmed with EKG.  Chest X-Ray unremarkable.    Pericarditis earlier diagnosed on February 16th, assumed by medical professional that likely had COVID at that time based on recurrence after vaccine.  No previous occurrence of Pericarditis prior to Feb 2021

A 39-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 39 years old, on 11Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included wolff-parkinson-white syndrome from an unknown date to 15Mar2021. The patient was diagnosed with this later in life, but was told he probably had it his entire life it just hadn&#39;t caused any issues for him. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously got the flu vaccine for immunization every year with no issues. The patient passed away from a pulmonary embolism on 15Mar2021. The patient was not hospitalized prior to his death.  He died from the pulmonary embolism in his sleep. The reporter denied any medications, labs, testing, or treatments for her husband relevant to these events. The patient died on 15Mar2021. There was a private autopsy performed and they said that the Pfizer Covid Vaccine was one of the contributing factors to the patient&#39;s death. The autopsy said the vaccine was a contributing factor. The reporter stated she told them since they said it was the pulmonary embolism that killed him, then that&#39;s what it should say. The Medical Examiner was saying that the science for the vaccine is so new, they just don&#39;t have the data that they need.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Pulmonary embolism

Signs/symptoms were growing chest pain and shortness of breath for 8 days until a CT angiogram revealed the condition.  Cardiologist was not able to identify the condition despite, EKG, echocardiogram, and nuclear stress test. ER administered IV steriod, and new cardiologist prescribed Indomethacin and Cochicine.  The condition lasted approximately 3 weeks the first time.  I am now experiencing a recurrence of the pericarditis/effusion which has been going on for 2 weeks.

A contactable 39-year-old male consumer (patient) reported that received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number ER8735), into the left arm on 21Apr2021 at 9.00 (at the age of 39-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had received the fist dose of vaccine on 31Mar2021 (Lot: EP7534) in the left arm at 09.00. Medical history included psoriasis diagnosed 25 years before reporting when he was 15 years old. Family history included his mom died of cancer, but she did a lot of drugs and stuff. Concomitant drugs were none. The patient reported that 2 weeks after 2nd dose of vaccine he had blood work done. He said the result came back a little weird on 10May2021. Erythrocyte were a little high, Hepatocytes were high, hematocrit was high, lymphocytes were high, and it says he tested positive for hepatitis B virus with little EAG. Caller states his glucose was high but he thinks that&#39;s just from what he was eating. The patient stated that the events required a physician office video visit. Caller stated his doctor was having him do another blood work test. Caller stated the doctor thought maybe it was the vaccine that did it. At the time of reporting the outcome of the events was unknown.

The patient screamed, and upon assessment the patient&#39;s eyes were pointing up and I could see the whites of his eyes, and felt like he was going to vomit. The patient appeared to be oriented. The patient&#39;s blood pressure and HR were taken, found to be within BP 133/90 HR at 124. The patient appeared anxious and said that he was &#34;seeing red&#34;, and continued to appear restless. The patient stated &#34;I am going to have an event&#34; and &#34;I think I&#39;m having blurry vision&#34;. EMS called while this RN comforted the patient during this time and appeared to become calm. Prior to EMS arrived, the patient stated &#34;My body is moving and I&#39;m not doing anything&#34;. The patient was encouraged to lay down on the floor as he stated that he felt weak, stated he was having chest pain, and continued to experience intermittent blurry vision. EMS arrived at 1213 and he was assessed. EMS suggested that walking over to the emergency department,and the patient agreed. The patient and son were escorted to the ED triage desk by this RN via wheelchair.  On arrival to ED Pt left stating &#34;I feel better and I&#39;m gong to eat some food and come back&#34;  Did not return

                                                Within a few days after vaccine had large rash across chest along with small hives and very itchy skin. This resolved after a few days after taking antihistamines (Diphenhydramine). About 2 weeks after vaccine I experienced significant chest pain, shallow breathing, very tense neck muscles, heart pounding at times, could not sleep or find position that would give any relief. Thought it was possible onset of a heart attack but was not experiencing any pain down left arm at all. Took both asprin and antacids which did not seem to grant much relief. By morning the symptoms became more manageable so I did not seek medical care. It took about 5-6 days for symptoms to fully resolve. Have not experienced any of the same symptoms since.
