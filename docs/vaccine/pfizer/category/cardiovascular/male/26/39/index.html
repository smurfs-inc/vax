Before bed time, had cold sweats and shakes. 1/29 - woke up feeling perfectly fine.  2/17 - Second dose of vaccine. Arm felt sore and was sore two days after. From 2/18-2/20, I noticed the effects of the Cymbalta were gradually decreasing and was experiencing side effects (shocks from toe to head every step). Turns out that even with taking my regular dose of the Cymbalta, my body after 2 hours feels like I had never taken it.   2/20 - After experiencing heavy shocks, shaking, and heart racing, I went home after coming into work 3 hours later.  2/21 - Woke up today feeling dizzy, fatigued, and weak. I know that operating a motor vehicle will not be possible for me.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving vaccination, patient started experiencing cold sweats and he felt like we was about to pass out. I took him into the clinic room and allowed him to lay down and began to fan him down for him to cool off. After 1-2 minutes, we put him on his back and elevated his feet. While he was laying down, I checked his blood pressure and it was low. I let him lay down for 5 more minutes and he started to feel much better and was cooled down. I slowly got him up and allowed him to sit and checked his blood pressure again. The blood pressure began to normalize. After 5 more minutes, I told him to get up and slowly walk to another chair in the room. Once he was rested there for about 5 minutes, I checked his blood pressure a 3rd time in the opposite arm and it was normal. He no longer felt the light headed feeling and was cooled off. The patient&#39;s partner then informed me that he has a fear of needles and the last time he received a vaccination about 7 years ago, the same reaction happened.

The Pharmacy intern noticed that the color of his skin was like a purple and he was passed out. When she started to approach him he started slowly moving his head and adjusting his eyes. He said he felt really dizzy and we had him lay down. He was very sweaty and was shaking a little bit. I took his blood pressure at 11:53 and it was approximately 124/93. He was responsive but feeling dizzy and warm and I stayed with him until the paramedics arrived at about 11:54

Once laying on floor I elevated patient&#39;s feet above his head. By stander reported that patient appeared to have blacked out right before I arrived on scene. Patient stayed upright in chair during blackout which only lasted a few seconds.  Patient stated he did eat breakfast but had not slept due to working overnight. Patient was assisted to sitting position on floor at 11:33a at which time he drank a bottle of water. After finishing bottle of water he stated he felt dizzy again and I assisted him back to a laying position on floor.  After 10 minutes I assisted patient back to a sitting position. After sitting for a few seconds patient stated he felt like he would get sick. Before I could return, patient vomitted on himself and over the floor. Patient continued to vomit/dry heave into trashcan for a few minutes. After patient was done getting sick, he drank another bottle of water. He sat for a few minutes prior to standing. At this time patient&#39;s mother-in-law had arrived at store to take patient home. Patient wanted to leave store immediately as he felt it was making him more uncomfortable due to current condition. Patient left store approximately 12p.

                                                First noticed symptoms after waking up during the night roughly 14 hours after receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Felt EXTREMELY fatigued and my heart was racing. Fell back asleep and woke up again around 8am. Symptoms persisted. Extremely tired and fatigued and heart was beating fast. Resting heart rate of around 100bpm which jumped to 120bpm when I moved at all (including just rolling over in bed). This persisted throughout the day, and I stayed in bed. In the early afternoon (about 24 hours after 2nd vaccine dose) I started to feel aches in neck and back and started a headache. Took my temperature and had a fever (101). Aches/headache continued to get worse throughout the afternoon. Finally around 4:30pm I found my Tylenol and took a dose. This substantially helped reduce all my symptoms; although I was still tired, it was much less than earlier in the day. Took a dose of Advil around 7:30pm and went to bed about an hour later. By morning, my symptoms were practically all gone, I was just slightly more tired than normal that day (2nd day after vaccine). I did not take any more medication.

So if they ask them make the total of vision loss lasted for seven minutes. His blood pressure went down. They kept him there and had a given a bottle of water and two container of fruit juice to bring his sugar level up. They made sure everything seems alright. And paramedics left and said that they thought it would be cause from some sort of blood reaction and allergic reaction to vaccine. And told them not to get the second shot. And let us want to he felt ok that it would be alright to go home. They did keep him there for about half an hour longer just to make sure he was alright and then sent him home. That was just a reaction and he should be ok now. No treatment received. The outcome of the events was resolved on an unspecified date. Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

He woke up at 0530 the following morning to take Tylenol and lost consciousness while getting out of the bed. He was taken to the ER for eval, had labs performed and EKG completed, reports normal. Also given fluid boluses and observed for a few hours then discharged. He has not had any reoccurring episodes and has returned back to his baseline.

                                                A 26-year-old male with no past medical history presents to the emergency department (ED) with an acute episode of chest pain. He reports initially mild dull substernal chest pain for a day prior to an episode of acute sharp chest pain that radiates to his left neck and left shoulder accompanied by diaphoresis leading him to present to the ED. He had received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine three days prior to presentation and reported myalgia and weakness beginning within 24 hours of vaccination. His blood pressure on arrival was 126/83 mmHg and pulse was 61 bpm. Electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission showed diffuse upsloping 2mm STE, no reciprocal changes, and PR elevation in aVR. Troponin-I on admission was 6.03 ng/ml prior to peaking at 21 ng/ml while initial CRP was 56.8 mg/L. Transthoracic echo (TTE) showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55-60% with hypokinesis of the basal lateral wall. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was consistent with myocarditis showing subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the basal inferior wall, no edema on T2 sequences, and a mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with an LVEF of 51%. He was started on colchicine, low dose beta blocker and losartan and improved symptomatically along with resolution of the EKG findings prior to being discharged with plan for close outpatient follow-up and repeat imaging.  In addition, a respiratory viral PCR panel was obtained which was positive for Rhinovirus/Enterovirus on nasal swab. Although it is possible that his presentation was secondary to enteroviral myocarditis, the temporal relationship to the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine suggests the possibility of myocarditis secondary to immunologic response to COVID-19 vaccine itself.

                                                I have had occasional brief chest pains, like a painful tightness around my heart that lasts a couple seconds at a time.  They have been random and infrequent enough I have not done anything about it (also, I am currently uninsured), but v-safe suggested I should submit a VAERS report of it anyway.  Obviously I cannot be entirely sure it is related, but it is not something I have experienced before.

A 26-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11May2021 at 11:00 (Lot Number: EW0176, expiration date: Aug2021, at the age of 26-year-old) as 0.3 ml, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Apr2021 about 5:00pm (lot number: ER8731, expiration date: Jul2021, at the age of 26-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. When he got the first one, he was fine. The day after he received the second shot, he fainted while using the restroom and woke on the bathroom floor on 12May2021 at 07:30, he was on the floor for a few minutes, 2 to 3 minutes. After that there was no other fainting. Patient had been having heart palpitations since the second dose on 13May2021. Did not particularly remember the time, just that it was in the middle of the day. The palpitations were going away and were less prevalent. He went to the Emergency room (ER) this past Sunday night because it was really working up and he couldn&#39;t wait to go to the doctor. Physician office was no. Electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood work were done in the emergency room on unspecified date in May2021 and came back normal. He was supposed to meet with a cardiologist next week. On unspecified date in May2021, he still felt kind of like he senses his heart beating but he didn&#39;t usually think about. It felt more strange, than soreness. This was all just so new. Thought it was a sign that he was going to recover and it was going to go away. The palpitations were coming on less and less. Was not so much of an irregular heart beat than last week. On unspecified date in May2021, felt like his heart was getting strong. Felt like his heart was making it&#39;s way back and was more like a sore or a strain. It had been going down and he was not feeling his heart in his chest. Treatment was no, not this far. There was not prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The outcome of the event &#34;fainted while using the restroom and woke on the bathroom floor&#34; was unknown, for other events was recovering.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly in unknown arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for routine mass immunizations (covid-19 immunization). The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Not a military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none and concomitant medications was none (he was on no other medications). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced tachycardia, intermittent palpitations, low grade fever/fever all started somewhere in the morning of 18Dec2020 and muscle aches on 17Dec2020. Physician assessed tachycardia and intermittent palpitations as serious due to medically significant. Physician stated that one of his workers had the vaccine and proceeded to have tachycardia and low grade fever. He would like to know if patient should get the second dose. The patient had mostly tachycardia with some intermittent palpitations. Patient was seen in his office on 18Dec2020, and got the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020. He also reported fever and muscle aches, although the fever was subjective and was not documented. Tachycardia improved and sent him to cardiology on 21Dec2020. It was not life threatening and they did an Electrocardiogram (EKG). His initial heart rate was 130. When he was seen again in their office on 21Dec2020, it was 93, which was baseline. It improved. He never got his temperature. The highest in office was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He had some muscle aches. The physician just sent patient to cardiology because he was having intermittent tachycardia and intermittent palpitations. Two visits to physician office. He was seen on 18Dec2020 and again on 21Dec2020. Relevant tests: they did testing for tachycardia but not related specifically. They did thyroid and EKG in office and he did not know if test were back. EKG was ok. The Thyroid, Complete blood count (CBC) and lipid (all were on an unknown date in Dec2020) were not back and were just done to make sure there were no cardiac issues. The outcome of the events was recovering. The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events tachycardia and palpitations cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I checked my HR on my smart watch and it said that around 12pm my HR was 157bpm which was right after getting the vaccine when I started walking home. My  resting HR is usually 47-52bpm. I am a very active person. I have been waking up in the middle of the night multiple times in night sweats and it feels like my heart is contracting very hard. I notice that my HR jumps up right when I start to be more active, but more than normal. On the 11th my average walking HR was 140. Today at work my HR was 134 at the highest around 9am and the lowest was 56bpm around 7am when I was getting ready for work. Additionally to the increased HR I have SOB when I walk and talk. I did have a sore arm as well the first day, but nothing more than any other injection I have had before.

No measurement was ever taken to confirm it was in fact high. He also became flushed. He was wearing a sweatshirt, so when he took that off he was feeling better. This episode lasted for 5 hours. No comorbidities or other heart conditions. We asked if he was possibly dehydrated or had any caffeine that day. I determined to proceed with dose 2 under the request that he came back after 1 hour and 2 hours respectively to get vitals.

                                                4/10/2021 experienced some right side facial paralysis upon waking.  Called urgent care who directed me to go to a hospital as soon as possible and asked about all events leading up to this, noting that the vaccine may potentially have this side effect, as written in the medical journal.  Went to the ER, they put me in stroke protocol, did CAT scan, negative results, blood tests (including for Lyme), MRI to look for tumors after the CAT scan was negative, and an echocardiogram as they detected a new heart murmur never present before. MRI showed Bell&#39;s palsey in one facial nerve, all other tests are negative, including for Lyme&#39;s disease, a common cause.  I am still experiencing it, and am on Valtrex (anti viral) and Prednisone, but the symptoms still exist. There is no other change in my life or health, the only thing I&#39;ve done differently is have the vaccine (for which we are grateful).

                                                I had intense stomach pains, muscle pains for 4 days. Could not get out of bed. Also had a fever. I thought these were regular side effects and eventually got better.   Then, about a week later I started getting nose bleeds with blood clots coming out of my nose.  These lasted a few more days. This never happened to me before, and must have been a side effect from the vaccine.

Patient mentioned it &#34;tasted like he threw up&#34; and still felt lightheaded after 15 minutes after the event. Patient was insistent that we should not call the squad as he does not have insurance. Patient in the meantime was trying to get ahold of a friend or family member to pick him up as we advised him that he could not leave in this state.

Squad did show up but there was nothing to attend to so left without intervention.

                                                27 year old male with Down&#39;s Syndrome and no other past medical history received second COVID-19 vaccine on 4/27/2021. On 4/30/2021 began &#34;feeling poorly&#34; with nausea/vomiting and possible chest discomfort. Originally presented to ED on morning of 4/30 - EKG completed demonstrated diffused ST elevation. Patient was transferred to Medical Center for heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries and LVEDP of 25. Stat ECHO demonstrated pericardial effusion and concern raised for myopericarditis. Patient subsequently transferred to a different Medical Center for higher level of care. Upon arrival to Medical Center plan was to intubate and take to cath lab for heart biopsy and PA catheter placement. However, upon intubation patient began to decompensate and subsequently developed cardiac arrest. During ACLS, VA ECMO was placed and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. Following VA ECMO placement patient received IVIG, high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg), anakinra 100 mg, and broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn). Despite these efforts the patient continued to have hemodynamic instability and was on high dose vasopressors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, angiotensin II, vasopressin). Patient subsequently suffered another cardiac arrest, briefly regained pulse with high dose vasopressors, but subsequently lost pulse despite best efforts and died on 5/1/2021 at approximately 13:00.

A 27-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EV8732/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 07Apr2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 27 years old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included COVID-19 on an unspecified date. The patient did not have any known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication (other medications taken in two weeks) were none.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 19Apr2021 at 22:00, the patient experienced similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down, Heart palpitations, left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck, low grade fever, severe fatigue and slightly dry cough. The events required a physician&#39;s office visit. The patient received treatment for these events. The clinical course of the events was as follows: Heart palpitations originating under left armpit with pain radiating to entire left shoulder through the middle of the neck. Similar symptoms to pericarditis, with debilitating pain that was exasperated while lying down, low grade fever, severe fatigue, and slightly dry cough. Lasted about 30 hours. Discomfort relief, like pericarditis, was only felt when sitting up and propping myself up by my arms leaning forward. Onset was rapid, occurring 13 days after the first dose of the vaccine over a period of 8 hours (palpitations came first, followed by shoulder and neck pain in the morning). Treated with Aspirin at first (low effectiveness) followed by NSAID Advil 7 hours later (high effectiveness, symptom relief was about 50%). High strength Advil recommended by MD. The outcome of the events was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

A 27-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EW0164), intramuscular in the left arm on 15Apr2021 (at the age of 27-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On 15Apr2021, immediately after the vaccine, the patient experienced syncope due to which he fell. He fell from standing and hit his head on a table. There were no signs of soft tissue injury. The patient was brought into the emergency department from the vaccination room. The patient was not treated for the events. The clinical outcome of syncope, fell from standing and hit head on table was resolved on Apr2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of  BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot  be excluded based on temporal association.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.

An ECHO was performed and LVEF was 45%, and an EKG showed possible ST elevation. Per the Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine study there were no reports of STEMI being an adverse effect. Given the patient&#39;s ejection fraction of 45%, there was likely a prior medical condition the patient was unaware of and may have precipitated the STEMI rather than the vaccine . Hospitalized for 2 days and diagnosed with pericarditis.

He slightly seized for a few seconds until it stopped. When patient came to he stated that his knee hurt but he didnt believe he hit his head and he felt a bit light headed. Patient laid down for a while with us until he started to feel better. His BP was 102/58, but normally  runs low. He said that he has passed out before and has been under a lot of stress, also had not eaten that morning before getting vaccinated. His significant other was with him and was planning to drive home. Patient was offered a call to EMS but refused.

After the second dose, around that afternoon/evening I started feeling my mouth feeling weird. The next day I saw blisters filled with yellow/whiteish puss in my tongue. I went to the ER later i felt a lump under left shoulder while showering. On 28 MAY 3 AM I suddenly felt my face feeling numb and tingly along with my legs. Mind you I have been in the field emplacing howizters for the past few days in a field exercise. I also jammed my finger on an 80 lb metal bar on 26 MAY and got my finger poked with a hot device that also drained the blood after getting an xray. I called medical ER  at 242 and spoke to Dr.(?) Doctor did not give me his name spelling after I asked for the spelling and he told me that I could always come in to the ER. I told him whether the finger pricking and blooding draining could cause the left facial numbness and legs tingleness. He said no so i am now assuming it is an adverse side effect. I am a smart guy have bachelors in journalism but right now I cannot concentrate and filling out htis form hastily just i case the effects get worse and I have to go to hospital er. Talking to the Dr. (?) was harder than normal and he asked if my breathing was normal, I said i am breathing heavily, which I did not have much control over. He said breathe normally and I will be better from the tingliness. I can write well I am a journalism major but this is hard to write for me . I am also feeling chills and I am also not feeling well. I was able to get this link from my local online meeting and I am glad I can contribute to the research and science in general. I wish the doctor had tested me for possible problems when I had an adverse effect from the first vaccine but the doctor told me to come back if the &#34;viral infection&#34; gets worse after I breathe normal. I did take a PT test and my 2 mile run time increased and it was much harder to run than the 2 mile run. Time went up by at least 3 minutes.

                                                five minutes after vaccine was received patient lost consciousness and fell out of his chair.   It is unclear if the patient hit his head or shoulder against the wall, but patient was talkative and responsive and did not want to call an emt.  The patient did call his mom to have her drive him home as a precation. The patient was given water, asked to lie down.   After about 10 minutes the patient stated he felt normal.

                                                Assumed it was a cold initially, due to sore throat. Sore throat came without other side effects of cold.  Used a flashlight to look at throat. I appear to have developed a canker sore on my tonsil. Because of the location of it, the tonsil is also agitated and has been bleeding leading me to have black stool as well as cough up blood and an upset stomach. This is something I have never experienced before.  It may be unrelated to the vaccine, I am not sure, but I figured it is something worth reporting.

On Tuesday 5.18.21 started to develop chest tightness and pressure (like someone was pushing against the center of my chest). Also experienced some shortness of breath. Went to Emergency Room Fri 5.21.21, all tests came back fine. Went to cardiologist in early June 2021 and in early June a cardiac MRI found everything to be normal. Cardiologist has me taking advil and prilosec at the moment. Have experienced these symptoms since 5.18.21 and has not gone away.

Pt underwent coronary angiogram which showed angiographically normal coronaries. Patient had echocardiogram which showed normal LV and RV systolic function, no pericardial effusion. Patient underwent cardiac MRI which showed LVEF 61%, RVEF 53%, and subepicardial delayed hyperenhancement in the basal and mid infero-lateral walls of LV. This finding was consistent with acute myocarditis. Patient was discharged home with a cardiac event monitor. No medications were prescribed.

Chest pain continued to worsen and presented to regional hospital. Started on Colchicine, had elevated troponins. Echocardiogram showing pericardial effusion. Left heart cath at hospital was unremarkable with no evidence of CAD.  Still with mild pleuritic chest pain with deep inspiration but none at baseline.  The admission diagnosis is myocarditis.

The patient was unconscious for approximately  1.5-2 minutes.  Our Chief Medical Officer was on site and walking into the room as the patient fell. We immediately placed him on his left side, protected his head, and stayed with him.  We called 911 immediately due to the uncertainty of health issues. Once conscious, the patient explained to us that he experiences such every time he receives a vaccine. He was assessed by the CMO as well as the EMTs that arrived on scene.  His vitals were taken. He was moved into a comfortable position and monitored.  He was alert and orientated x 3.  We requested he have someone pick him up instead of him driving himself home which he did.  This gentleman is also an employee and we were able to see him and verify all was well in the following days. We also recommended he tell all vaccinators that he experiences  LOC post vaccination. When he receives his second dose  we plan to have him lying down and our CMO will be present.  We recommended he follow-up with his PCP.

After 5-6 minutes he notes a syncopal episode that he describes as feeling like he randomly fell asleep. When this occurred, he fell back in his chair and hit his head. He notes blurry vision after this occurred but felt like he was slowly improving. While he was being brought to the ED in a wheelchair he began experiencing blurry vision again and his face became very pale. He was given some apple juice and reports that after 5-10 minutes he felt back to normal. While his vitals were being taken, his HR and BP were very low and he experienced another episode. Pt does not have a hx of passing out 2/2 needles and notes that he gets a flu shot every year and is totally fine. He does note that he became queasy when he tried to give blood in the past but that this does not normally happen. Of note, pt denies any leg swelling prior to these episodes.

                                                Patient has a history of syncope after vaccinations (last occurred with a vaccination 10 years ago) but did not state this prior to  receiving his first COVID-19 vaccine. About 1 minute after sitting down in the observation area, he fell to the ground and briefly lost consciousness. Multiple staff members came immediately to assess, rolled him over, and he immediately came to and was alert and oriented. He was taken to a medical area and laid down on a cot. He had unremarkable vitals and was breathing normally. He initially endorsed feeling lightheaded, but denied any other symptoms. He was given crackers and water given that he had not had much to eat or drink before the vaccination. He had a normal neurological exam. He was noted to have a superficial abrasion above and below the left eye (lower forehead and upper cheek), and a small Bandaid was  placed on the forehead. Fire rescue on site called EMS, who assessed him. There were no immediate concerns and he refused transportation to a hospital for further assessment.  After 1 hour had passed, the patient confirmed that he was feeling normal and he was allowed to leave. He was able to walk out of the facility of his own volition and did not have further symptoms when standing. His wife verified that she would drive him home. Prior to leaving, he was given strict instructions of reasons to seek immediate medical care should he have any new or worsening symptoms. The patient indicated understanding. Communication was performed via a Language Line medical interpreter.

                                                While waiting in observation my chest began to feel tight and in pain. The symptom lasted around 5 minutes and did not impede my ability to breathe. This concerns me since one of the allergic responses is anaphylaxis and I will need a second vaccination.   Additionally, that night at 8:30 and the following day I have developed a minor headache (5), feel fatigued and tired, slight nausea, and slight aching in my body (3)

Upon review of his lab results yesterday, I called the hematology fellow, Dr. through program at hospital and he recommended the labs to be obtained and rechecking labs in one week. He felt the student was not exhibiting any emergent symptoms requiring emergent evaluation. Patient and I spoke on phone after this call with fell at 1557 4/6 and I advised him to seek emergent medical eval in ED for any CP, SOB, HA or any neurologic symptoms. Patient has not had any of those symptoms. He exercised this morning without difficulty.   He notes raised papules on legs which he has had in past. They have currently been present for a few days. He believes it to be related to biking in sweatpants. He has been in a hot tub recently, but after the bumps were present. They do not itch. He has had them in past, more in winter months with heavier clothing.    He also notices slight left arm pain today. This was site of his vaccine. He denies any swollen lymph nodes. He is notices only with arm movement.   He denies any FH of blood disorder/ blood cancers/MDS. He denies bruising, bleeding or dark stools.   He states he likely has not had a blood draw in past, unless one visit to ER, for HA/concussion in high school (9&#43;yrs ago) resulted in any blood test.

Had a headache one day prior to admission that resolved with tylenol. Reports that he has hx HTN but home BPs (which he takes infrequently) have been 140s-150s systolic in the past. Has never been on meds for blood pressure. Chest pain was substernal 5/10 lasted 2 hours and believes it relieved with his blood pressure coming down. Does not describe any other alleviating factors. It was nonradiating, just happens for have left arm pain after vaccine that was present prior to chest pain.

                                                Heart pain; Fever; Headache; Stomach ache; Difficulty to sleep; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 28-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 28-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 03May2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 28-years-old), administered in Arm Left on Apr2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced the normal symptoms like fever but it was just a mild fever, headache, stomach ache, and difficulty to sleep but the reason he is calling is because he was experiencing heart pain. He received the vaccine for protection on 03May2021 and for all the symptoms he had all started the same day he got the vaccine which all the symptoms started that night. The heart pain was only 10 minutes to 15 minutes that the pain lasted and it was painful but he relaxed himself and the pain went away by itself and he was not scared. He just laid down until the pain relieved and he took no medication. The outcome of the event heart pain was recovered on 03May2021, while for the rest of the events was recovered on 04May2021. The events were considered as non-serious by reporter. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional administered vaccines. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

On 5/15 in the hospital he was having a hard time breathing and they were trying to give him meds to make him better, they gave him antibiotics because his blood work showed infection, and Precedex to help him rest, and he passed away the same day, he was in good health before. They also said his heart rate was 201/123 and the doctors said pulmonary anema.  It escalated so quickly.

                                                In the weeks following the first dose of the vaccine I began experiencing near daily chest pain, primarily on the left side of my chest. I also felt that I was breathing heavier than normal while doing normal activities, such as walking or going up stairs. I also feel as if when my heart does get elevated my heart is thumping and beating much harder than normal. This is unusual for me as I am young and in very good shape. This also came with frequent panic attacks.

After the shot I took him to the waiting area to wait for 15 minutes.  After about 3 minutes, he lost consciousness and fell off of his chair.  After about a minute he came to and slowly got to his knees and came to and was able to sit back down in the chair.

Monday felt fevers and chills and malaise all day. Tuesday morning felt some retrosternal chest discomfort that lasted an hour or so and spontaneously went away. Was able to go to work all day and do fine. Works in a garage and lifts heavy tires. Yesterday took kids to day care, felt a little pain that morning which resolved. Picked them up in the evening and was going to hang out with them but had recurrence of pain and this time was quite severe. Tried to take some tylenol but threw this up. Came to the ED and had to wait 1-2 hours to be seen, but the time he was his pain had nearly resolved. Troponin taken around 10000. Cardiology consulted, think this might be reactivation / recurrence of his prior myopericarditis.&#34; H&amp;P 3/24/21  &#34;This is a 28 y.o. male with hx of post-viral myopericarditis in 2013 but otherwise healthy who presents for recurrence of myopericarditis incidentally not long after receiving 2nd COVID vaccine                         # Myopericarditis             Had episode of post-viral myopericarditis back in 2013, at which time he had an elevation of Trop I (non-HS variety) to 7.3 and echo showing basal inferolateral, basal inferior and mid inferolateral wall motion abnormalities but otherwise normal LV function. Has been highly functional. Recently got 2nd COVID vaccine and had fevers/chills after that.             Recurrent chest pain 3/24 w/o provocation, aborted on its own but has trop elevated to 10,000. EKG does not show STEMI and patient actually asymptomatic in ED. No infectious symptoms. Unclear but wonder if COVID vaccine could have caused recurrence of prior myopericarditis? Cards called in ED, they would like him admitted, to treat with colchicine and advil, repeat TTE and they will consult in the morning.&#34; A/P 3/24/21 from admission

After 10 min, Patient signled me (the pharmacist) that he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  As I approached, he stood up and started walking towards me.    I took his arm, we took two steps and he fainted.  I laid him to the ground while supporting his head.  He regained consciousness quickly, but was disoriented.   NP assisted by taking vitals/911 called.  Paramedics arrived and then took over evaluation.  Pt was taken to ambulance for further evaluation, as he still could not walk to diziness.

                                                The day after (5/14) of receiving the second Pfizer dose, I developed muscle aches, fatigue, and swinging fevers.  These symptoms were resolved the next day (5/15), but that night I had an intense episode of chest pain that lasted 5-7 hours.  These symptoms went away and then returned again for a second time (5/17) around 4am for around 3-4 hours, while flying back.  I went to the hospital and had concerns from doctors over my ECG and raised troponin levels.  I spent 2 nights in the hospital and was diagnosed with Myocarditis.  This was then validated through an MRI the following day.  I am now resting at home for 3 months and taking ibuprofen.

                                                passed out; dizzy; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable pharmacist via Pfizer sponsored program. A 28 years old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 18May2021 6:00 PM central time (Lot Number: EW0185, Expiry Date: Aug2021, NDC Number: 5926-1000-01) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history, family medical history and concomitant medications was none. The patient has not had any other vaccines within the last 8 weeks. The patient got dizzy and passed out on 18May2021 after 6:00 PM after the first dose of the vaccine. They ended up calling 911 and the paramedics came. The paramedics checked him and released him, said he was good to go. He was not taken to the hospital. The patient did not visit emergency room neither physician office. The pharmacist assessed the events related to the vaccine and assessed as serious due to medically significant. The outcome of event was recovered completely. The pharmacist asked if he should get the second dose.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events loss of consciousness and dizziness and the suspect drug bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE)cannot be excluded.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to  Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I felt palpitations around 10-12 minutes after the 1st Pfizer dose was given, and asked the Doctor to take my vital signs. I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

A 29-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EK4176) in the hospital, via intramuscular route on 10Feb2021 at 10:30 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from 2010 to 2011 and allergies to penicillin on an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination, was the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: H9899) in the hospital, via intramuscular route at 01:15 PM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that on 12Feb2021 at 08:00 PM (also reported as &#39;3 days after injection&#39;) the patient experienced flu-like symptoms that included fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, and a persistent headache. On 13Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 4th day&#39;, the patient developed pleurisy and difficulty breathing and had 2 syncope events the morning of 14Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 5th day&#39;). The patient was taken by ambulance and admitted to ER for further testing. It was determined that all symptoms likely related to the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine recently received. Pleurisy persists one week following vaccine dose. The patient went to the emergency room/department or urgent care due to the events. As treatment for the event, the patient was monitored and given IV fluids over 12 hour stay in CDU. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae (reported as recovered with lasting effects). The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile.

                                                After leaving the vaccination clinic following the 15 minute waiting period, I felt normal and ran a quick errand before returning to work. After completing the errand (roughly 15 minutes), I began driving back to my office (roughly 10 minute drive). As I was roughly 1/2 mile from the office, I started to feel slightly lightheaded/woozy. I continued to drive toward the office, and within a matter of a couple minutes or less, I was overcome with extreme disorientation and faintness. Before I could manage to return to the office or pull over to collect myself, I completely lost consciousness and crashed into another vehicle. Even after the crash, I was unconscious for roughly a minute or so until I finally came to and realized what had happened. It then took me another couple of minutes to collect myself and exit the vehicle to assess the situation and ensure all parties were alright. Police/Emergency services were contacted and a police report was filed. After the event, I remained slightly nauseated for approximately 3 hours and had intermittent chill episodes, but the adverse events have since subsided.

                                                I felt soreness and pressure build up in my arm starting a few hours after the receiving the dose. The soreness and pressure got progressively worse over the course of two days. It wasn&#39;t unbearable, just uncomfortable. The second day after the vaccine I had stretched my arm pretty good for minute, when I released the stretch I felt a rush of something for from my arm into my torso. I got really dizzy and passed out, my wife was in the room at the time and said I never closed my eyes; but I had completely blacked out. My wife had woken me up and I wasn&#39;t sure what had happened, it took me about 30 seconds to realize I had passed out after stretching that arm. My arm had felt better after waking up from passing out, and soreness had passed a couple days later. I didn&#39;t get checked out,  after I woke up I started feeling fine.  I&#39;m honestly not sure if it&#39;s directly related to the vaccine or not, I just thought I should let someone know just in case.

A 29-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number ER8735/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 20Apr2021 at 08:30 (at the age of 29 years old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number /expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 at 12:00 (at the age of 29 years old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included was not provided. The patient did not have any known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included melatonin, fish oil, calcium.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 21Apr2021 at 02:00, the patient fainted, experienced aches, headache, fever, nauseous, excessively sweating, and heartrate was elevated to about 90 bpm vs resting heartrate of 60 and remained elevated for the next 12 hours. The patient went to the emergency room due to the events and received treatment for these events which included fluids. The clinical course was as follows: after experiencing expected side effects (aches, headache, fever), the patient got up to use the restroom in the middle of the night. About 1-2 minutes after getting up, he fainted. The patient awoke shortly after on the floor and felt nauseous and was excessively sweating. His heartrate was elevated to about 90 bpm vs resting heartrate of 60 and remained elevated for the next 12 hours. The outcome of the events was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had been tested for COVID-19 (saliva test) on 20Apr2021, and the result was negative.

                                                I received the 1st shot of the pfizer covid vaccine on March 11, 2021. Within 2 days I began to feel extremely fatigued. The days following I experienced night sweats, nausea, extreme fatigue, fever. I went to urgent care with a 102 fever, jaundice, and anemia. Urgent care sent me to the ER. At the ER they admitted me to the hospital. I was in the hospital for 3 days with hemolytic anemia. After a lot of testing and ruling out any infections, they discovered I have a rare blood disorder: hereditary elliptocytosis. The pfizer vaccine created an immune response and since I have this blood disorder I was predisposed to this event occurring from the vaccine (hemolytic anemia/juandice) without knowing it. It was a result of the vaccine. I was told to not get the second shot because there is no guidance, but that I am a high risk individual now. I need medical advice from people who are familiar and know.

He fell from the bench to the floor where he landed on his stomach. When I ran over to him, his eyes were open but his body was limp. I tapped his back and asked if he was ok, and he was startled as if I woke him up from sleep. He was alert and was able to speak, he asked for water and I gave it to him. I asked of he wanted me to call emergency services but he declined. He then vomited in the waiting room trash can. His sister was with him and began to rub his back and fan him. I asked again if he needed to go to the hospital and again her declined. I told them to please wait in the lobby at least another 15 minutes before leaving and he did. I called to patient around 8pm to check on him and he said he was fine and had no more symptoms.

                                                After getting the vaccine in my left arm, I walked to observation area and sat down in chair. Within a minute or so, I noticed my heart rate was slightly elevated and had a strange feeling of unease. Roughly 3-5 minutes later symptoms appeared and I noticed my palms were sweating and I had slightly blurred vision. At this point, I called for a paramedic and told them I wasn?t feeling well. They arrived nearly 15 seconds later (paramedics were stationed all throughout observation area). Symptom severity dramatically increased (very blurred vision, feeling of something clearly being wrong) and was added by a ringing sound in both ears. I was helped into a wheel chair and rolled into an enclosed area with a curtain around for privacy. Gatorade was offered to me and I took a few sips and felt very mildly better. Paramedics reported that my blood pressure was extremely low (63/28). They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital. Symptoms were the same and starting to very slightly get better from the Gatorade so I said let?s wait a few minutes to see how I feel. At this point they took my blood sugar measurement and found that it was also very low (53mg). They gave me some intravenous fluids and a glucose substance that was in a tube (sort of like toothpaste) and within another five minutes I felt considerably better. I received the IV treatment for roughly 20 minutes and symptoms progressively got better over the course of the treatment. My blood pressure went back up to 117/80 and my blood sugar went up to a more normal level as well (I believe they said somewhere in the 90s or low 100?s). After they removed the IV and blood pressure monitor, I rested for roughly 20 minutes before walking to my car and driving home.

It was unknown if the patient has other vaccine in four weeks. He has no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility the vaccine was administered was reported to be other. On 07Mar2021, the patient who has no prior medical history was admitted for substernal chest pain and shortness of breath; troponin peaked at 9.100 with no EKG changes. Heart catherization was normal. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care and required hospitalization for one day. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported events cannot be completely ruled out given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association.

He has a very brief episode of syncope at the station where he received his vaccine. He was assisted via wheelchair to the EMS station and was monitored for 30 minutes. His father was with him because of his history and both agree that he will be given his second dose while laying on a cot.

                                                Approximately 2 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient lost consciousness while driving to observation. He continued traveling through the barricades, hit a curb and ran into a light pole and secondarily hit a tree with the back end of his car. He immediately regained consciousness and denied having any head, neck, or back pain. He relayed that he is terrified of needles and shots, and has a history of passing out from receiving shots in the past. He also informed us that he has not had anything to eat or drink since dinner the night before. His vitals were as follows: BP 123/87, HR 104, EKG; Normal Sinus Rhythm. His girlfriend was in the backseat without a seatbelt and she had a hematoma on her forehead. Her vitals were: BP 138/90, HR 98, GCS-15. They both denied transport to the hospital and relayed that they would wait for the tow truck and seek medical evaluation at an urgent care center after.

                                                At approximately 4:30pm, on the day I got the vaccine, I began to feel the effects of Encephalopathy and Encephalitis, in which I began to feel pressure in my skull, and felt confusional thinking. It became hard to discern my thoughts. I also, began to experience a difficult time with my vision not being able to control what my vision was focusing on, as well as seeing a blue tint in my vision. I am also experiencing mild pressure and aches on the right side of my back and left side of my chest. These effects have been continuous for the last 4 days. To treat these symptoms I have been using natural remedies, and have maintained a stable condition due to that.

I asked the patient again if he was having difficulty breathing and he said no, but he felt dizzy and his heart rate was elevated. I asked him if he had any difficulty swallowing, or any swelling of the lips, tongue, mouth or throat - pt denied all symptoms. patient also denied a rash or any itching when asked. I also asked the patient if he had any nausea, which he stated he did. he continued to deny all symptoms except dizziness, and nausea when asked, and in talking to him while waiting for emt he never displayed any symptoms that would lead me to believe he was having difficulty breathing, or a true allergic reaction. when emt arrived and examined him his pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation was normal, and the patient stated he felt better and had a history of anxiety. patient declined to go to the hospital, waited in the pharmacy for a while longer, and had a friend come pick him up

                                                I&#39;m really hoping to get some guidance as I seem to be having a very strange reaction to the vaccine. Approximately 2 weeks from my 1st vaccine on 3/16/2021; I had sudden panic attacks. I never had a panic attack or anxiety before. Following the panic attacks, I have been struggling with several major symptoms: no appetite/ loss of appetite, chronic headache(almost daily), GI problems, and most noteworthy, daily inexplicable waves of anxiety and worry.  As mentioned, I have no history of anxiety or panic attacks. I also am experiencing chills, sweating, shaking, and a lot of brain fog/ inability to concentrate. The symptoms did start to subside to some degree, but as of today (4/24/21) I had more sudden and inexplicable rushes of anxiety and panic. Some other symptoms are an elevated resting heart rate and higher than usual blood pressure. I have also been waking from sleep suddenly with a feeling of jitteriness in my chest and palpitations. I have had trouble sleeping and almost feel like a rush of adrenaline hits me right before I start to fall asleep. I received my 2nd vaccine on 4/6/2021 because I didn&#39;t think these could be related to the vaccine. I&#39;m seeing many people online mentioning similar reactions after getting their Pfizer vaccine.

                                                A couple hours after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I suddenly passed out (syncope) and hit my head as I lost consciousness while home alone. I went to the ER where blood, urine, and orthostatic tests were performed. Head injury was mild and without compilation. I was given an IV for fluids to recover from dehydration and then discharged.

He stated he was treated at a hospital where it was determined he had a concussion.  He was later released and did not say he had sustained any other injuries.  He informed me at the time of his second dose. He stated he wanted to get the second shot but the doctor who treated him advised him not too.  I told him to delay until further consultation with same doctor or a 2nd consultation with another doctor.

It looked as if he had slightly hit shoulder first with no obvious head injuries. He came to in about 5 seconds in which he mentioned the fact passing out had happened to him before and was common with shots. The paramedics quickly attended to him and took blood pressure which came back normal. He denied transport by ambulance.

I took myself to the hospital who confirmed that hemorrhaging and blood clots had formed behind the site of my old ostomy scar inside of my intestines. I had no other signs of ulcerative colitis when scoped and no active flare, only this clotting that arose specifically after this second vaccine dose.

After 2 minutes the patient still felt weak and the staff proceeded to lay him onto the floor.

Upon deciding that he had not received any of the vaccine, I administered a second dose bc the hub was split all the way down.   I administered it and left him to go wash my hands.  After about a minute, we heard a loud sound.  When I got to him, he was getting up and was pale. His face was white, hands clammy and sweating.  He did not remember falling.  I took his bp which was 99/65.  My tech went and got him some water.  He started drinking and then vomited.  He said he immediately felt better.  his girlfriend went and got him some juice.  He sat there for about 15 more minutes.  He sated that he felt fine, but he had not had anything to eat or drink that morning.  (also a beer the night before).  He got up and walked out without any help and was going to get him something to eat.  He was hungry.

I didn&#39;t have any on hand, so I offered chocolate. When I came back he tried to reach for it, but was struggling. He dropped it and started making jerking movements and slumping over. I put my hand on his chest to keep him propped up and called for my technician. After a minute or so, he was responsive, but sweating and his skin tone became washed out. I told him he should lay on the floor and prop his feet up on the chair. He said that made him feel better. I got him some orange juice to drink after he got off the floor. He remained near the location for 30mins and then did some shopping to make sure he would be okay before leaving with his wife.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

                                                I felt fine the rest of yesterday but started to feel really tired and worn down late last night. I took my sleeping pill like normal and went to bed. I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

The patient got the vaccine and was told to have a seat outside the immunization room for 15 minutes at least to ensure no side effects. The patient wanted to get something in the store. Pharmacist was immunizing the next patient already. Patient knocked on the door and stated he didn&#39;t feel good and was dizzy. I told him  to take a seat I was going to get him some water. As he was about to sit down he passed out and hit the door with his head. EMS was called and patient was taken to hospital. The patient woke up 30 seconds after and was dizzy. He felt better after about 5 minutes.

This was 5-15 minutes post vaccination as he was being observed. We laid him on the ground and he immediately started to feel better. After a few minutes he sat up and drank some orange juice. Paramedics were called but patient was able to walk away on own accord. Called  later and was doing fine.

I had difficulty swallowing and felt pressure on my windpipe.  This has diminished a bit, but has now become shortness of breath and pressure on my chest.

                                                Pt went to sit down to wait 15 minutes after his Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 shot at about 7 pm on March 22, 2021.  Approximately five minutes later he mentioned to his female colleague who was with him that he felt feverish and sweaty and when he reached over to get a drink from his water bottle he fell over and passed out for a few seconds.  By the time I ran out to check on him he was already getting up and I had him sit in the chair while my technician called 9-1-1.  The paramedics soon came out (I think it was about 10 minutes) and checked him out.  Both theirs and my IR thermometers showed a normal temperature.  His BP was normal according to the paramedics.  They asked some more questions and ultimately let him go home under his own power with his female cohort.

However, it persisted throughout the day.  Typically when I was up and moving.  However, usually in low 90s when just up and moving.  I cross 100 when I&#39;m doing yard work or doing light exercise.  Last night when going to bed I was in lower 80s, when usually I&#39;m in lower 70s upper 60s at bed time.  Today, I haven&#39;t crossed 100 as much, but have been taking it easy.

I laid down and called a  nurse adviser. I was recommended to go to ER, so my wife took me to ER. They did CT scan of my head, then CT scan of my head and neck with contrast, then MRI of my head, then MRI of my head and neck with contrast. It was confirmed that I had an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE. It was decided to perform carotid endarterectomy surgery to remove a clot in the neck carotid artery. The clot was removed.

                                                On 4/19 he received the first dose of Pfizer vaccine oh 4 PM.  Administration of vaccine was uneventful.  The next day he noticed sore shoulder at 3 PM on 4/20 he noted he had upper wrist pain that progressed to his right thumb as well as redness with a shiny quality that was consistent with previous gout flares so he took 2 doses of colchicine and 2 doses of Advil which did not relieve his symptoms.  A couple hours later he noted hand numbness and tingling as well as feet numbness and tingling bilaterally.  The numbness progressed to his extremities with the left arm more affected than the right arm (he received vaccine in his left arm).  He had accompanied pain of his extremities and wrists that was described as 10 out of 10.  He then felt 2 episodes of chest tightness and difficulty breathing prompting him to present to the strong ED.  In the ED his exam was notable for hypertension (240/90), tachycardia, wrist flexion in distress and yelling in pain.  His exam also showed bilateral hyperflexion of bilateral wrist with mild swelling and diminished sensation and motor function throughout.  He was administered IV hydromorphone, and Benadryl with dramatic improvement in his symptoms.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine, I felt very tired and winded as if I was working out for hours on no food. I did eat that day. I felt dizzy and saw black dots in my vision and felt the need to sit down. I never made it to sit, rather fell flat on my face and passed out for a few moments before my cousin came and picked me up asking what happened. It was very embarrassing and I believe the fall on my face caused an infection in my jawline on the left side and a sinus infection. I was throwing up and blowing my nose from blood. Very scary sight to see.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 19Apr2021, this case now contains serious adverse reaction. Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) via Medical Information team. A 31-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were not reported) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was in excellent health and had no known allergies. The patient had took the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 18 days prior reporting (on 01Apr2021) and had blood pressure dropped to 70/50 and emergency medical services (EMS) was called an hour with him. The reporter was asking if the patient should take the second dose being that he had this reaction. The reporter further asked for the efficacy of one dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and how long was the coverage of the vaccine as far as needing a booster shot. The reporter also asked about the 6 months topline analysis results of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It was further reported that fifteen minutes after the COVID-19 shot on 01Apr2021, the patient passed out; the patient had a big blood pressure drop from 110/90 to 70/50. The EMS was called in and attended to the patient. The patient was there for about an hour. The reporter was just calling to find out if the patient could get the second shot. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

These began within 6 hours of the shot and were debilitating for 48 hours. Severe for 49-72 hours and then fever broke and other symptoms gradually subsided over next 48 hours.  At some (unknown) time after the vaccine, I developed viral pericarditis. In addition to the above, this manifested in chest pain (no difficulty breathing) which radiated from what felt like the lungs, through my windpipe, into a sore throat, jaw muscles hurting, inner ear and neck soreness. These symptoms lasted after all had subsided and didn?t disappear until 14 days after the 2nd vaccine.

Massive tension headache and pressure behind eyes and sinus that has lasted so far for 3 weeks, tinnitus, blurred vision, joint pain, muscle weakness, muscle twitching in face and throughout body, numbness in all my limbs, burning sensations on my neck and back, stomach pain, and heart palpitations that sent me to the ER. When I walk and move my arms I feel weak. The vaccine has effected my nervous system in a terrible way. The ER doctor, ENT, PCP, Optometrist, and Opthamologist told me it was inflammation due to the vaccine. I was prescribed 6 days prednisone, 40mg for 2 days then taper down and they put me in a &#34;let&#39;s wait and see&#34; mode. All symptoms have persisted since. I follow-up with a cardiologist on 05/14/2021 and waiting appt for a neuro ophthalmologist.

I then got in my car to drive home when within 3 minutes of driving on the road I lost consciousness and crashed my car into a pole totalling my sedan. I was rushed to the hospital by ambulance and did various test but thankfully I ended up with only bruises and scrapes.

                                                This is reported by his mother.    Around 10:00 AM he got his vaccine.  Mother met him at 12:30 and went to lunch, said he felt OK.  She stayed with him a couple of hours, went home and apparently he went to sleep.  The next day he texted his mother and said that he felt yucky.  She told him to give it a couple of days, and he went to work all week, but said that after he ate he felt &#34;funny&#34;.  Then on Sunday, Mother&#39;s day on 5/9/21 and they face timed and was supposed to meet him at 5:30.  At 12:45 he had finished eating, ate some enchilladas and said that he felt weird.  He said that he was going to be ok to meet him at 5:30.  At 4:37 PM she texted him to say that she was on her way to meet him.  She got at the meeting place at 5:30 and he was usually there before her, this is a normal weekend ritual to exchange his dog.  She waited 9 minutes and she tried to facetime him thinking he was in traffic, and he didn&#39;t answer.  She thought he was just not answering.  She then waited 9 more minutes and then called his phone and local Hospital answered the phone and asked who she was, and she answered the questions, and she told her to get to the hospital.  She went to the hospital and the doctor came in and told her that he had the car running and he went to the gas pump to get gas and he stepped out of the car and collapsed.  The person who saw him told the attended that he had collapsed and they called 9-1-1 and he was pronounced dead.  He worked in a warehouse and was doing well and about to be certified to be a forklift driving.  They said that they worked on him and that they could not get his heart started again.   They had to do an autopsy which is against her religion and she will not find out those results for 3-6 months.  She said that he was healthy and looking forward to get tested at work.  They told her that he had an enlarged heart and an enlarged spleen, and had never had any heart issues in the past.    He walked 20,000 steps a day in the warehouse.    He was living in a sober man&#39;s facility, he has been clean for 18 months.  He had an addiction to pain pills and Xanax.    She feels that there was something in the vaccine that had something to do with it as he was perfectly healthy before the vaccine.

A 31-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17May2021 13:50 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0178) (at the age of 31 years old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no family history and no relevant tests. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient took the first dose of the COVID vaccine. About 25 minutes after, all of a sudden, his heartbeat increased really fast. He could not figure out what was going on. He had slight chest pain as well. It started out with him feeling uncomfortable in his chest. He told his wife that something was wrong. He was driving and had to pull over on the side of the road. The total episode lasted two to three minutes. He felt like he was going into cardiac arrest. His wife called 911. Within five minutes, they were there. They checked him out, and everything was normal. He thinks that normally his heart beats 70 to 80 beats per minute. His heart felt like it was beating 200 beats per minute. He felt his heart beating up to his neck. He felt like he could collapse. He clarifies that his heart was beating very fast for about 30 seconds. After that, his heart was still beating fast, but it started going down. Then after two minutes, it started going back to normal. His heart was still beating fast because he was still very anxious. He thinks the anxiety after ward was making his heart pump very fast. He was going to talk with his doctor next week to get checked out and find out if he has any underlying heart problems. He has never had any heart issues in the past. The outcome of events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Heart rate normalized after half hour of rest. b) Acid reflux three days after vaccination. Took Omeprozole &amp; Sucralfate tabs and recovered within 3 weeks. c). Tachycardia &amp; palpitation occurred on 4/12/2021. Hard to fall asleep at night. Visited ER, no treatment (blood test, chest X-ray and EKG all normal).   d).  Excessive fatigue following just a few steps of walk, or speaking just a brief moment. Began to be sensitive to screen light and sound from loudspeakers. e). Hospitalized on 4/16/2021, b/c of breathing problem, numbness (hands &amp; feet) and muscle cramps. Called 911 for ambulance to hospital. Discharged on 4/18/2021 after testing normal for chest X-ray, EKG, echocardiogram. Prescribed Bisoprolol Fumarate tabs.  f). After discharge from hospital, I had to remain on bed b/c of breathing difficulty upon standing up or slight movement. Excessive sweat during sleep or after meals. g). Subsequently I felt a little better and began to do minor exercises (walking in the yard) May 14-19.  While lying on the bed on the night of May 19, I felt short of breath and worsening of breathing patterns (i.e. shallow breathing). h) On May 23, I began to feel shortness of breath when I walk or after a meal. i) Staring May 24th, I felt very weak breathing when lying on bed. Since then, I have experienced weaker &amp; weaker tidal volume. j) Staring May 27th, I felt shallow breathing when I was at rest during the day. Since then, I have experienced weaker &amp; weaker tidal volume.

I experienced a squeezing/painful sensation in my heart every 1-2 minutes for over 72 hours. Also experienced dizziness. Went to ER on 05/26/2021 to make sure heart was okay. Released.  I am an avid runner, extremely healthy, no surgeries, and have never experienced anything like this in my entire life.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

                                                I was sitting down at work when out of the blue I experienced heart palpitations, lightheadedness, weakness and shortness of breath that lasted for about an hour. I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

Within 5-10 minutes he slumped in his chair and became unresponsive. Became responsive to voice but was slurring his words. Patient was diaphoretic. HR in 90s, O2 98%. His eyes rolled back in his head  suspecting vasovagal episode, we moved patient to the floor  and raised his legs. He became more responsive. Was fully oriented although did not seem incredibly alert. Cycled multiple BPs with 100s-110s/60s-70s. HR 70s-80s  supine, O2 sat 96-98%.  EMS was called for transport to ED given patient&#39;s lack of prompt recovery. We  attempted to sit patient up and he again became lightheaded and had to lie back down. While in supine position, remained with normal and stable VS. At no time did he manifest any rash, respiratory symptoms, throat or chest tightness,  abdominal discomfort, or other overt signs of anaphylaxis.   Patient was transported to the ED where ROS was reported as:   - CONST: &#43;fatigue, denies fevers or chills  - EYES: Denies vision changes  - ENT: Denies rhinorrhea, sore throat  - CV: Denies new chest pain  - RESP: Denies SOB or cough  - GI: Denies abd pain, n/v, diarrhea  - GU: Denies dysuria  - MSK: Denies new joint swelling or pain  - SKIN: Denies new lesions or rash  - NEURO: Denies new HA, numbness, or weakness  - PSYCH: Denies suicidal ideation Vitals: BP 116/67, O2 99% on RA, Temp: 97.7F, Pulse 79.  ED provider felt this was most likely vasovagal episode given occurrence following vaccine administration and associated sxs. EKG without evidence of dysrrhythmia. No PE risk factors, SOB or CP. Pt with HA that was not thunderclap nor severe in nature and was consistent with prior migranes, thus do ot suspect SAH. No hx to suggest anemia and no anemia on blood work today. No report of  seizure. Pt is alert without report of post-ictal period.

He was in his usual state of health and doing well until he received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine around 0740 this morning.  Around 10 minutes following the vaccine, patient became short of breath, lightheaded and had his vision gray out before losing consciousness for few seconds.  Patient was sitting in a chair at that time and did not fall or hit his head.  He was then given juice and was able to ambulate and felt better.  Patient was directed to the emergency department for evaluation.  He states that he now feels back to his baseline with no lightheadedness or difficulty breathing.  Patient states that he has passed out following blood draws in the past and usually lies down afterward. Patient&#39;s presentation is overall most consistent with vasovagal syncope, especially given his history of similar events following blood draws.   Patient was observed in the emergency department for nearly an hour and remained asymptomatic so he was discharged home with return precautions

Pt was tapped, and verbally asked if he could hear us. Initially there was no response. Checked for breathing, then begin checking for pulse, but he came to. He started speaking with us, saying he was feeling light headed, and got up to notify us, but then he couldn&#39;t remember the rest. Asked if he had a history of seizures or diabetes and he said no to either. At some point he went out again, briefly. Meanwhile, the tech called 911. He came to again, begin talking with us. At some point he requested water, which we got. After seeping, he wanted to sit up. We asked him to place his back against the wall, if he wanted to. He did so, and after a few seconds said he wanted to lay down again. EMS came. They asked if he wanted to go to the ER which he consented to. They rolled him out on a stretcher.

About 10 minutes after his vaccination, patient fell off his chair to the ground and had a syncopal event. He appeared to lose consciousness for a few seconds and then became alert. He had a slightly bloody nose, which we cleaned up. We laid him down on the floor and monitored his blood pressure while applying a cool compress to his forehead and neck.  He was doing fine, so we continued to monitor him for another hour. He mentioned he had not eaten since the night before at 5pm. We gave him a protein bar and some juice and water( after about 1/2 hour) and he felt much better.   We advised him to contact his doctor if he did not feel better later today. Patient received a ride home.

                                                I had one large cup of coffee with cream and 3 doughnuts for breakfast approximately 3 hours before the vaccine. I took one Claritin Readitab approximately 2 hours before my vaccine injection to help with pollen allergies.   I was seated during the vaccine injection.  The injection was delivered into upper left arm. I felt fine at first. I stood and exited the room and began speaking with the pharmacist that had delivered the invention to receive instructions. Approximately 2-5 minutes after I received the injection I began to feel dizzy. After approximately 1 minute of dizziness I sat down.  I began to get extremely dizzy to the point of faintness. I noticed during this time that I was getting very sweaty. My skin over my whole body seemed to me to be damp from sweat and where I checked I was sweating visibly (no droplets formed? it was just dampness). At the same time I experienced nausea. I believed that I might throw up, so I requested something to throw up into. I never threw up. I continued to get more and more dizzy and I had trouble remaining upright (while seated). A woman observing me stated afterward that my eyes rolled back and that I fainted. I do not believe that I actually fainted because I remember hearing her tell the pharmacist that I had passed out. I had my eyes closed though, so it is possible that I fainted briefly.  The pharmacist called 911. I began to feel better approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I stopped sweating, and then the nausea subsided, and then my dizziness cleared up.   The EMTs arrived approximately 20 minutes after I received the vaccine and took my blood pressure. I do not remember the reading, but the EMT stated that it was not elevated. My blood oxygen was 99%. The EMT waited about 10 minutes and took my blood pressure again. He stated that it was higher, but not concerning. The EMT waited another 10-15 minutes and then left. Before he left, the EMT stated to me that I was one of 2 concurrent calls regarding adverse vaccine responses.   After this event I drank a bottle of  water. It did not seem to have an impact.   I have not received vaccinations since I was a child. I do not remember adverse reactions to injections when I was a child. I did pass out when giving blood approximately 12 years ago. I have always attributed this to the fact that I did not eat or drink for 20 hours prior to donating blood.

                                                The patient began to vomit within 10 minutes of receiving his vaccine . He was also having numbness in his left hand.  I sat with the patient in the consultation room for 20 minutes, until he became more calm. I offered him some water and I took his blood pressure every 5 minutes.  It was initially 154/105 and eventually decreased to 140/90. His heart rate was normal and he had no shortness of breath or signs of any rash. He threw up twice.  I offered to call ems for him if he wanted  but he declined. Once his blood pressure decreased he said that he felt better and sat in the pharmacy waiting area until he felt completely better. I called him 30 minutes after his departure from the pharmacy to make sure he got home safe and he was thankful for the call. I did advise him to contact his PCP if the numbness in his hand worsens or does not get better. I also told him to seek medical help if he gets any shortness of breath, rash or other unusual symptoms.

Temp had remained normal throughout and never reached above 99.6. Took a rapid test on 04/23/2021 at Urgent Care, and a lab test from pharmacy for COVID on 05/23/2021; both came back negative.

                                                On Friday morning  at work, I felt a sharp pain around the left side of my chest.   It sharp pain comes and goes very often throughout the morning and day.  I would describe the pain as a mini heart attack even though I never experienced a heart attack.    Today, the sharp pain around my chest area isn?t as strong as before but I do not feel 100 percent.  There is a feeling in my chest area that I can?t shake out.  It could be all psychological but who knows.

                                                I received the COVID-19 vaccine at 9:30 am from vaccination clinic. I had just recovered from COVID-19 about two and a half weeks prior. I had no immediate reaction. I worked the entire day with no adverse effects other than a sore arm, which I expected. Later in the day at about 7:45 pm I went for a 6 mile run and got home at approximately 8:49 pm. Within half an hour of getting home, I quickly became feverish. The fever continued to rise until I was extremely hot, and hotter than I can ever remember as an adult or child. I did not have access to a thermometer so I cannot reliably report what the temperature was but I am estimating 103. It felt like every part of my body, including my legs, was hot to the touch. By 1 am I had serious chills and was shivering under winter blankets despite an outdoor temperature of 70-80. In addition, I had an extremely elevated heart rate and chest pain. I also had generalized muscle aches all over my body.  I did not sleep at all that night. The fever began to slowly dissipate early in the morning but the elevated heart rate continued for approximately 24 hours. The discomfort resulting from my elevated heart rate was substantial and alarming enough that I sought advice from my primary care physician after a nurse at my Occupational Health clinic suggested potentially getting an ECG. Ultimately, by Thursday morning, the symptoms had decreased and I declined any follow up. However, this was the single worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to any vaccine and the single worst fever I&#39;ve ever experienced as an adult or in my memory as a child. Although I am aware that people who have already had COVID-19 tend to have worse reactions to the first COVID vaccine, I am filing this report primarily because of my concern that exercise may trigger an especially severe reaction.

                                                In the morning of May 2nd I was driving and I felt my heart rate increasing lasted about 30 minutes to an hour. I ended up going to the ER and I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia, I stayed overnight. After that event I developed a cognitive fog and a sensation of numbness on the left side of my head like someone is pulling the skin on my face ever so slightly. I also developed a sense of imbalance like I am in a boat for an extended period of time. These feelings remained constant and I noticed that they were getting better by May 19th. At 6 am on May 19th I walk up to the feeling of my heart pounding and my heart rate increasing, I measured my pulse on my watch and it was around 150 bpm average. This event lasted about 5 minutes and went away. On May 19th around 10 pm I was in the shower and my heart rate increase again and I felt a tickling sensation on the left side of my chest when I was breathing in. I ended up going to the ER gain and stayed overnight. May 26th I felt the sensations of fogginess and just feeling off cognitively. May 27th I woke up rested without fogginess and after a morning walk with my dog I felt my heart increasing. This episode lasted about 10-20 minutes and my heart rate was ranging between 120-150 bpm. My stools from April 20th till May 26th have been lighter in color yellowish and soft, when I consumed vegetables I could see specs of them in my stools like they were not fully processed. May 27th was the first day where my stool color was brown but still soft.

He got lightheaded and passed out as he was bending over. The patient hit his head and briefly passed out. We got him to the ground slowly and provided him with an ice pack and bottle of water. He was breathing quickly and shallowly for about 30 seconds but returned to normal shortly after.

The patient was pacing back and forth deciding if he should get his vaccine or come back another day. He decided to get vaccinated. Immediately after the vaccine was administered the patient, while still sitting down,  passed out and leaned forward falling on the floor. As the intern reached down to help the patient he came to and was able to get back on the chair on his own. At that point the PIC and the intern remained with the patient for observation and provided water. The patient remained under observation for about half an hour and expressed he felt well enough to go home.

                                                In the weeks after 2nd vaccine dose, experienced chest tightness/pain in heart area. At the time I thought this was due to recent weight gain and lack of good sleep, however now I believe it is related to the heart inflammation symptoms reported in the media by outlets such as Reuters. The tightness/pain was intermittent meaning it did not occur all the time, but I would feel it for some part of the day and it would recur. This lasted for about a month and seems to have gotten better. However, I am about to schedule an appointment with a cardiologist in order to get this looked at as I am worried of what other unknown side effects will be in time.

I advised to go to ER for evaluation. I followed up on Tues 6/8/21 and he stated the ER said he has inflammation of the heart and lungs but sent him home. Also none of the previous symptoms had resolved and he also has pain in left upper chest, decreased energy and loss of appetite. The patient said he doesn&#39;t have a PCP so I advised to go to ER again.

                                                After receiving the vaccine the patient was instructed to sit at the designated post vaccination area. As he was sitting in the chair, a few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient lost consciousness and fell from the chair onto the floor. The patient was unresponsive for a few seconds. When I positioned him in an upward position he regained consciousness and did not remember what happened. The patient had a fast heart rate and was feeling hot, dizzy, and nauseated. He showed no signs of anaphylactic/allergic reaction. Patient admitted he was nervous and anxious about the vaccine and does not like needles. I instructed the patient to remain seated on the floor and gave him an ice pack, water, and told him to take deep breathes. Patient stated he felt better. The store manager and I called 911 to get paramedics to check his vitals. Patient denied to go to emergency room, said he was feeling better. Patient confirmed he lived only a few blocks away and he had someone to drive him. Paramedics cleared the patient and stated all vitals were in normal range. Patient stayed at the pharmacy for 10 more minutes after that with instructions if he felt any symptoms to call his doctor or 911.

My PCP also advised to get the 2nd dose.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

                                                Patient presented for his first vaccine dose. He later stated he felt a sensation of something moving through his arm after vaccine administered, then states he felt some increased anxiety, followed by cold sweats, and then lost consciousness.  He was noted to be unresponsive, initially with brief period of apnea, and was unresponsive to sternal rub by vaccine administration staff.  He was placed into a reclined position in the driver seat of his vehicle. He regained consciousness within a minute, and was normally responsive but with pale color noted to face and chest, diaphoresis, and thready pulse with bradycardia, HR 43.  Difficult to auscultate HR and breath sounds clear but shallow. EMS responded promptly and assisted with evaluation, with initial BP 80/50, SpO2 97%.  Patient became less responsive and started to lose consciousness again, but responded to questioning, then lost consciousness again. His feet were placed on the dashboard to elevate them, and he quickly regained consciousness, pulse improved to HR 86, and repeat BP after a few minutes was 140/76. Oxygen saturations briefly dipped to 90% then rebounded to 100%. He improved quickly, was normally responsive and able to drink orange juice. He had pale clammy skin on the face, neck and hands, and some facial flushing.  Patient was monitored for several minutes, had improvement in symptoms, and refused transport by stretcher to the ambulance. He was able to walk to the passenger side of his vehicle and was driven out of the vaccination facility and further monitored. Blood glucose noted to be 96, EKG normal with sinus rhythm, no acute ST or T wave changes or other acute abnormality.   Patient was offered transport to the hospital for further evaluation, but he declined. Symptoms resolved completely, he was monitored for resolution of symptoms. He reported prior similar symptoms after a hand laceration at work and after a dental visit. Risks discussed, prevention measures for second dose discussed. Encouraged follow up with PCP given recurrent vasovagal syncope. No signs of allergy noted.

I had him lie down on the floor with his feet up for about 10 minutes until he felt confident to sit in the chair for another 10 minutes or so.  As he was lying on the floor, We brought him a bottle of water.  His color came back shortly after lying down on the floor.  He stated that he has previously had panic attacks after shots, blood draws, etc.  He stated he was no longer dizzy when he stood up to leave.

Went to bed at 11:00 pm and woke up at 2 am with heart thumping with pulse beating around 70 beats per minute. Became highly attuned to it and experienced tacychardia at 118 (generally resting heart rate is extremely low). Seemed to return to 70 with some breathing exercises and returned to sleep. Woke up the next morning with flu symptoms and the works - felt worse than original Covid in October. Flu like symptoms seemed to pass by Monday. However, pulse remained elevated through the week by about ten points and noticed hypertension. BP 150/95 Wednesday and 160/100 on Friday. Went to ER Friday night with BP 188/117 and tachycardia. Vitals and blood work all normal however confusion as to why BP remains elevated despite Thursday before vaccine being 132/82. Left hospital with BP 154/95. Palpatations and thumping chest have continued throughout the week. As well as general fatigue and fog behind the eyes.

                                                I received my first dose of the pfizer vaccine at 11am at the safeway pharmacy. I had consumed several glasses of water in the morning before the event, a cup of yerba mate tea, and a piece of toast. I smoke, and had smoked one cigarette in the morning before my appointment. Just after receiving the vaccine I ate a few pieces of jerky and maybe 15 Jojo potatoes from the safeway deli.  I was advised to wait 15 minutes before leaving. I set an alarm. I bought some food to eat (jojo potatoes and jerky) and waited to leave the site until 11:22am. I felt strange/weird, but this isn&#39;t an unusual feeling after receiving any kind of shot/vaccine for me.   I was driving to work and I started to feel just a little bit strange after smoking another cigarette. I got a little nauseous but nothing too bad. Thirty seconds later I started to get dizzy, my ears rang, I felt my blood pressure drop, and I passed out on the interstate going freeway speeds. I woke up around a minute and half later according to my brother who was on the phone. I was treated for injuries at emergency room.

I was alone at the time so I dont know if hitting my head on the floor or the fainting caused loss of consicousness. I was out for 20 min to 1 hour. Lost 4-8 oz of blood from bloody nose caused by hitting my head on the floor.

                                                Within 2 minutes of vaccine i became very light headed and needed to lay down and was sweating. This is common with me with any vaccine. Within 24 hours severe shortness of breath and severe chest pains. Went to 2 urgent cares. Was prescribed Prednisone and a Inhaler. Both did nothing. Symptoms got worse. went to my primary doctor who ordered a chest X ray which came back good. and a EKG which came back with a slight issue and referred me to a cardiologist next month. Was sent home to recover. Pain and shortness of breath got worse. Within a week after that i got severe headaches and the left side of my head arm and leg began to get numb and tingle sensation  which lasted about 48 hours. About 2 weeks after vaccine i began to improve. Chest pain started to go away and my shortness of breath as well. As of today 4-18-2021 no chest pain, and shortness of breath still comes and goes but nothing compared to weeks before.

A 33-year-old patient (husband) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 05Apr2021 15:40 (Lot Number: ER8734) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atopic dermatitis. Concomitant medication included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), an injection that patient takes every other week to control his atopic dermatitis, he has been using this for 3 years at least. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER6207) in left shoulder on 15Mar2021 15:40, at the age of 32 years old, for COVID-19 immunization, and experienced arm sore and body aches. The patient experienced vomiting blood in Apr2021, blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up / spitting up blood in Apr2021, he feels like his throat is so raw on 05Apr2021, sore arm on 05Apr2021, feeling achy/ her husband is still sore/achy today on 05Apr2021, nauseous on 05Apr2021, vomiting/ throwing up on 05Apr2021, diarrhea on 05Apr2021, chilly in Apr2021, redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids; his pores looked red in Apr2021, fatigue on 05Apr2021. No treatment received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events pain in arm, ache, nauseous, erythema, fatigue was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Clinical course as reported: Her husband got their second dose of the vaccine on 05Apr2021. Her husband was having a more severe reaction than the first time. The first time he got the vaccine his arm was sore. Last night (05Apr2021), the caller&#39;s husband was vomiting just over and over and had diarrhea, both at the same time. Wife added the thing she was worried about was that her husband was vomiting blood as well, and that her husband said it was from the phlegm, like he felt like his throat was so raw. Her husband did not really want to eat anything which she expected was normal. She was trying to give him fluids, and having him drink a little bit. Her husband had not vomited since around 4 am. And right now, he was sleeping. She did not know if she should give him medicine or take him to be seen or if this was a normal reaction to the vaccination. She did read side effects from the paper and she saw that some vomiting was expected but the blood was what caught her off guard. Around 10 o&#39;clock last night (05Apr2021), her husband felt nauseous and went to bed. She actually fell asleep on the couch and heard her husband vomiting across the house, that was how bad the vomiting was. The vomiting started at midnight last night (05Apr2021). Her husband has been vomiting every couple of hours (2 hours), around the clock. Diarrhea had been at the same time. From her understanding, her husband had vomited at least 3 or 4 times, and had diarrhea 3 or 4 times. She kind of lost track after the 3rd time, but she had not heard him since around 4 am Her husband was still sore/achy today (06Apr2020) and was is still nauseous. She believed he was also feeling chilly. He was wrapped up in his blanket. Her husband did not have a fever, she has been checking his temperature. Wife stated no treatment yet, as she did not know what was safe. Her husband wanted to wait until he stopped vomiting because anything he put in his stomach came right back up. After the first time her husband was done throwing up, and was only dry heaving, he started to like kind of spit. When he would gargle or spit, there was blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up. The first time the wife went to check on him, she saw him spitting up blood. It was not like his vomit was red with blood in it, it was just the after effects, so she thought she should call and report this. Each time he has vomited, there was still that spit up of blood afterwards. The patient himself clarified the vomiting was last around 4 am (06Apr2020), give or take, and the last stool/bout of diarrhea was around 7 am (06Apr2020). He was still feeling nauseous and fatigued. He added that after the first time he vomited and the couple times he checked later on, he looked in the mirror and saw that there was this redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids. He adds it was red, it wasn&#39;t like splotchy, but it was like his pores looked red, like pinpoints. The patient clarified that the fatigue and achiness probably started around the first time he vomited, and that was still hanging around. The wife stated this was better than him getting Covid. Wife added what she was trying to see was if she should take her husband to the hospital or not. She did not want to wait too long, but if this was something that was a side effect that was expected, then her husband could just sleep it off.

Breathing was a little more difficult due to these pains. The symptoms have persisted since that time, although they have been more subdued. Experienced a peak again around noon on 4/30/2021, but is milder again as I submit this.

The pain was only minimally positional and it was nonpleuritic. He drove himself to the nearest hospital and even drove through some red lights to get there more quickly.  When he arrived he had ST elevation in the same leads with his early repolarization which was perhaps a millimeter or so higher than the EKG we did in February.  He had both an elevation of his troponin levels which were 5.07, 6.06, 5.72 and 5.73.  A CK was 195 with an MB of 41.2.  He was taken to the cath lab emergently.  no coronary disease.

I rushed to him, requesting aid from his colleagues to help lay him on the ground and elevate his feet. He was unresponsive and disoriented, with shallow breathing and weak pulse, so I activated EMS @ 10:26a.  He appeared to seize again so I instructed two men to help roll him onto his side, at which time, an RN managing the vaccines, took over monitoring while I talked to 911.  EMS was on scene @ 10:29a. RN reports he&#39;d had a vagal response, most likely due to witnessed severe anxiety during IM injection (name /right deltoid @ 10:23a). RN gave him Gatorade and he quickly became AOx3.  When EMS arrived, he was able to stand up, with assist, and be placed on the gurney.  EMS monitored him for ~ 20min onsite, at which time he became hypotensive, resulting in transport to the nearest ER with O2 and IV management.  Per HR representative for a business patient was discharged @ ~2p the same day, with diagnosis of severe dehydration and hypokalemia, his reaction most likely a vagal event.  Unknown if medications were given outpatient.

When I got back to him, he was already back awake.  Fire dept was dispatched and they checked his vitals and he signed a form to go AMA to the hospital.

                                                After about 2 weeks after receiving the first vaccine, I started experiencing some chest tightness on the left side, felt increased pulse on left arm, left side chest, left side of chest.  I have not felt any pain but the chest tightness and pulse are irritating and concerning.  I still have these sensations today on 6/4, almost a month after the first vaccine.

Sometimes it gets so bad,  I have to sit down because it feels like I&#39;m going to collapse.  I have also experienced chest pains in the first month after the second shot,  but these have seemed to go away.  The tired and vertigo sensations are ongoing months after the shot.

He was not falling over but had to be very careful with his steps.; burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back; he felt off. It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux. He experienced some unusual side effects that were not listed on the web. His boss advised him to call. Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.   Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

A 34-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 20Jan2021 13:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced allergies. On 20Jan2021, the patient experienced some lightheadedness for 1-2 hours after administration and some elevated heartrate in first 15 minutes after administration.

A 34-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, Lot number EL0140, in Hospital, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 22Dec2020 (at 34 years of age) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prediabetes (glucose tolerance impaired) from an unknown date. The patient didn&#39;t have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included metformin and multivitamins. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced premature ventricular contractions, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, shortness of breath and chest pain. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care access and hospitalization as life threatening events. The patient was treated with diltiazem, fludrocortisone, aspirin and atorvastatin. He remained in hospital 2 days and then he was discharged. The patient underwent COVID-19 test (nasal swab) on 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 and both gave negative results. The patient had not recovered yet from the reported events at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events ventricular extrasystoles, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, dyspnea and chest pain cannot be excluded as the information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. The patient is a young adult with known prediabetes, but no other comorbidities reported. Information on tests done during admission, clinical course and working diagnosis would be helpful in further assessment of this case. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Pt states that he gets flushed, diaphoretic when this happens. He denies respiratory distress and pruritis. Pt was given juice and crackers. Shortly after, pt experienced another vasovagal episode. He became pale, diaphoretic, and vasovagaled.   Pt was brought on to a cot. He was given an ice pack. He stayed laying down for 15 minutes. Eventually pt was brought to sitting up position. He left and was comfortable to drive. A note was added into his chart for his second vaccine.

On 03/28/2021, I began to notice chest pain and simultaneous pain in my left arm on 03/28/2021. The fever, chills, headache, and general soreness subsided on 03/29/2021, but the periodic chest and arm pain persisted and continued to get worse. On 03/29/2021 I also had nausea/vomiting and sweating. On the morning of 03/30/2021 during an episode of chest and arm pain we went to the Emergency Department at. At the emergency department, they detected elevated troponin levels indicating damage to the heart muscle. I was rushed via ambulance for an emergency heart catheterization. I was admitted to the hospital and monitored while various other tests were performed. It was determined that there was inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis).

                                                The patient developed a sensation of seeing bright sparkly spots in his vision that lasted a brief moment.  He said that this typically happens after he gets a shot or is exposed to needles.  He then asked if he could lay himself down because he says that is what usually helps him feel better.  His SBP was measured to be in the 80s initially with a heart rate in the low 50s.  His oxygen saturation was normal.  He was given some water to drink.   After a few minutes, his heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal.  We discussed having him go to the hospital.  After our evaluation, the patient preferred to go home.  We asked that he go to the hospital if his symptoms returned.

                                                April 7, woke up with a headache, took ibuprofen. A few hours later, started feeling hazy, lightheaded and had trouble concentrating while working from home. Felt like I was going to pass out. Took a break from computer screen, symptoms appeared to subside.  An hour later, same haziness feeling came back. Thought I was going to pass out again. Called 911. ER diagnosed  me with near syncope. Told me to keep an eye on symptoms and come back if things worsen. I informed them I had received one dose of vaccine, they didn?t seem to think it was related.  Symptoms have slightly improved since, but still have bouts of dizziness four days later.

Bleeding stopped for approx. 5 mins and started a second time. Second bleed lasted approx. 6-10mins and was a medium to heavy flow (4-5 napkins). When I was able to wash out the blood a large blood slime was pulled out from my nose. All bleeding was from the right nostril.  No bleeding has occurred since (approx. 15hrs later).

                                                Within an hour of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel &#34;odd&#34; (i.e heart racing, spine tingling, strange sensations in my hands, and dizziness).  At the hour mark, while trying to &#34;walk it off&#34; inside my backyard, things escalated quickly.  As I came back inside, I suddenly collapsed and and lost consciousness.  Luckily my best friend was with me and she described my behavior as a full on seizure (which I am not predisposed to).  According to her, I was flopping around, spitting wildly and drooling all over my face, my eyes wide and glazed staring into nothing, lips turning blue.  She immediately called 911 and within 5-10 minutes, two EMT&#39;s arrived and began to speak to me and take my vitals.  For a good 15 minutes I couldn&#39;t sit up and had to lay on the ground, still extremely out of it - unable to think, merely in extreme discomfort similar to the most intense flu I&#39;ve ever experienced.  After a half hour or so, I sat up and was able to thank them for helping me and answer some of their questions.  Over another 15 or so minutes they said all my vitals were perfect and they were not worried about me - sure I&#39;d make a full recovery, which I hope I did.  I am feeling MUCH better today.  The reason I felt it so important to submit this report is because I had never heard of anyone experiencing side-effects that severe.  Of course I had heard it could wipe you out, give you chills, aches, and exhaustion - but I had never heard that it could lead to a seizure so scary that my best friend thought I might be dying.  I truly don&#39;t know what might have happened without her.  People should know to have someone at home with them after the second dose.  I am not over-exaggerating about my symptoms whatsoever.  My body still hurts all over and I feel as if I went through some type of gauntlet yesterday.  I absolutely do NOT want to discourage anyone from getting the vaccine, but I wish I had some notion that something so severe could happen to me.

Initial: Itching and burning through my neck and shoulders, and swollen lymph nodes in neck and collarbone. I began sweating at night profusely and losing weight. I have had a lot of trouble sleeping. These symptoms continued in 24-48 hour cycles of flare ups until 04/19/2021 but finally seem to be abating. Progression: secondary symptoms appeared over the course of the month such as full body joint soreness, weakness, stiffness, stabbing pains (in the neck, arms, chest, and abdomen), blood pressure spikes, dry/sore throat, dry eyes, difficulty swallowing. Symptoms are similar to arthritis or other autoimmune diseases. Night sweats continue but are lighter. Weight loss continues but slower. Sleeping remains irregular.

                                                2 hours after vaccination, I started having a bad headache.  Later, that night I started feeling my chest thumping.  The heart palpitations continued on for 2 days, after which I went to an urgent care facility.  At the urgent care I got an EKG and the doctor said my heart was beating fast and irregularly.  I then spent the next 2 days in the hospital getting intense treatment for my irregularly beating heart.  A week later I can still feel my heart beat and the headache comes and goes.

Other symptoms: lightheadedness and fatigue continuing from 1 day after vaccination. Chest pain continued; going to a clinic was advised by multiple sources. At 9:00 AM, went to a clinic and got a CKG. The CKG was normal. I concluded that the problem was chest wall inflammation, and took ibuprofen. With ibuprofen, the chest pain was mostly gone by 8:00 PM.

                                                As a clinical monitor, I was called over to assess a driver slumped over in his seat. He had just received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine approximately 10 minutes earlier. The passenger (his fiance) said he was acting normal until she heard him grunt and then realized that he was passed out.   While attempting to lay flat, I performed a jaw thrust that yielded a stridulous inspiration but was still unresponsive. He did not have a palpable carotid pulse. Paramedics was summoned emergently. Within 30-45 seconds, he awoke but was confused and amnestic to the event. He had no physical complaints and no significant medical or allergy history.   I auscultated his larynx (no stridor) and his lungs (CTA). His initial vitals: BP 90/51  HR 61  VR 16  SaO2 100% An electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm without ischemic changes or evidence of conduction delay. His glucose was 119.   Over the next 30 minutes, he was able to drink two bottles of water and some orange juice. That said, he still said he &#34;felt off.&#34; Repeat vital signs:  BP 118/62  HR 69  SaO2 100%.    The medics advised him to follow up with his doctor, preferably today. His fiance agreed to drive him to an ED near their home for a more thorough evaluation. I provided her my phone number to provide to the ED for any questions.   His clinical syndrome was consistent with a syncopal episode associated with orthostatic hypotension. Low suspicion for anaphylaxis.

                                                I was getting ready for bed (around 2am, early night for me) and suddenly felt dizzy, nauseous, and incredibly hot. I was very stressed about it and it had been six days since the shot, so I just assumed I was either having a heart attack or a really bad panic attack. I did a meditation and chewed a couple aspirin just in case.  There was extreme tightness in my chest. Breathing was difficult. The dizziness, nausea, and inability to control my body temperature went away within a couple hours and I managed to sleep. But the chest tightness and difficulty breathing persisted for about 3 or 4 days.  I also noticed it hurt more whenever I was sitting upright or forward, and it hurt almost zero when I leaned back or laid down.

                                                16 hours after my second shot, I woke up with some nausea.  I went to the bathroom, did not vomit, however in the middle of urinating I collapsed on the floor, couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t form full sentences, started sweating profusely, had to crawl back to my bed, and my pulse was through the roof.  I almost went to the ER, but the episode subsided within 15 minutes.   When I tried to fall back asleep, it felt like I was blacking out and not drifting asleep.  The next day, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms.  Followed by 4 days of normalcy.  On the 4th day, while working, I experienced a sharp 3 second &#34;electric shock&#34; feeling in my left side of my chest.   On the 5th day, I already had previously scheduled an appointment with my primary for a physical.  I told her about my episode; she took an EKG which yielded normal results.  Lab work also looked ok.  On the 6th day, I started feeling some more nausea and fatigue.  On the 7th day, the vertigo intensified tenfold, and the room was spinning.  That&#39;s when I started experiencing the following symptoms:  ? More nausea. ? Dizzy spells that come and go, especially after eating. ? Persistent periodic electric shock feeling in my left chest.  It?s dull but annoying.  And just when I think it?s gone for good, another 1 second shock happens. ? Left arm is  weak - the entire arm. ? When I try to sleep, the left side of my head feels as though I?m blacking out when I start drifting.  It almost feels like I?m getting anesthesia or something like that.  But just the left side. ? Basically the left side of my body (I got the jab in my left arm) from the waist up just feels off. ? One of my arms is numb when I wake up until I shake it out.  It?s not one particular arm. ? Energy levels are low.  Especially when I wake up and start moving around.  On the 8th day, I went to the ER thinking  perhaps it was a heart attack.  Nothing - EKG was again normal and lab work was normal.  The doctor told me it&#39;s all in my head - anxiety.  However, I&#39;m not anxious and I&#39;m a very level headed individual.    It&#39;s now day 12 and I feel overall awful.  I can&#39;t concentrate on anything.  I&#39;m not thinking clearly and forgetting simple things.  The dull feeling and electric shocks on my left side continue.  I&#39;ve never felt this bad before.  I&#39;m a healthy 34 year old that exercises regularly, has never smoked or done drugs, rarely drinks alcohol, and eats generally very healthy.  If given a second chance I would not take the covid shot.  I am praying this goes away.

A 34-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscular in Arm Left on 17May2021 (at the age of 34-years-old) (Lot Number: EW0187) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included higher than normal blood pressure, about 2-3 weeks ago, his blood pressure was very high due to really crazy stress in his life and eating terrible; headaches, smoked marijuana, drunk vodka, sometimes he had a sensitivity to needles, sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, Sometimes he got a little queasy with the sight of needles and just had a ton of dental work done. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (Generic Brand Zyrtec); caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN) taken for headaches. He explained he took Generic Brand Zyrtec which he had been on for years now and he took Excedrin for headaches when he got them. Those were basically the only medications he took really. He hadn&#39;t had any type of vaccine. He previously had a tetanus shot about 10 years ago for Immunization. There was no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine on Monday, 17May2021. Within 3-5 minutes of getting the vaccine, he had a really crazy reaction. He remembered looking at his wife and she told him he was having mild convulsions as he was sitting in the chair in May2021. He was kind of shaking in May2021. He turned ghostly white and he began sweating profusely in May2021. He mentioned that her wife said that he was not conscious for around 5 minutes and was &#34;snoring with eyes open&#34; in May2021. He added that he was &#34;fighting to stay awake&#34; for around 15-20 minutes after that. He blacked out. All he remembers was that he was trying to fight off tunnel vision for a very brief time in May2021. The pharmacist continuously checked on him. The lightheadedness and feeling like he was going to black out lasted 15-20 minutes in May2021. They put him in a chair and told him to elevate his feet, but the caller explains he could not elevate his feet. He had his feet in another chair in front of him. He couldn&#39;t get comfortable, he was sitting down. He was restless, lightheaded. He kept feeling like he was going to pass out. So, then he tried to stand up and walk a little bit. He only made it 5 steps. So, he sat on the ground and laid down. He laid on the ground, flat on his back, and put his feet in a chair, which was about 2.5 feet above him for about 15-20 minutes. He started to feel better. He still felt very tired and weak in May2021 but he was able to stand up and walk and go home. He hadn&#39;t had a reaction since. He had had no other symptoms besides just a sore arm in May2021. He confirmed he recovered completely from his experience when he was administered the vaccine. He came home from the vaccine facility, laid on the couch and watched TV for a couple of hours and then fell asleep for 3-4 hours. He was tired, but he felt completely fine. He had no lightheadedness, no dizziness. He also wanted to add sometimes he has a sensitivity to needles, but he didn&#39;t when he received the COVID vaccine. Sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, but he was actually excited to get the COVID shot. He was even comforting his wife and was telling her everything is going to be okay. He wasn&#39;t worried about the needle with the COVID shot. Sometimes, he gets a little queasy with the sight of needles, but he saw the needle and he didn&#39;t feel faint or angst when getting the shot. He just had a ton of dental work done, where he had huge needles shoved in his mouth and he didn&#39;t feel faint or anything. He really wanted to get the second shot to finish the vaccination series. He did kind of believe he had a reaction, he was not trying to play it off and say &#34;oh I got the vaccine and passed out&#34;. He knew himself and knew what it&#39;s like to faint and this experience just felt different. He believed he had a reaction. He never felt tunnel vision that strong in his entire life, it felt like being punched in the face. Since those 2-3 weeks, his stress load had gone down and he had had a drastic change in his diet, so his blood pressure was reading much better now. This past Monday, 17May2021, when he received his vaccine, his blood pressure shouldn&#39;t have been that high.  The EMT&#39;s did come before he left and because he passed out his blood pressure was low at 100/60. When providing the Lot number off of his vaccine record card, the patient explained the last digit was either a 7 or a 2, he can&#39;t read this person&#39;s handwriting&#34;, however, he eventually confirmed the number was a 7.  The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The outcome of event tired was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovered in May2021.

This physician reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of 2 reports.   A 35-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. Caller stated that his close friend who was ER physician (front line worker) and within 24 hours after receiving the COVID vaccine, developed COVID or symptoms of COVID. Patient received the COVID vaccine on 18Dec2020 and the same night patient started with a low grade fever, body aches, chills, muscle pain, shortness of breath, cough, O2 saturation of 80% (hypoxia) and was in the intensive care unit now. Patient swore this was related to the vaccine. This patient tested positive for COVID. He had a CT (computerised tomogram) scan which showed extensive infiltration in the lungs in Dec2020. Patient was admitted to the hospital on 24Dec2020 and then was moved to the ICU 2 days later, on 26Dec2020. Caller thought patient had a positive COVID test at another hospital. Caller did know that tested positive at the current hospital on 26Dec2020 which was done to confirm the previous positive test. Caller thought patient had his first positive COVID test either the same day or the next day after receiving the vaccine. Event of O2 Saturation of 80% / hypoxia was reported as hospitalization from 24Dec2020 and life threatening; infiltration in the lungs and shortness of breath caused hospitalization from 24Dec2020, muscle pain, chills and positive COVID test was reported as medically significant; and other events were reported as non-serious.  Outcome of O2 saturation of 80% / hypoxia and shortness of breath was not recovered, outcome of cough was recovering; and outcome of other events were unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested. ; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a lack of efficacy with suspected vaccine BNT162B2 in this patient cannot be completely excluded.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2020519020 same reporter/drug , different patient/AE.

                                                Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis; Slurring his speech; Stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 35-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in deltoid (unknown if right or left) on 17Dec2020 at 30 ug, single for &#39;Preventative&#39;. Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications.(Physician) He is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. States what is going on with the patient may be associated as a side effect. The patient got the vaccine two to three weeks ago, he clarifies the patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and the patient ended up acutely developing (states it is a presumptive diagnosis) Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, states it looks like a radiologic diagnosis. The patient is an employee at hospital. When querying seriousness states it is medically significant but could be disabling but he thinks the patient will recover. Reporter seriousness for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis: Medically significant, Hospitalization. Patient was hospitalized on Sunday and he is still admitted at this time. Dates when patient was in hospital for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from 03Jan2021 to ongoing. Caller thinks the patient was flown to (Place) yesterday. The patient&#39;s mother asked the caller if the caller thought the acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from the vaccine and the caller responded that he did not think it was from the vaccine. He confirms the patient is still admitted in the hospital and the patient&#39;s attending neurologist is doctor. The caller heard about the patient from doctor. When querying covid vaccine dose, the caller states the standard dose is 30 mcg. This was clarified and documented as provided. The patient has not received his second dose yet. He asks if the patient should receive the second dose. He asks a general question if a pregnant patient can be given the Pfizer covid vaccine. He heard the patient had a stroke then the CFO tried to talk to him and the patient was slurring his speech. Caller spoke to the patient&#39;s mother this morning and caller told the mother that he would try to find out what is going on with the patient.  He asked that the patient get an HIV test even though he does not think the patient is at risk. Vaccination facility type was Hospital. Vaccine administered at military facility was No. None additional vaccines administered on same date of the PFIZER suspect. AE acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis require a visit to Emergency Room, not visit to physician office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. He has heard of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis being associated with vaccines in the past and states that it is rare and usually in kids. States he saw patients that may have had acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis back in the 80s and 90s. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (Patient will get steroids tonight pending the review of the x-ray). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke with speech slurred, and the presumptive diagnosis of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (looks like a radiologic diagnosis by the reporting physician), was most likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

                                                I had the normal symptoms of pain at injection site, headache, fatigue, chills, muscle aches.  I did get a fever for a short duration.  The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

A 35-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via intramuscular on the left arm, on 21Jan2021 at 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. No history of allergic reactions to any meds (medication) in the past or other vaccines in childhood. Otherwise young healthy male with no history of hypertension. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EJ1686) via intramuscular on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 16:00 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe elevation of blood pressure. On 22Jan2021, at 12:00 AM, after the 2nd dose in left arm, after about 24 to 48 hours, the patient experienced vesicular pruritic erythematous patches in multiple locations of my left arm, left arm pit, left upper back, left chest occurred, peaking on day three and still remain after one week. The blisters have opened leaving behind painful ulcers. This is not a rash that disappears in a few days. It will take much longer than that to heal. No rash with the first dose. Also, with both doses, had severe elevation of blood pressure as high as 180/100 within 2 to 5 hours on 22Jan2021, requiring about 3 doses of clonidine over 7 days where bp would cycle up and down. The seriousness of the events was reported as non-serious. Since the vaccination, the patient has been not tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events and included Benadryl, mometasone cream and clonidine. The outcome of the events was reported as recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Had horribly body aches, was extremely flushed, tachycardic and short of breath. The respiratory distress kept increasing which is why I ended up going to the ER.

                                                I tested positive for covid on ~11/26. Relatively mild case with mild fatigue and lost of taste and smell. Possibly some worsening exercise tolerance ~3-4 weeks after initial onset date. I&#39;m not sure if it was deconditioning vs lingering covid effects.   No side effects from first covid vaccine minus a sore arm. After second dose some mild fatigue ~2 days. Then 12 days after second dose significant more fatigue and in the next few days chills at night and tachycardia with pulse in 120s at rest. No fever, pain, sob, swelling or other symptoms. Presented to immediate care on 2/27 predominantly for the tachycardia. Was referred to the ED.  Discharged on 3/1 on metoprolol with possible diagnosis of viral myocarditis.

And now happens randomly throughout the day 10 times an hour approximately mostly in arm, but also in butt and shoulder and legs. I also feel heart jolts 2-3 times an hour.  Heart rate normal 55-90 when measured this last week. Based on a chat with a friend who is a cardiologist he recommended to stop exercise and caffeine,  and that has been the case for a week now. But currently still experiencing symptoms.

He reported seasonal allergies that at times caused light headed feelings.   Patient decided he did not wish to go to ER and left with his companion. No further reports at this time

This 35- year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration, on 12Apr2021 at 09:30 am (at the age of 35-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination, in left arm. The facility where COVID-19 vaccine was administered was a hospital. No known allergies. Patient has no relevant medical history. States: I live a healthy lifestyle diet, exercise, proper rest. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 12Apr2021 10:00 am, the patient stated: I passed out and or blacked out on my drive home from the hospital. I was careful to follow the 15minute wait period before I left the hospital and was ok at that point. I had tense nerve feelings came over me as it grew so strong, I was forced to try and get my car on an off ramp to leave the highway I was on. I thankfully did not get any real injuries to my body as I spun and landed on the side of the road in the grass area. However, this experience was horrifying to say the least. I had a delayed reaction to this vaccine, other than this one incident, I really only had the typical body aches or pain for 24 hours and a bit of nerve twitching. I will not mark this as a risk of death, because it was my driving a car that risked my safety not the vaccine, however, the vaccine did cause the black out. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination.  Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

He states that he has about 30 seconds to know if he is going to pass out. His wife who was right beside the patient said he also he skin turns color as well. I gave him his vaccination. I had him sit in chair to see how he was feeling. He said he was feeling fine. I had him sit about five feet from me in supportive, armed chair. I was preparing to vaccinate his wife. We looked over and his face started turning pale and green. His wife and I immediately went to both his sides to support him and lower his head to his lap. He became conscious about 5-10 seconds later. This all occurred within 3 minutes of the administration of the shot. I gave him a drink. I continued to observe him for 15 minutes until he left. He was alert and fine when leaving the store. I called the patient&#39;s home on April 25, 2021. Patient was at work. I spoke with his wife who said he was feeling fine. I recommended he check in with his doctor regarding second shot.

Common side effects such as chills, headache and severe drowsiness lasted 2 maybe 3 days but the anxious feeling in my chest is still there. Heart palpitations is what I am having and it?s constant. There have been times at work that I can feel my heart beat in my pant legs, temples, wrists and forehead from ordinary stress that I?ve have no issues handling in the past 4 years. Every 30-60 seconds I have to take a deep breath to catch my breath regardless of what I am doing. Suddenly severe drowsiness. I?m sure there?s more that I?m forgetting.

                                                started as severe dizziness and weakness, chest pain was hospitalized once I got to the ER because my heart was not working properly, after many test the found my heart was in heart failure with an output of 35% only, was in hospital for 5 days. Doctors couldn&#39;t see what caused such a sudden weakness of the heart, they did cardio path and arteries have zero blockage, they did ECO, and a EP Study. My heart now suffers from PVCs or arrhythmia and they are very irregular and frequent. Was given medicine to help the heart and control the PVCs, and discharged with wearing a safety vest, to follow up with the cardio doctors. Followed up with doctors and they have done an MRI which shows scarring of the heart. The doctor has determined that the diagnosis is myocardiatis. There is no proof this direct relation with the vaccine,  however symptoms started soon after the vaccine in a healthy young man. Now I still have to go to another electrophysiologist to see what he can do to help alleviate the PVCs and continue to take the medication to see of the heart can improve. I could not work for a month, and still cannot resume normal activities because my heart is to weak to sustain it.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 35-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 31Mar2021 09:00 (at the age of 35-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, beta carotene, biotin, boron, calcium, calcium pantothenate, chloride, chromium, colecalciferol, copper, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, iodine, iron, lycopene, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, nicotinamide, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, silicon dioxide, thiamine, tin, tocopheryl acetate, vanadium, vitamin k nos, zinc (CENTRUM MEN). The patient previously took bactrim and experienced allergies. Historical vaccine includes BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN 6206), administered in left arm on 10Mar2021 at 08:45 AM (at the age of 35-year-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. On 27Apr2021 at 08:00 AM, the patient experienced bilateral embolisms (blood clots in lungs) and also had blood clot in left leg. Symptoms before diagnosis included dry cough, coughing up blood, chills, fever, body aches, and body pains. The events caused hospitalization. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test via nasal swab post vaccination which was negative on 29Apr2021 and on 07May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of bilateral pulmonary embolisms and had blood clot in left leg, chills, and body aches/body pains which included Lovenox injection (blood thinner) and Tylenol for pain. The patient was recovering from all events.

                                                Irregular heartbeat lasting at least one week following my second dose of Pfizer. Began around May 14 &amp; is beginning to settle as of May 23. Frequency has decreased immensely over the last few days. Was having irregular heartbeat consistently throughout the day for nearly five days straight &amp; am now only experiencing 0-1 times per day. I am currently living out of the country &amp; had returned to my home to receive my first dose of Pfizer in April. I had been home for one month before departing back on May 10th &amp; began experiencing side effects four days after my return (roughly one week after my second dose). I currently do not have a doctor to report to back home, &amp; had not yet seen my doctor here to report the irregularity. Note: I did not experience symptoms with my first shot.

Also developed constant sub-sternal chest pain.  Worse with movement or deep inspiration.  No clear positional component.   CP persisted until he came to the ED today.  Initial ECG showed concave ST elevations lateral leads.  Given his history this was felt to be most consistent with pericarditis.  He received toradol, morphine and SL NTG with near complete relief of the pain.  Repeat ECG showed resolution ST elevations.  Troponin was elevated, peak 9.08 ng/ml.

                                                Patient had fainted after receiving the vaccine and when I came to saw him, he was back on the chair. He said he felt faint. I asked if his breathing was alright, his sight and hearing was ok; he said everything was fine, but he still felt faint. Then I saw his eyes closing again and he slouched down on the chair and became unconscious. I helped him onto the ground, where he started shaking, so I rolled him onto his side. He felt clammy. It was a few seconds before he stopped shaking and opened his eyes again. I asked him to stay laying on the ground and asked him again regarding his breathing, hear rate, vision, how he felt. He asked if he passed out again and I told him yes and we&#39;re going to keep him on the ground until paramedics arrive. He said he felt better; his breathing and speech was fine, there wasn&#39;t any sound of shortness of breath, but he was sweating in cold sweats and he asked us to fan him. He said that he felt better and that he has a big phobia of needles, which his wife who was there, confirmed. He informed me that he&#39;s fainted several times at doctor&#39;s office and hospitals when they stick a needle in him. When the fire fighters arrived, they spoke to him prepared to get a EKG on him, to which he immediately told them that he doesn&#39;t want them to stick any needles in him and he became frightened that the EKG pads were needles. When paramedics came, they determined that they had to take him to the hospital because they said he wasn&#39;t able to stand up on his own without falling over and his heart rate was increasing.

                                                1st dose: within 7 minutes hot feeling throughout the body, racing hear rate up to 157 and BP 180/107. Monitored at the site with an oxymeter and bp monitor. Eventually it went back to normal and I was able to leave. The event of my heart BP and pulse rising happened multiple times during that day. Called my doctor after.  2nd dose: same event as first dose, but this time it came on almost immediately after the shot was completed. Elevated BP and heart rate. I was not getting better so I was wheeled in to the hospital where I had some testing done and released maybe 5 hours later. All heart tests were normal.   Within about a week of the 2nd dose I was at home relaxing and my heart rate went up to 150 and then back down to 59 and then back up again. I had an oxymeter on that was monitoring it and it kept fluctuating between 59-150 and I could feel it rise and drop. I was admitted to the ER then discharged. I was told it was a possible vaccine side effect. Cardiologist appointment a few weeks later where again I was told it may have been related.  Since the vaccine I have recurring episodes as detailed above. Racing heart, headaches etc.

                                                My first COVID19 Pfizer vaccine shot was on 4/05/21. My second was 3 weeks later on 4/26/21.  About 30 hours after my second vaccine on 4/27/21 I started to notice tightness around my lungs/rib cage in the intercostal muscle area. For the next few days the pain increased and I had shortness of breath as well. After a few nights I couldn&#39;t lie down to sleep because of this pain so I had to sit upright to sleep.   On 5/3/21 I went to the doctor at hospital where I was examined and had a lung X-ray as well as a COVID PCR test (it was negative). The PA diagnosed me with &#34;Pneumonia&#34; and I was given antibiotics (cefuroxime and azithromycin) to take for 6-7 days.  I started feeling a little better by 5/6/21 and actually reported here on VAERS with my diagnosis of suspected Pneumonia. On 5/17/21 I had another lung x-ray at hospital and was told my lungs were looking more clear. However, for the next 2 weeks I felt more tired and my poor breathing, a cough with bloody mucus, and more chest/rib cage area pain developed. Despite being a professional runner it became hard to walk up a flight of stairs without breathing really hard and feeling light-headed.   On  5/30/21 I woke up with fairly intense chest pain just under my heart. I was taken to the ER at second Hospital and got a CT scan with contrast that showed a bilateral Pulmonary Embolism with infract. An ultra sound of my heart (normal) and blood panels were performed as well as multiple EKGs. I was given a stomach injection of Lovenox also. That afternoon I was transferred to third Hospital. for overnight monitoring with more EKGs and Lovenox injections. Prescribed blood thinner Pradaxa for 3 months with no known cause of clots that caused this Pulmonary Embolism. Kidney test and Heart appeared normal. Still waiting on genetic testing. Lung infract has caused lasting chest pain and my breathing has yet to return back to normal.

He lost consciousness but was making snorting/snoring noises and was having muscle contractions that left him rolling around in his chair. This lasted about 2 minutes. He then turned very red and it appeared that he wasn&#39;t breathing. I removed his facemask and yelled his name/patted his chest and he began to regain consciousness. He sat for several minutes and said he felt fine.

I stopped and walked- it dropped to 168 so I slowed down and it spiked again.  With any exercise since vaccine my heart rate has been elevated.  I have had heart palpitations- two days after the vaccine and blood pressure was high for me.  Blood pressure is not back down but still slightly higher than usual- I have slowed my normal exercise routines down but I am experiencing tightness in chest.

Led to development of pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology, atrial flutter, and subsegmental pulmonary embolism. Workup of other causes of pericardial effusion (e.g., infection, malignancy, autoimmune), and hypercoagulability were otherwise negative. 2nd dose of vaccine was on 1/4/2021 and pericardial effusion was diagnosed and evacuated on 2/14/2021. Patient hospitalized from 2/14/2021-2/17/2021. Patient is also healthcare provider.

Woke up morning of 2/19 and observed extensive petechiae and bloody nose consistent with low platelet count and ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura). I was previously diagnosed with ITP and platelet count was 262k confirmed by blood work a couple days before 2nd vaccine. Morning after got blood draw confirming platelets dropped to below 1k. Medical emergency and sent to ER. Admitted and received emergency treatment to increase platelet counts. Ended up requiring splenectomy on 2/22/21. Just discharged from hospital. Multiple medical providers advised me to submit report to VAERS.

                                                Pt received the covid vaccine around 12:50 pm.  Then as he was walking to schedule his second appointment soon after the vaccine, he fell to his knees (no CHI).  I was notified and ran over to see pt was disoriented, pale, diaphoretic.  While measuring his left arm BP (80/30), he began to convulse with both elbows flexed.  The convulsions lasted about 10 secs, pt did not recall the event, we held him in a seated position on the floor.  He felt much better after the convulsion &#43; water/snacks, however we did call EMS during the event.  Per EMS, BP was 128/80, and pt was AAOx3.  Pt refused to go to the hospital and agreed to f/up with PCP.

Patient briefly lost consciousness  for approximately 30 seconds and complained of severe nausea following the incident.  After recovering, he stated that he has a history of vasovagal syncope and usually receives injections lying down.   He described tingling sensation of hands and feet, nausea, and was perspiring.  Patient had gatorade and water and tried to eat crackers before complaining again of nausea.  Observed him for about 20 minutes at which point he was still complaining of nausea but was able to ambulate unassisted and left with his nurse wife.  Checked in with him three hours later and he stated that he was feeling better.

                                                Onset began with a flushing/warmth feeling in the right side of face about 35 minutes after injection, with itching on the roof of the mouth accompanied by feeling of swelling in the area. This was followed by a spread of the flush/warm feeling across the face, chest and arms followed immediately by a 2-3 minute panic feeling, chest tightness and extremely heightened anxiety with a general feeling of being unable to focus/concentrate. After this couple of minutes the flushing stopped in all areas except the cheeks and the itching sensation dissipated quickly over the next 30 minutes but the feeling of swelling on the roof of the mouth continued for a total of one hour. There were no visible signs of swelling in the mouth, tongue or throat, nor redness in the face. The flushing feeling settled in both cheeks of the face and was accompanied by heightened anxiety, along with an overall feeling of being warm. However, there were no visible signs of redness or rash, the sensations and anxiety persisted for mildly for 10 hours, all of which gradually dissipating over time. That night physical symptoms had cleared up, soreness in the right arm began and lasted into the morning. Anxiety levels mostly returned to normal in the morning.

His eyes started rolling into the back of his head and he was exhibiting shallow breaths. His pupils dilated and he started foaming at the mouth. Pt was lowered to the ground and a full dose of adult epi pen (Lot#0FM406 Exp FEB 2022) was given to the left lateral thigh at 1725. 911 was also called. Pt came to almost immediately. His pupils and breathing returned to baseline. He stayed lying down but was A &amp; O x4. He confirmed that he does not have any allergies, however he has passed out after a vaccine before. Paramedics arrived on scene and took over the encounter. Pt felt much better, however still went with the Paramedics to the ER. Also advised pt to follow up with his PCP in regards to receiving the second vaccine.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

At approx 1540 this nurse was called over by a staff member and was told that this patient was feeling dizzy, hot and nauseous. This patient presented as diaphoretic and pale.  RN&#39;s, came over to the patient and began asking basic demographic info questions, and started to measure his vital signs. This patient denied any heart issues or past medical history. His father was present and was seated next to the patient. We had the patient move onto a cot and we had the patient lay down and we elevated his feet. The patients initial vital signs were: 110/70, HR 56 and O2 99% at 1543. He stated that he felt some shortness of breath but was able to speak to us without difficulty. No wheezing or rhonchi present. We kept the patients legs elevated and provided a cold pack to his head and neck. After approx 10 minutes the patient stated he felt better, but he felt cold and his legs and upper body were shaking. Once we sat him up into a sitting position he stated he wasn&#39;t feeling dizzy. We kept him there for another 10 minutes until he felt better. His vital signs were measured again and his bp was 140/90, HR 91 and O2 level was 99%. The patient denied any difficulty breathing. This nurse advised for the patient and his father to go to the Emergency Room if another episode of this occurs. The patient understood and he walked with his father to their car without any difficulty.

                                                I had the 1st shot on Wednesday March 10th. On Sunday the 14th, just before going to bed at about 11pm, I went to pee. The urine was very dark brown. Didn&#39;t appear to have any red for blood. The next day I felt like water was being retained and it felt that I couldn&#39;t empty the bladder and pee was coming out slower than usual. Late Monday the 15th before bed I peed another dark brown urine and a red blood clot came out. At that point I became very concerned and sent to see the doctor on the 16th. Referred to a kidney specialist for March 31st. Between March 14th to March 29th , somedays I felt like I was retaining water, most days felt like I couldn&#39;t empty my bladder with slow flow. With the recent news of the concerns of blood clots with vaccines, I felt that I should report this.

A 36-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: Em9810, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 08Feb2021 at 09:30 (age at vaccination was 36 years) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The facility where most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was other. Medical history included type 1 diabetes, asthma and allergy to sulfas. Concomitant medications included aspart (FIASP INSULIN), minerals nos, vitamins nos (CENTRUM), vitamin d nos and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC); the patient received all these within 2 weeks of vaccination, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) administered in right arm on 18Jan2021 at 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EI3302) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient was type 1 diabetic. On 08Feb2021 at 20:00 patients blood sugar was slightly elevated (170mg/dl) 12-24h post injection and severely elevated (200-270mg/dl) 24-32h after injection. More significantly his body was insulin resistant during that time. At time of writing, it was 35h past injection and blood sugar has normalized and insulin again started behaving normally. The event was reported as non-serious with no seriousness criteria (Results in death / Life threatening/ Caused/prolonged hospitalization/ Disabling/Incapacitating/ Congenital anomaly/birth defect). The outcome of the events was recovered/resolved in 2021.

The patient was hospitalized for admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident) on 08Apr2021 in ICU currently/still as of 11Apr2021, not yet recovered. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 18Mar2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 08Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident). A 36 year old brother in law of my friend. He had symptoms of an illness (perhaps covid like symptoms) starting on 19Mar2021 (between his 1st &amp; 2nd dose of Pfizer BioNTech). He went ahead and got his 2nd dose on 21March2021. He then went to see his dr in the last week (week of 05Apr2021 I believe) because of not being well. That primary care dr thought the patient had perhaps been exposed to covid between the 1st &amp; 2nd doses (due to symptoms that the dr thought seemed like body&#39;s over-reaction to covid) but a covid test was done and it was negative. Then the patient has been admitted to (Hospital name) in (city name) (state name) suffering from a stroke on 08Apr2021. He still has not tested positive for covid (again) but he is in ICU at (Hospital name) with stroke symptoms. This was all related to my by the sister-in-law (my friend (name)).

The outcome of the event for illness was unknown and for stroke was not recovered.  Information about Lot/batch number is requested.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                4 days after the first shot I was feeling very very dizzy.   My ears felt full enough that I thought maybe they were just full of wax.  I bought an over the counter ear cleaning kit.  That didn&#39;t relieve any symptoms.  I never get headaches, but a couple days later the front top of my head was throbbing.  The area just above my forehead.  It was not sinus pressure, my face didn&#39;t feel any pressure or pain.  My throat also felt like I was being slightly choked.  Not my airway, but just my jugulars.  It began in the evenings.  It would feel like I had been hanging upside down for a while.  My head felt full of blood, like it was going to pop, like my eyes were bugging out.  By a week to 10 days later, my upper arms felt weak, my toes were tingling, and my heart would flutter for just a few seconds occasionally.  I was still dizzy, still felt like I was choking, except I was feeling this way all the time now.  The symptoms only seemed to be staying the same or getting worse.  I have NEVER gone to the doctor on my own in my life to get something checked, but this had me disconcerted enough to check in and see if I should get my second shot at all.  My appointment was to see my doctor was the morning of the same day I was scheduled to get my second Pfizer shot.  My doctor had not heard of these symptoms being associated with the Pfizer shot and chalked my symptoms up to stress.  I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of &#34;waiting to see what happens&#34; if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.  But I accepted the explanation and took the second shot that day anyway.  It should be noted that the second shot made my left armpit swell up quite a bit.  I did feel dizzy again, but not nearly as much.  The other symptoms seemed to not be as bad either.

                                                Around 2 weeks after receiving the first vaccine dose, I woke in the middle of the night gasping for air. My heart was racing and I was so weak that I could barely sit up. The following day I could not get out of bed. I also had an intense headache, which is unusual for me since I never get headaches. On the 3rd day I developed dizziness/vertigo. Since those events occurred, I&#39;ve been dizzy 24/7 and had about 25-50% of my normal energy. I cannot drive, I cannot work, I cannot many of my normal daily activities. This has been devastating. It has been over 3 weeks now with these symptoms, and I will probably lose my job this week. I don&#39;t know where to turn. There should have been a safety net for these things.

                                                On  04/26/2021 felt short breathlessness and dizziness. also Blood pressure is elevated and in between 150-160. Heart rate was also high. Immediately went to ER to check. Was treated for palpitation and dehydration. Felt normal after couple of days.  I took second dose on 05/06/2021. I felt normal for about a week. After that i started feeling heavy or pressure in my head and also dizziness. For past one week I&#39;m feeling acid reflux and heartburn. Considering i had history of acid reflux I never had this issue for past few years. I&#39;m not sure if my GERD issues are induced by vaccine. I&#39;m having controlled diet with fruits and veggies but i still have  heartburn and frequent burps. Also my Blood Pressure is still elevated around 130-140 and feeling tired and pressure in my head even now after  18 days of taking 2nd dose. I had consulted my physician on 05/20/2021, and she prescribed a medicine to take only when my blood pressure is above 140.   Just to summarize, I still have dizziness and occasionally elevated BP and acid reflux, heartburn/burps. This is impacting my day to day home and office works

Dr. suggested I go to the ER if I felt worse. I did feel some better after hearing from him. He said he was not to concerned about it, he didn&#39;t think it was my heart.

                                                It has now been more than 1 week since vaccination.  First couple of days were fine, but starting  26-FEB-2021, I&#39;ve been exhibiting all of the following: Fever - Friday 98, Saturday (3 measures over 5 hours) 99.1, 99.3, 99.4, Sunday 98.5, Monday 99.4 (at night, work up in body aches), Tuesday(97.5), Wednesday 98.5 Chills - mild, 1-3 times. comes and goes through past week.  Occurs more at night.  Feeling cold - wearing sweat pants, two shirts, long sleeve shirt, sweater, during sleep.  Constantly add/remove clothes to regulate temperature. During day, have sweat pants &#43; sweater on 78&#43; degree weather. Muscle pain - in back, moving daily. First started in right chest and back right shoulder, has now disappeared.  Now in middle of back, around spin area, hard and uncomfortable to sleep, taking IB profin helps alleviate pain, 2 to 3 tables over counter.  pain in throat around vocal box, could be due to sneezing, slight soreness to touch/aches. Feeling unwell - comes and goes, day starts fine, then around noon/1pm i get super tired and sleep.  Sleeping schedule is generally 10PM to 6AM &#43; naps through day Lose stools - from 25-FEB to 27-FEB, cleared up on 29-FEB Coughing - started on 03-MAR-2021, slight about 1 to 3 times an hour. Headache - comes and goes, use IB profin only when trying to sleep, all other times i let it be.  Good news: No swelling at injection site No redness at injection site  No Swelling at injection site  Final notes: Just feeling up an down, not taking anything besides IB profin for pain management. I was going to work everyday pre-shot with out issue. Post-shot, not feeling well enough to report to work out of fear of spreading anything that i got. Weekend immune system. Slightly grumpy demeanure since sick and interrupted sleep patterns.

                                                I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at about 4:05 or 4:10 PM today (Wed, Mar 3, 2021). Right away I had the following symptoms briefly: chills and blurred vision. Around 4:20 or so I left in my vehicle. Shortly after, I had a few chills. I needed to use the restroom and pulled into a gas station. After starting to go the bathroom, I quickly began to feel warm and my vision began to blur. The next thing I knew, I opened my eyes laying on the bathroom floor. I then left the restroom and headed to my vehicle where I noticed I had perspiration on my forehead and was really warm.  Over the next hour or so I experienced chills frequently. They have since subsided.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

I ended up with fever of 102 by 11:00 or midnight; chills and burning up and what prompted me to call my doctor, in the middle of the night, I have a watch with heart rate monitoring and it had woken me up with signal of abnormal heartrate. It was over 130 (normal rate is between 55 and 60 during sleep ) and I had a telemed visit and Dr. said to take Ibuprofen after 24 hour mark. The only other side affect, my bladder side was feeling small and I had to pee every hour. Ibuprofen helped break the fever. The symptoms were resolved by about the following night. My stress level measured by my watch was back in the normal range after I woke up the second morning.

I have never had an allergic reaction, so didn?t pay much attention to it. After returning home I became severely lightheaded and almost passed out. I immediately took a Benadryl and Motrin. Then my heart rate shot up to 160BPM according to my smart watch and maintained that for around 5 minutes. The home medicine helped it to subside, but the same feelings would return in moderate waves. By 2pm, I decided I should seek professional help and was taken to the ER by a family member. By this time I had moderate chest and jaw was very tight. At the ER I was monitored for 1 hour and then given an IV injection of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron(steroid). I immediately get relived and well. I was released from the ER around an hour later and sent home with a prescription of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone Oral Steroid. I have since had a few different side effects like chest pain, extremely flushed face, and low grade fevers. The medicine taken at home immediately stopped the face flushing.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EL9267) on 26Feb2021 and the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EN6202) on 12Mar2021, via an unspecified route of administration on Left Arm at single  dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The administration of first dose of BNT162B2 resulted in Palpitations, dizziness, hyperhidrosis and Syncope the same day of administration. Relevant medical history included allergy to penicillin.  Relevant concomitant medications included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE). During second dose of vaccine the patient stated that he feels the medicine in his body, almost to his toes. The patient was fine for a minute or two but then he reported a big rush of the room spinning, struggling to catch my breath, racing heart. EMS personnel was called over and they monitored my heart rate. It was swinging from 120&#43; BPM to 50 BPM in an instant and during the low BPM was when he passed out.   The patient was treated with Epinephrine due a potential reaction and transported to hospital.  The reported events were feeling abnormal, vertigo, dyspnoea, palpitations, heart rate irregular and loss of consciousness. All events were serious as hospitalization and Life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).

At approx. 11:10am (40 minutes after injection) I started to feel tightness in my chest and developed moderate wheezing. I immediately took two puffs of my albuterol sulfate HFA inhaler. The wheezing stopped after I used the inhaler. I did not need to use my epi injector but it was definitely anaphylaxis based on prior experience. I did not report this to the vaccination site as I had already left. It is now 12:45pm and I feel fine.

                                                I developed  a bloody nose after both vaccine injections.  The first vaccine I received was on 3/4/21 and had a bloody nose in my left nostril around 3-4 hours after the injection.  It seemed odd as I do not typically have bloody noses.  When I got  my second dose today I received another bloody nose roughly 30 minutes after the vaccine.   Both times the bloody nose happened after lightly blowing my nose.  Again, I very rarely suffer bloody noses.  I currently am not bleeding anywhere else and the nose bleeds stopped after about 10 minutes.

He did not go to ER and stayed another 20 minutes until he felt okay to leave with his girlfriend.

                                                12 minutes post vaccination, the patient was sitting down and attempted to stand up to tell the observing health care staff that he was feeling &#34;woozy.&#34; When he stood up, the patient fainted and fell to the ground. He appeared to be unconscious for 5-10 seconds and then came to. While he was confused for a few minutes, he was able to orient himself to place, time, and date. No treatment was administered. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was monitored throughout recovery time.

                                                I received my second shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, March 20th at noon.  Saturday at midnight, I woke up in full body sweats and aches.  I took two ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep, but I would toss and turn in full body sweats and aches for the next 8 hours.  I took another 2 ibuprofen around 400am.  Sunday morning I woke up feeling OK, not great, but OK.  Sunday night ? it was very strange ? the full body chills and aches came back.  Not as bad as Saturday night, but they returned nevertheless.  I had another restless night of sleep, and I took another two rounds of ibuprofen to try and help me sleep.  Monday I woke up feeling OK again.  Monday evening, around 8:00pm, I could feel the full body chills and aches coming back again, creeping up slightly.  This time, I also felt a mild burning in my upper chest and throat.  I went to bed around 8:00pm, then woke up at 9:00pm, this time in a lot of pain.  It felt like burning and a stabbing sensation in my throat and upper chest.  I took some ibuprofen, and tried to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned in agony for the next few hours, apparently falling asleep at some point around 1:00am.  At 2:00am I woke up in severe pain again.  It was very bad, like an 8 out of a 10.  It felt like a burning and stabbing sensation in my lower throat and upper chest.  I had my wife call 911, and I was brought to hospital in an ambulance.  I would stay in the hospital for the next 3 days, getting discharged Thursday at around 5:00pm.  I had peak troponin levels of 5, so I basically had a moderate heart attack.  I had a cardiac catherization procedure done, as well as a cardiac MRI.  The cardiac catherization procedure showed I had no blockages at all in my arteries.  The cardiologists diagnosed me with myocarditis.  The cardiologists told me they believe the vaccine triggered a heavy response from my auto immune system.  The response from my auto immune system in turn caused my heart to become inflamed, giving me myocarditis.  It was a horrible experience, and my doctors are convinced that it was brought on by the second coronavirus vaccine shot that I received.

                                                A few days after the shot, my lower back really started to hurt. So much, that I ended up in the ER thinking it could be kidney stones. ER staff were unable to determine the cause of the pain. Exactly one week after the shot (Tuesday), I start sweating profusely and nearly passing out at work. A day later (Wednesday), my heart rate went through the roof and I was dizzy, out of breath. By Friday night I was in an urgent care clinic with a resting heart rate of 145BPM. (My normal is in the 50s). I was diagnosed with Arterial Fibrillation. I have no history, or family history of heart issues. I run 3-5 days a week....3-10 miles at a time. In the military...very healthy.

Within 5-6 minutes of leaving the room, pt presented with pallor, sweating, dizziness, light-headedness.  We gave him a bottle of cold water to drink and a cold rag and an ice pack to use on his neck. We checked in with him every 3-4 minutes to make sure he was still doing ok and starting to feel better. After about 15-20 minutes, the color began to come back in his face and the sweating and dizziness subsided. He contacted his wife (he has a history of this type of reaction) and she came to pick him up about 27 minutes after the administration of the vaccine.  He walked out of our store on his own without help.

Had to diarrhea over 30 times in one day, throw up several times. Went to emergency room for treatment. IV treatment plus anti naseau and anti cramping   Medication. Cramping was severe in upper intestine. Symptoms have decreased, but still linger after 2 weeks of 2nd shot.  Concern if side effects are permeant. I still very tired/fatigued,  have cramping, dirahaha, throwing up, aches muscles and joints- not feeling like myself and regret taking the vaccine if it results in lifelong side effects.

A 37-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered on arm right on 13Apr2021 17:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0151) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had history of depression and allergies with prednisone and penicillin. Concomitant medications included sertraline (SERTRALINE) taken for an unspecified indication and therapy dates and serum allergy shots. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. On 13Apr2021 21:00,  the patient had flu like symptoms. He also started to feel lots of anxiety and frustration. He felt aggressive and had difficulties thinking clearly. He became confrontational with his partner and ended up jumping out of the moving vehicle, at a slow speed. He did have a long day, but he felt like irritability was a big factor. He also had issues breathing with his lungs and felt like his heartbeat was a little bit off. He did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination and not tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events and recovered in 2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm, at the age of 37 years, on Apr2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included brain tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. On 09Apr2021, the patient stated, &#34;I am undergoing immunotherapy treatment for a brain tumor. My doctors recommended I take the vaccine 2 weeks following my most recent treatment (administered every 4 weeks). Several hours after receiving the vaccine, the right side of my body was very weak and my balance was off. These symptoms went away by the next morning. 5 days later they came back and progressed. Ultimately, I went to the emergency room having trouble walking, using my right arm and staying balanced. All tests (MRIs, ultrasound, CT scan, extensive bloodwork, and more) proved that there were no apparent causes. Ultimately, it was concluded that I had a stroke and the vaccine was likely the main contributor. I am 37, in shape, and eat extremely well.&#34;  The patient was hospitalized for the events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: there were no apparent causes, computerised tomogram: there were no apparent causes, magnetic resonance imaging: there were no apparent causes, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 15Apr2021 and ultrasound scan: there were no apparent causes on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures (Aspirin prescription, Castor, physical therapy) were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A 37-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 19Feb2021 13:00 [also reported as 26Feb2021 12:45 PM] (Lot Number: EL9267; Expiration Date: May2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included drug penicillin allergies and low testosterone ongoing since 2018. Concomitant medication included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE) for low testosterone, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin but had allergies. The patient reported that a few minutes after his first vaccination (19Feb2021), he experienced a racing heart, dizziness, sweating, and almost felt like fainting.

A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

Reporter stated after the first dose of COVID 19 vaccine, her husband was pretty much out of it, like completely out of it. She was concerned and was like &#34;are you going to wake up today?&#34;. The fatigue was very real and then his neck was super swollen on one side. and said that was the only side effects from the first one, it was nothing horrible. She confirms the fatigue was either 2 or 3 days after her husband received the first dose of the vaccine and it lasted a good 3 to 4 days where he was beyond fatigued. His neck being super swollen started pretty soon after the first dose, either the next day or 2 days later and lasted for a week or so was really sore when he touched it.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, May 18, 2021 at 1:53pm EDT. Many of the &#34;typical&#34; or &#34;expected&#34; side effects commenced about 12 hours later, including chills, night sweats, a slight fever (99.5), and headache and lethargy the following day.   Nothing was particularly off-putting until the afternoon of Wednesday, May 19, 2021, when I noticed small red spots on my legs and feet. A Google search suggested petechiae and enough cause for me to go to a nearby urgent care clinic. The petechiae were present on both legs and feet (and eventually a few spots on my hands), though a little more pronounced on the left side (with one noteworthy cluster on my left leg). I had no apparent gum bleeding or bruising (maybe one bruise, but the urgent care doctor thought it was there beforehand).  The doctor at the urgent care clinic confirmed petechiae and ran stat blood work for return that night. At ~9pm EDT on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, I received a phone call from the urgent care&#39;s centralized lab informing me that my platelet count was 2 (10^3/uL) -- dangerously low, with risk of spontaneous bleeding and in the worst case scenario brain hemorrhage -- and my PTT was 55.6 seconds. They told me to report to an emergency room immediately, the nearest of Medical Center.  The diagnosis was eventually Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). Every physician I&#39;ve encountered has felt that the occurrence one-day post-vaccination points to the vaccine as the cause. (For what it&#39;s worth, I do not think any of the doctors or nurses I encountered had never seen a platelet count so low. Most of them said as much.) My discharge papers officially note as the diagnoses: petechiae, thrombocytopenia, and adverse effect of vaccine.  I have included details related to my platelet count, treatment course, and other figures below (and am happy to provide corroborating information where appropriate). The doctors did not run any d-dimers, PF4 HIT ELISA, or fibrinogen tests, and no imaging was performed, presumably because I did not present with any signs of simultaneous clotting (e.g., TTP or VITT). They&#39;ve also told me that my haptoglobin and hemoglobin levels were normal (see below), which I am told helps support the notion that there was / is no clotting or &#34;red blood cell breakdown.&#34;  Search terms: decreased platelet count, immune thrombocytopenia, ITP, severely low platelet count, low platelets, petechiae, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia, vaccine-induced ITP

                                                He got his vaccine, and was okay.  The next day was tired, drowsiness and missed a day of work, and was able to work after that.  He        was supposed to get his 2nd vaccine on 5/21/21 and had to go out of town and was going to get it when he got back.  The next day 5/23/21 at 12:00 AM his throat began to swell up and gradually it moved from his throat to his chest area.  He went to the ER on 5/23/21 in Hospital and they looked at his throat, gave him a steroid shot and some antibiotics and sent him home.  The next morning he drove back to home and continued taking the antibiotics that they prescribed and his throat kept swelling more and more.  On Tuesday 5/25 at 1:00 PM he went to the ER and sat there 8 hours without being seen and decided to leave.  The next morning 5/26/21 he went to an UC and they sent him to an ER at Hospital and from there he was sent to another ER by ambulance to have emergency throat surgery.  He had surgery on  5/27/21 at the Hospital where he had an abscess on the inside of his throat that caused his throat to swell.  He had swollen lymph nodes and to release the pressure and fluid in his throat as his neck and chest were swelled up.   He was discharged on 5/31/21.  He is now recovering from the surgery and getting better.  He lost 30# as he was not able to eat and did not have an appetite until he came home and eating a little bit better now.   He goes back to his doctor on 6/15/21 to get the stitches removed from his neck.

He woke up his mother at 5:40, came to his mothers room and said that he was shaking, and mother noticed that he was, trembling.  She asked what was wrong and he said that he could not stop shaking and his chest was hurting.  She set him down in a chair and she got the autometer to check his BP and oxygen, and his BP was 134/98, and his 02 was 96, heart rate 86.  She felt him to see if he was having a fever, it was 98.4.  She told him to sit for a little while and waited about 10 minutes, she checked his BP again at 6:00 AM, and it was 139/102, he said that he was feeling really dizzy, his head started hurting real bad.  He said that he had a bad taste in his mouth.  She just monitored him, and his 02 was still 96, heart rate was still good.  He stayed in her room until 6:15 and she got up and told him if he got worse she would take him to the ER.  At 6:25 she gave him two 500 mg of Tylenol tablets and sat him in a recliner.  At 7:30 his head was still hurting, but he was not shaking, and she gave him some yogurt and water.  He stated that he started feeling better and around 7:40 he went back up to his room and went back to sleep.  He has been ok since then.

I received my second shot on Feb 23, 2021 and had a headache/ minor migraine two days later. By the next day I was alright. On approximately May 4, 2021 (I can&#39;t recall the exact date) I briefly experienced light pain in my chest while using an under-desk elliptical at work. I am in good shape and that has never happened before. I last had an ECG in October 2020 during a physical for my job, and there were no issues at the time. The pain lasted four about a half hour and then subsided. Exactly one week later on the afternoon of May 11, I experienced the pain again at work while sitting at my desk, but that time for approximately ten minutes. I have not experienced any further pain and never saw a  doctor concerning the pain.

                                                It started as a mild pain in the center of my chest that was made much worse by leaning forward or laying down. Felt I could only stand. I vomited, I believe from the pain after I tried getting on my hands and knees. Once, I realized I could only stand upright I did. Pain lasted for about an hour. Also, I chewed an aspirin but not sure if that helped. I felt fine after standing for a while and continue to feel fine more than 24 hrs later. Also, I&#39;ll add that I&#39;ve had acid reflux before and this wasn&#39;t that.

                                                Around early April, about a week and a half after my second vaccine shot, I started to experience very bad pain in the left and surrounding area of my chest. I noticed my heart seemed like it was racing quickly, and while sleeping, it would wake me up at various times.  I went to ER to make sure I wasn&#39;t having a heart attack, and while my vitals appeared normal, the pain and racing continued at various times. I went to see a cardiologist as well as my PCP.  At the time, no one acknowledged that the vaccine was related to it the symptoms. As a young, healthy male, who exercises and workouts and never experienced chest pain before in my entire life. It is now June and adverse symptoms still linger.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

On 12/25,   seven days after  receiving the  shot  I started to get right lower leg pain and I kept complaining about it till New Years Day. I had no symptoms of a DVT.  I triaged on 1/1/21 and the doctors  ordered  labs/imaging  and the results were  as followed: D-Dimer  biomarker  (&#43;) , Ultrasound of the Rt lower leg ( - ) ,  CTA showed a PE (segmental right upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus). I  was discharged on  Xarelto and advised to follow  up with a hematologist. On 1/5/2021,  I went to hematology and they did a whole bunch of labs. I was sent to get a  ultrasound   of the leg because the pain persist and they found  a clot hidden by my soleus. The plan is to continue on the Xarelto for 6 months. Come back in 3 weeks to scan my leg again and get my lab results.  On 1/12/2021, I received the 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccination.

Got up in the night to check on my kids, had been standing for about 2-3 minutes when symptoms started, and passed out in the hallway about 60 seconds after symptom onset.  Recovered consciousness within a few seconds, had to lay on the floor for about 5 minutes due to nausea, then got back in bed and went back to sleep.  Woke up 3 hours later and felt completely fine except a little fatigue - all other symptoms had resolved.

A 38-years-old male patient started to receive 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142, Expiry Date: 01Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 30Dec2020 18:17 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was reported as &#39;None&#39; and AEs following prior vaccinations was reported as &#39;None&#39;. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was reported as None. The patient experienced really bad chills, body aches, fever, unable to sleep on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, passed out on bathroom floor for 5-10 seconds, sweating and neck was stiff on 01Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, headache on an unspecified data with outcome of unknown.  Details were as follows: the patient received the Covi-19 vaccine 30Dec2021. He had a reaction to the vaccine. 24 hours after getting the vaccine he had really bad chills, body aches, fever 100.4. He didn&#39;t take any medication for a bit. He then took acetaminophen (TYLENOL). He had a headache, he was unable to sleep. The acetaminophen worked and he went to bed. At 5:00 am he started having a bad headache and took Ibuprofen. He woke up to go to the bathroom. He passed out for 5-10 seconds in the bathroom. His head was leaning in the wall by the door. He was sweating and was stiff all over. He went to the Emergency Room on 01Jan2021. They did an X-ray and a CT scan. They gave him 100ml of saline and some pills. They also did some lab work. Everything was negative. They assumed his body couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. He was supposed to have received the second shot yesterday (20Jan2021). Employee Health said his Primary Care Physician would have to make the decision on him taking it or not. His doctor said he would have to do more research with Pfizer before he says if he can take it or not. Emergency Room visit required due to event passing out.

The worst occurred the day after when my body could no longer absorb insulin. I increased my basal rate by almost 400% and could not bring my sugars down. Saturday afternoon I began experiencing symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis: stomach pain, vomiting, high ketones and very high  blood sugars. I was able to eventually take in enough water to lower my ketones and sugar and narrowly avoided going to the ER, but high blood sugars and headache have persisted and I am still experiencing these symptoms.

He inquired about having his blood pressure taken.  His blood pressure at this time was 193/111.  I gave him some water and discussed next steps.  He agreed to remain in the Observation room to see if the water helped, and if trying to relax would help his symtoms.  Patient has a history of high blood pressure.  After an additional 30 minutes of observation, his blood pressure was taken again and this time it was 199/127.  At this time, he agreed to be seen in the ER for an assessment by the ER physcian.  At this time, his care was turned over to the ER staff.

I was initially able to walk from the area where the injection was administered about 50 yards to the observation area. Sat down &amp; shortly thereafter could feel myself getting woozy. I laid my head back &amp; closed my eyes hoping to avoid it. I was given two epinephrine shots the second of which woke me up. Several medical staff were around me when I opened my eyes. I was taken to the patient wing and checked into my own room for observation for a few more hours. Blood was drawn and sent off for a Triptase test which came back negative a couple days later. After being kept under observation for a few hours I was release around noon. I have a history of problems with shots/needles. Haven&#39;t actually passed out from it in over 20 years, but it is a known problem.

                                                Patient received his pfzier covid vaccine.  immediately after he had the vaccine administered, he stated that he started to feel very hot, dizzy, nausea and tingling down his arm that he received the vaccine in.  We immediately got a yoga mat, asked the patient to remove his shirt.  He fell to the ground.  We placed a cold pack under his head around the neck area and cold paper towels on his head.  We took his blood pressure it was 136/88.  He started to mention his chest hurting.  His past medical history includes fainting in the past (due to low blood sugars) and open heart surgery as a child.  He is currently under the care of a cardiologist.  More recently he has had several fainting spells which he believes is due to low blood sugar.  He stated he had eaten a good lunch around 11:30.  It was about 2:30 when this incident occurred.  We offered the patient, a banana, orange, chicken sandwich and water.  He ate the orange.  We called EMS.  When they arrived, they checked his blood sugar which it was 95.  He started to feel better and his wife drove him to the cardiologist.

Later that night after going to bed he woke up w/ his muscles and nerves twitching and tingling.  He says you can sometimes see the muscles spasms and then other times he feels it tingling under the skin. Pt is still having these symptoms. He had a sore arm for about 48 hours. For about 3 to 4 days he had a faster heart rate and higher blood pressure than normal.   He developed a headache that lasted about 2 days.  Currently he is having some brain fog  and his shoulder and biceps still have a heavy feeling like they are detached from his body along with the muscle twitching and tingling.  He does not feel like these symptoms are improving and will see his PCP on 3/29/2021.

                                                About 30-40 minutes after the shot, I became extremely light headed, followed shortly by chest tightness.  So much so that I pulled over my car on the side of the road, used my inhaler that I very rarely use.  I also went to a store to get some caffeine, thinking it may help with my dizziness.  I was going to call the nurse line, but started getting better about an hour later.     My allergist has advised me not to get the 2nd shot.

Prescribed Motrin 200mg and Famotidine 20mg that reduced discomfort. Pt was cleared to return to work with no current sx.

                                                Hey guys, just a heads up if you know anyone with a CPAP machine who just received a second dose of the vaccine.   I received the shot on Friday.  No reaction all day.  No reaction all day Saturday.  Saturday/Sunday night I started vomiting into my CPAP mask/machine while still asleep. I wouldn?t have woken up unless my wife was there to hear me choking. She cleaned out my mask and had me lay on my side all night while monitoring me.  Scary stuff. Just thought you should make your friends with apnea aware. I still don?t remember the incident at all. I have a mild fever right now, 99.8. I used to tell my wife she saved my life, but now I don&#39;t mean it figuratively. UPDATE: I forgot to mention that I passed out Saturday night.  I was standing in the kitchen and the next thing I knew I was on the ground.

                                                10:00PM Saturday, 4/17/21 Sudden chest pain. Tried to sleep it off, pain lingered all day Sunday 4/18/21. 8:00PM went to local ER with same chest pain, had not gotten better. ER took blood draw, my troponin was 4.6 and doctors thought it was an error since I am 38 years old and otherwise health with no history of chest pain or family history of heat trouble. Second blood draw showed troponin at 5.0 getting worse. They called an ambulance and took me to the hospital nearby. Third blood draw showed 6.0 and I spiked at 10.0 overnight. I had several EKGs, a CT scan, and an angiogram. None of these showed any obstructions or blockages in the heart or blood vessels that could have caused the heart trauma. I had an echocardiogram which showed that my heart is only pumping at 50% which is low for a healthy young person who is a runner. I was diagnosed with myocarditis and with having had a Non-ST Segment Elevation Heart Attack. Again, I have no family history of this, I am otherwise healthy, I do not use drugs and I did not have any trauma to my chest, such as a car accident, that could have caused this. The only explanation is that it was related to the COVID shot, which I had roughly 48 hours before my sudden chest pain

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.

A 38-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/Lot number was not reported), intramuscular on Apr2021, at 38 years old, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 intramuscular on Mar2021 at 38 years old as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. On 15Apr2021, the patient experienced pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction and patient was hospitalized for 1 day. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care and Hospitalization. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination and medications within two weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 15Apr2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction which included anticoagulation. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

A 38-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at same age, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 15Apr2021 12:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0162) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included loratadine/ pseudoephedrine (CLARIDIN-D). The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at same age, administered in arm left on 25Mar2021 04:30 PM (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730) for covid-19 immunisation. The patient experienced chest pains, and short of breath both on 17Apr2021 22:00. Tried to sleep it off. 24 hours, didn&#39;t get better. On 17Apr2021, went to local ER, troponin at 4.6 ng/L. Doctors didn&#39;t believe it, did another blood draw. Went up to 5.0 ng/L. Ambulance to nearby hospital, troponin peaked at 9.9 ng/L. Echo showed decreased blood flow (50%) and EKG was irregular. Angiogram and CT scan show no blood clots or blockages. Patient was a healthy 38 male who was a distance runner. No history of chest pain or heart issues. Doctors determined incident almost certainly related to vaccine. The serious criteria for all events were hospitalization and duration were 2 days. The adverse events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. Colchicine received as treatment for the adverse events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID 19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID 19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (COVID antibody blood test): negative on 20Apr2021, Covid test (Nasal Swab): negative on 18Apr2021. The outcomes of events were recovering.

I was unconscious for 30 seconds, and while unconscious my eyes started to role to the back of my head. When I became alert I was on the floor and I couldn?t breathe! While on the floor gasping for air I vomited twice! 911 was called and an EKG was done on site! It showed that my heart rate was low, and I was transported to hospital ER department. Multiple test were done on me and everything came back perfect! No high blood pressure, not a diabetic, and no Permanent head damage.

                                                About 5 minutes after the injection I get a tingling feeling all over my body.  That quickly subsides. Then my heart rate jumps from 75 to 140. My face goes flush and I feel like I am going to pass out. This happened on the first shot so I purchased a blood oximeter for my second and watched it closely. My blood oxygen never went below 96 and mostly remained at 98.  Once my pulse hit 140 it immediately began to fall back to 75. About the time the nurse I alerted got there is was back to normal. I do not feel sick at all after either shot. Sure wish I knew what this reaction I am having was.

A 38-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 01May2021 as second dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2, on an unknown date, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced myocarditis on 05May2021, and in May2021 (reported as started 2 and a half days after receiving the second dose) experienced pleuritic chest pain, difficulty breathing, myalgia, headache, and flu-like symptoms. The patient was hospitalized for the events from 05May2021 to an unknown date. The reporter assessed the events as life-threatening. The adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room. The reporter assessed that the patient&#39;s events were caused by the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, a possible association of the suspect drug administration with the reported events cannot be excluded, due to a plausible temporal relationship. This case will be reassessed when additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He lost strength in his left part of the body and had a speech slur and double vision. He had to wear an eye patch and had a headache. Hospital said no surgery was needed and transfered him to Rehab for rehab. He is currently there getting treatment.

                                                I nearly fainted. Had about 3 different moments of heart flutters (not sure how else to describe it) My vision was half blackened. I was light headed and had a little bit of breathing weirdness. It probably only lasted about 2 minutes. I laid down and all symptoms went away in about a minute.   The only other time I fainted in my life it was from seeing blood shoot out of my body but it wasn&#39;t accompanied by heart flutters.

                                                On day 2 or 3 of getting the shot, I started feeling a burning sensation in my chest and what felt like my heart. It was about 3 or 4 out of 10 on the pain scale. I also had intermittent tingling sensations, mostly on my cheek to the left of my nose, but also tingling in locations around my body which happened only a couple of times.  My heart beat rapidly. It was similar to the heart palpitations I get when I eat certain foods. It also felt as if my heart was constrained, as if its outer layers were less flexible than usual.  When the symptoms showed up I started following a fairly aggressive anti-inflammatory diet, mainly wheat/cereal and Advil. I spent most of the time  lying in bed facing up, in order to minimize strain on my heart. I had trouble laying on my side, since my chest/heart was sensitive to pressure. I also believe I was more acutely aware of the distribution of blood throughout my body, and laying on my side felt similar to being upside down in that blood was pooling heavily at the bottom, but I may be misremembering the sensation.  I don&#39;t know if I had shortness of breath, since I took care to avoid exertion. Since my heart was beating like crazy, exertion of any kind seemed like a really bad idea.  The symptoms did not change in severity for a couple days. On day 4 or 5 of getting the shot, I felt slightly feverish for about a 10 minute period. During this time, I noticed the burning sensation weakening slightly, and I began feeling a soreness on my chest near my left shoulder, which I believe is a lymph node area.  Each day after, the symptoms and my heart calmed down little by little.  ----  On day 9, I went to the emergency room since I still had heart palpitations and the burning sensation at about a 1/10 pain level. Just sitting upright caused my heart to go into overdrive. The hospital did not find anything out of the ordinary. I was given MAALOX, but the burning sensation was too faint to know if there was any improvement as a result.  Their best theory is that I had costochondritis.  ----  On day 11, after eating dinner I started getting &#34;chronic hiccups&#34;. These last anywhere from 10 minutes to a couple of hours without stopping. I am not sure whether food or drinks cause them. They are short/acute hiccups and happen at an interval of about 10-15 seconds. I have no history of such a thing.  ----  Today is day 12. The symptoms are noticeably better since I visited the hospital, but the burning sensation is still present around what feels like my heart and the hiccups aren&#39;t stopping.  My best theory is that I may have had an infection by the time I got the vaccine. Maybe I had an infection, not necessarily COVID but some related virus, that was kept in check below an immune response threshold until the vaccine came along and led to the immune system burning the whole infection down.

Pt did well with immediate CPR and cardioversion on the scene but he had no hx of major heart disease.  Minor LV dysfunction ( LV 45%).  It turned out on that the next day 6/1 pt developed fever and then COVID was checked and  was positive.  He then developed true covid and was treated.  Echo revealed a new dilated CM with reduced EF.   I feel his arrest was more likely related to the active covid or his DCM but wanted to report in case given the temporal association

A 39-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 08:30 AM (at the age of 39 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a hospital. The patient had no medical history and had no known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included testosterone. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 12Jan2021 at 12:30 AM (at the age of 39 years old) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient developed severe flu symptoms on 02Feb2021 at 20:30. The patient experienced chest pain and myocarditis on 12Feb2021 at 03:00 AM. It was reported that after 12 hours, the patient developed severe flu symptoms for the following 48 hours. Then she developed severe chest pain and was hospitalized for myocarditis. The patient was hospitalized in Feb2021 for 5 days. The patient received treatment for the events which included heart medications and heart angiogram. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination which included blood test and nasal swab, both with negative results on 12Feb2021. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event myocarditis was most likely due to influenza, which was an intercurrent infection, and unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162B2. There is no plausible mechanism implicating BNT162B2 to the reported event based on the drug known safety profile. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours.  Low fever, chills, heavy heart beat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours.  Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours.  At ~4 days since the first shot, the facial numbness, heavy heart beat, and fatigue persisted, though the drooping became less prominent and the other symptoms have largely resolved.  At ~2 weeks since the first shot, the facial numbness has been constant, but varying in intensity, and the left-side facial drooping has returned multiple times.

                                                Patient presented on 3/30/21 for his first COVID vaccine appointment. Patient checked in at the pharmacy and came back to the clinic location. During the screening process, the patient did state he has an issue with needles in the past. Patient was with his wife who confirmed that it has never been due to the medication but just a fear of needles. Patient gets lightheaded. After giving the vaccine, the patient was fine at first but then did state he wasnt feeling well. The wife, came and held his hands and I was holding his back and head. Patient did tense up and shook once (not a seizure) and did lose consciousness for about 10 seconds. Had a tech call a code white and store management did come. Patient came back to and seemed fine. He had a Gatorade and drank that and also a bottle of water. Patient started to feel a little better but had a second minor episode (did not seem to lose consciousness). We also got a cold pack and placed on patient&#39;s head/neck. He ultimately took about 45 mins to an hour post dose and was able to leave under his own power. Patient and wife appreciative of efforts.

A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 12:15 (lot number: EN6208) as single dose at the age of 39 years old for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies: minor reaction to iodine CT contrast. Concomitant medications included fish oil, turmeric [curcuma longa rhizome] (TURMERIC), and xantofyl (LUTEIN); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced allergies (minor reaction to iodine CT contrast). On 11Mar2021 12:45 PM, within an hour of the shot, the patient started feeling dizzy. Intense fatigue and full body aches set in within 3 hours. Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours. Low fever, chills, heavy heartbeat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours. Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours. Facial numbness, heavy heartbeat, and fatigue persist, though drooping has become less pronounced and the other symptoms have largely resolved at 100 hours since the first shot. Seeking guidance on whether further medical help should be sought (did nurse line call with insurance company) and whether the booster shot should be administered. The AEs resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was given for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. No other vaccines received four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae.

                                                Patient lost consciousness about 10-15 seconds after vaccination administered.  Concerned initially that patient may have been having a seizure due to twitching motion of head lasting 2-3 seconds. Then patient appeared to be sleeping.  He was breathing, but audibly snoring and it seemed somewhat irregular.  I moved patient from chair to floor and had staff call 911.  Patient was still breathing but remained unconscious for about 1.5-2 minutes.  He then woke abruptly and was immediately lucid.  He was awake when EMS arrived.  He stated he has passed out on previous occasions of abrupt pain/use of needles.  EMS monitored patient for around 20-30 minutes, and he also had a bottle of orange juice and a granola bar and appeared to feel better.  Patient declined transport to hospital by emergency personnel.

                                                In the Morning after my shot, I was getting breakfast ready for my kids. Everything seemed fine at the time and I started getting an odd feeling. Not really a dizzy or lightheaded feeling, but an odd feeling. The next thing I know, I came to on the floor. My security camera in the living room caught part of it from down a hall. I fell strait forward, onto my stomach with a large crash. The rest of the day, I did feel fatigue, joint pain in my knees and then chills/hot flashes later in the day/evening. The next morning (Friday) I woke up with a scratchy throat but felt fine the rest of the day.  I  have never fainted in the past. I don&#39;t know what would bring that on.  I also have not had that feeling or any fainting spells since that incident. My wife came home about 8am out of concern.

A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 25Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s prior vaccinations included tetanus shot on 09Feb2021. On 28Mar2021, 2 days after taking the first dose, the patient experienced reactions from the vaccine which included Itchiness on the abdomen area, knees, and toes and disorientation and went to emergency room for treatment. The patient wanted to know whether these are normal side effects of the vaccine. Upon follow-up on 28Mar2021, the patient reported that he felt weird after receiving the vaccine and lightheadedness. He told the nurse that he didn&#39;t eat before getting the vaccine. And wasn&#39;t sure if getting the vaccine was like having blood drawn so he hadn&#39;t eaten anything. The nurse told him he might be feeling lightheaded because he didn&#39;t eat and she gave him some lollipops and the patient felt much better. The patient also stated that on 28Mar2021, he was feeling overwhelmed and cannot describe the feeling. It was like itchy or pins and needles all over his body. The patient felt like he was going to pass out, as he as disoriented. The patient stated that he went to the Emergency Department. They kept him overnight, checked his heart, did some blood work, checked his blood sugar, gave him a Covid 19 test. The patient stated that everything came back normal. The Emergency Department concluded that the events could be due to the Covid 19 vaccine and described that his system was fighting the Covid 19 vaccine or something. The patient was asking if this is normal. He was also asking for a copy of this safety report for work purposes. The patient went to the Emergency Department on 28Mar2021 (around 7pm) and was in observation overnight. He was discharged from the Emergency Department this morning, 29Mar2021 at around 11:00AM. The patient confirmed that he was not hospitalized. The patient stated that he may be overthinking about the events and really paying attention to his body. He thinks he needs to rest as he was in the Emergency Department for a long time. The patient lab test included Blood sugar test. The outcome of the events was resolved for dizziness, unknown for feeling abnormal and overwhelmed and not resolved for other events.  Information on lot/batch number obtained. Additional information has been requested.

After a few minutes, I recovered and my blood pressure resumed to normal (114). As this was happening, my partner-- who was with me when I experienced the allergic reaction--observed that my face suddenly became red and flushed (a minute after getting vaccination).  Medical staff did not  need to administer an Epipen. They had me lie down and breathe. After about 15-20 minutes I felt normal. Medical staff had me wait a total of 30 minutes before releasing me.

                                                I went to the emergency room at Hospital on April 14, 2021,  after experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. After an abnormal EKG, blood tests showed a high troponin level. An ultrasound determined my heart ejection fraction had declined to 35-40 percent. An angiogram was performed that showed no blockages or tears in my heart. I was diagnosed with Myocarditis and admitted to the hospital. Over the next 36 hours my troponin level rose to more than 11 before starting to decline. I have prescribed a number of medications for treatment. On April 22 I had a cardiac MRI which confirmed the Myocarditis diagnosis. My heart function has improved to 55 percent and an EKG showed normal rhythm.  I have more tests and follow ups scheduled in the coming weeks.

I am a nephrologist practicing in my area.  10 days or so  after receiving Pfizer vaccine I started noticing left leg swelling and some redness. I didn&#39;t pay attention to it because I thought this could be a muscle or tendon issues because of my exercise. But the swelling did not go away, however, it decreased overtime with leg elevation, etc but when I checked my leg I found out that I have a DVT.   I am a healthy 39 ( when I received the vaccine but I am 40  now). I don&#39;t smoke. No family history.  I am on a blood thinner now.   I need to report this as I think that it is important to be reported.   I read in the news that a 40 year-old man was diagnosed with DVT after Pfizer vaccine  Please call or email if you need further info

Felt just like  Pericarditis that I had back in February.  This was confirmed with EKG.  Chest X-Ray unremarkable.    Pericarditis earlier diagnosed on February 16th, assumed by medical professional that likely had COVID at that time based on recurrence after vaccine.  No previous occurrence of Pericarditis prior to Feb 2021

A 39-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 39 years old, on 11Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included wolff-parkinson-white syndrome from an unknown date to 15Mar2021. The patient was diagnosed with this later in life, but was told he probably had it his entire life it just hadn&#39;t caused any issues for him. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously got the flu vaccine for immunization every year with no issues. The patient passed away from a pulmonary embolism on 15Mar2021. The patient was not hospitalized prior to his death.  He died from the pulmonary embolism in his sleep. The reporter denied any medications, labs, testing, or treatments for her husband relevant to these events. The patient died on 15Mar2021. There was a private autopsy performed and they said that the Pfizer Covid Vaccine was one of the contributing factors to the patient&#39;s death. The autopsy said the vaccine was a contributing factor. The reporter stated she told them since they said it was the pulmonary embolism that killed him, then that&#39;s what it should say. The Medical Examiner was saying that the science for the vaccine is so new, they just don&#39;t have the data that they need.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Pulmonary embolism

                                                Sinus Tachycardia started within 24 hours after vaccine.  Did have the expected headache, chills and body aches.  As these started to ease up, the Tachycardia started.  Called the Urgent Care Nurse and was advised to go to the hospital.  Went, they ran a preliminary EKG and immediately admitted me to the facility.  Three days later am still tired with headache.
