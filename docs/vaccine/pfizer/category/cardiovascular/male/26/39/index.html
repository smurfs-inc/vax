A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly in unknown arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for routine mass immunizations (covid-19 immunization). The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Not a military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none and concomitant medications was none (he was on no other medications). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced tachycardia, intermittent palpitations, low grade fever/fever all started somewhere in the morning of 18Dec2020 and muscle aches on 17Dec2020. Physician assessed tachycardia and intermittent palpitations as serious due to medically significant. Physician stated that one of his workers had the vaccine and proceeded to have tachycardia and low grade fever. He would like to know if patient should get the second dose. The patient had mostly tachycardia with some intermittent palpitations. Patient was seen in his office on 18Dec2020, and got the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020. He also reported fever and muscle aches, although the fever was subjective and was not documented. Tachycardia improved and sent him to cardiology on 21Dec2020. It was not life threatening and they did an Electrocardiogram (EKG). His initial heart rate was 130. When he was seen again in their office on 21Dec2020, it was 93, which was baseline. It improved. He never got his temperature. The highest in office was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He had some muscle aches. The physician just sent patient to cardiology because he was having intermittent tachycardia and intermittent palpitations. Two visits to physician office. He was seen on 18Dec2020 and again on 21Dec2020. Relevant tests: they did testing for tachycardia but not related specifically. They did thyroid and EKG in office and he did not know if test were back. EKG was ok. The Thyroid, Complete blood count (CBC) and lipid (all were on an unknown date in Dec2020) were not back and were just done to make sure there were no cardiac issues. The outcome of the events was recovering. The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events tachycardia and palpitations cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

                                                I would like to start out by saying that I am well aware that this vaccine is known to cause side effects and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any side effects induced by it. The reason I am writing this is to provide information that you all can keep in mind as you provide guidance on your recommendations for the timing of when the vaccine should be administered to those who have already tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID-19 11 days prior to getting vaccinated. My symptoms from the virus began on 12/21/20, lasted until 12/26/20 and included: mild headache, fever of 100.3, moderate muscle fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and sinus congestion. I received the Pfizer vaccine on 1/3/21 at 11am and by 2am on 1/4/21 I was experiencing a temperature of 102.5, severe headache, severe muscle fatigue, and painful right axillary lymphadenopathy. Although they had almost completely resolved by 11am on 1/4/20, I would describe these side effects to the vaccine as significantly worse than the symptoms of the virus itself. As someone who has a stronger medical background than the general public (I am a 4th year dental student in a patient-facing role and was encouraged by my school to receive the vaccine despite already testing positive), I understood the likelihood of developing side effects to the vaccine and I am still planning on receiving my second dose in three weeks despite already showing clear signs of a strong immune response to the proteins created by the vaccine. The reason why I am writing this is because there was no guidance on recommending that I wait longer than 10 days between testing positive and receiving the vaccine and I am worried that if the general public is allowed to receive the vaccine at this same time interval, there will be a significant number of people who will have similar side effects (worse than those induced by the virus itself) and they will not only refuse a second dose, but could also vocally discourage many people from trusting the vaccine?s safety and benefit. I obviously don?t know what minimum timeframe should be recommended, but from my individual experience, 11 days was not sufficient. I will be happy to follow up if you would like to know how the symptoms fare after my second dose.

Took 50mg of benadryl shortly after and symptoms improved over the following hour.

I checked my HR on my smart watch and it said that around 12pm my HR was 157bpm which was right after getting the vaccine when I started walking home. My  resting HR is usually 47-52bpm. I am a very active person. I have been waking up in the middle of the night multiple times in night sweats and it feels like my heart is contracting very hard. I notice that my HR jumps up right when I start to be more active, but more than normal. On the 11th my average walking HR was 140. Today at work my HR was 134 at the highest around 9am and the lowest was 56bpm around 7am when I was getting ready for work. Additionally to the increased HR I have SOB when I walk and talk. I did have a sore arm as well the first day, but nothing more than any other injection I have had before.

On the morning of 1/8 I woke up with noted chills and headache.  I checked my temp and noticed 100.4* oral temp.  I also had back pain, muscle pain, headaches, continued fever (improved with motrin) and chills. My left arm from my shoulder to my wrist was with noted pain/aches, improved with motrin. On the morning of 1/9 I felt much better, did not take any motrin/tylenol and without any fever/chills.  Noted improvement of muscle aches in general and arm felt  the same as 1/7 (much better!).  Noted lymph swelling of my axillary lymph nodes with aching pain.  This has not gone away at current but improved with x1 dose of motrin.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 29-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 17Dec2020 at 11:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the hospital. On 27Dec2020, the patient experienced cervical and clavicular lymphadenopathy on the left side (same side as the vaccine shot was received). The patient first noticed some tenderness in neck about 10 days after vaccine was administered. The events were considered non-serious. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient had not recovered from the events.   Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I felt palpitations around 10-12 minutes after the 1st Pfizer dose was given, and asked the Doctor to take my vital signs. I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

A 30-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0140, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 13:00 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant drug. The patient experienced recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid on 04Jan2021 00:30, mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage on 31Dec2020, loss of smell on 02Jan2021, exhaustion/feeling tired on 03Jan2021, felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe, he still has his sense of taste, but it is dulled on an unspecified date. He was a pharmacist. He received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on Thursday 31Dec2020 1pm. Shortly thereafter, he got the typical side effects of the vaccine that are posted. Then 2.5 days letter he no longer had a sense of smell. Everything he read said that he probably came in contact with COVID prior to administration. His questions was since he test positive for COVID, should he still get the second shot. He got it at a clinic. He did experience mild congestion which started by 6 o&#39;clock. He started to notice slight congestion that kind of went away. Then, on Friday, about 24 hours later, he really noticed he had congestion. He took pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). Then his sense of smell diminished with the congestion and felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe. On Saturday, he decided to not take medication. That was when he noticed he could not smell anything. He had full blown congestion. It probably took two days when he started to lose his sense of smell. He received the shot on Thursday. On Saturday, he lost his sense of smell. He still has his sense of taste, but it was dulled. Sunday, he was just exhausted and feeling tired. These were all listed as typical side effects except for the loss of smell. Saturday was the worst. The congestion went into full nasal drainage. On Sunday he had no sinus issues. He still hasn&#39;t gained his sense of smell back. The exhaustion set in Sunday 03Jan2020. He doesn&#39;t feel like any of the side effects are serious. The exhaustion has started to let up some so it is improving. He was pretty much back to normal. He just couldn&#39;t figure out why he had a loss of smell. He had a COVID rapid test on 04Jan2021 at 8:30 am (as reported). He received an alert and hour later that it was positive. He was wondering whether the loss of smell could be from the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 rapid POC test: positive on 04Jan2021. The outcome of events for mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage was resolved on 03Jan2021, for loss of smell was not resolved, for exhaustion/feeling tired was resolving, for other events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported event &#34;recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid&#34; is considered possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 based on temporal association and known drug safety profile.

                                                In the evening after getting the shot, I started getting chills and became more sensitive to cold temperatures.  Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

                                                Started feeling very fatigued around 6/7 PM on 1/7/21. Ate dinner shortly after and took my normal sleeping pills as previously listed. Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

I was forwarned that the first dose primes the immune system, 2nd can be worse, so I was taking 600 mg Motrin q6 hours. Despite that, my arm progressively hurt worse and worse until now I can?t lift it above my waist. Full body aches and pains. Horrible chills and so cold. 102.1 F is highest temp so far, but that?s on top of scheduled Motrin.   Still glad that I got it, but man does it suck right now.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

Medical history included high cholesterol from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received influenza vaccine (FLU) on 10Dec2020 for immunization; and received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) on 24Dec2020 15:30 for Covid-19 immunization.

This other healthcare professional reported for a 32-year-old male patient (her fiance). A 32-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2  on 08Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient developed shingles on his face on 31Jan2021 and swollen lymph nodes on 01Feb2021. The events were reported as serious (medically significant) and worsened. There were no investigation assessment. The patient had not recovered from the events at the time of the report.    Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the Company considers the event swollen lymph nodes is possibly related to suspect vaccine BNT162B2. Other than a temporal association, there is no evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the event shingles, which is likely an intercurrent condition.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. On 28Jan2021 at 07:00, the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes. The patient stated that the lymph nodes were swollen on both sides (or so he thought, as he couldn&#39;t see the uvula at all). The patient stated, &#34;it looks about the same right now&#34;, but the pain (onset: Jan2021) has decreased. The patient stated he had taken several COVID-19 tests prior to the vaccination, on unspecified dates, all negative. The last test, a nasal swab was on Jan2021 with negative results. The clinical outcome of &#34;swollen lymph nodes/lymph nodes are swollen on both sides&#34; and pain was resolving.

He was not falling over but had to be very careful with his steps.; burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back; he felt off. It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux. He experienced some unusual side effects that were not listed on the web. His boss advised him to call. Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.   Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

A 34-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, Lot number EL0140, in Hospital, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 22Dec2020 (at 34 years of age) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prediabetes (glucose tolerance impaired) from an unknown date. The patient didn&#39;t have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included metformin and multivitamins. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced premature ventricular contractions, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, shortness of breath and chest pain. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care access and hospitalization as life threatening events. The patient was treated with diltiazem, fludrocortisone, aspirin and atorvastatin. He remained in hospital 2 days and then he was discharged. The patient underwent COVID-19 test (nasal swab) on 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 and both gave negative results. The patient had not recovered yet from the reported events at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events ventricular extrasystoles, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, dyspnea and chest pain cannot be excluded as the information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. The patient is a young adult with known prediabetes, but no other comorbidities reported. Information on tests done during admission, clinical course and working diagnosis would be helpful in further assessment of this case. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

This physician reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of 2 reports.   A 35-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. Caller stated that his close friend who was ER physician (front line worker) and within 24 hours after receiving the COVID vaccine, developed COVID or symptoms of COVID. Patient received the COVID vaccine on 18Dec2020 and the same night patient started with a low grade fever, body aches, chills, muscle pain, shortness of breath, cough, O2 saturation of 80% (hypoxia) and was in the intensive care unit now. Patient swore this was related to the vaccine. This patient tested positive for COVID. He had a CT (computerised tomogram) scan which showed extensive infiltration in the lungs in Dec2020. Patient was admitted to the hospital on 24Dec2020 and then was moved to the ICU 2 days later, on 26Dec2020. Caller thought patient had a positive COVID test at another hospital. Caller did know that tested positive at the current hospital on 26Dec2020 which was done to confirm the previous positive test. Caller thought patient had his first positive COVID test either the same day or the next day after receiving the vaccine. Event of O2 Saturation of 80% / hypoxia was reported as hospitalization from 24Dec2020 and life threatening; infiltration in the lungs and shortness of breath caused hospitalization from 24Dec2020, muscle pain, chills and positive COVID test was reported as medically significant; and other events were reported as non-serious.  Outcome of O2 saturation of 80% / hypoxia and shortness of breath was not recovered, outcome of cough was recovering; and outcome of other events were unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested. ; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a lack of efficacy with suspected vaccine BNT162B2 in this patient cannot be completely excluded.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2020519020 same reporter/drug , different patient/AE.

                                                Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis; Slurring his speech; Stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 35-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in deltoid (unknown if right or left) on 17Dec2020 at 30 ug, single for &#39;Preventative&#39;. Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications.(Physician) He is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. States what is going on with the patient may be associated as a side effect. The patient got the vaccine two to three weeks ago, he clarifies the patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and the patient ended up acutely developing (states it is a presumptive diagnosis) Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, states it looks like a radiologic diagnosis. The patient is an employee at hospital. When querying seriousness states it is medically significant but could be disabling but he thinks the patient will recover. Reporter seriousness for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis: Medically significant, Hospitalization. Patient was hospitalized on Sunday and he is still admitted at this time. Dates when patient was in hospital for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from 03Jan2021 to ongoing. Caller thinks the patient was flown to (Place) yesterday. The patient&#39;s mother asked the caller if the caller thought the acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from the vaccine and the caller responded that he did not think it was from the vaccine. He confirms the patient is still admitted in the hospital and the patient&#39;s attending neurologist is doctor. The caller heard about the patient from doctor. When querying covid vaccine dose, the caller states the standard dose is 30 mcg. This was clarified and documented as provided. The patient has not received his second dose yet. He asks if the patient should receive the second dose. He asks a general question if a pregnant patient can be given the Pfizer covid vaccine. He heard the patient had a stroke then the CFO tried to talk to him and the patient was slurring his speech. Caller spoke to the patient&#39;s mother this morning and caller told the mother that he would try to find out what is going on with the patient.  He asked that the patient get an HIV test even though he does not think the patient is at risk. Vaccination facility type was Hospital. Vaccine administered at military facility was No. None additional vaccines administered on same date of the PFIZER suspect. AE acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis require a visit to Emergency Room, not visit to physician office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. He has heard of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis being associated with vaccines in the past and states that it is rare and usually in kids. States he saw patients that may have had acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis back in the 80s and 90s. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (Patient will get steroids tonight pending the review of the x-ray). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke with speech slurred, and the presumptive diagnosis of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (looks like a radiologic diagnosis by the reporting physician), was most likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Chills and muscle fatigue starting around 10:30am 1/12. Grew more intense throughout the day and into the night.  Had a fever starting around 3pm 1/12. Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

A 35-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via intramuscular on the left arm, on 21Jan2021 at 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. No history of allergic reactions to any meds (medication) in the past or other vaccines in childhood. Otherwise young healthy male with no history of hypertension. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EJ1686) via intramuscular on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 16:00 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe elevation of blood pressure. On 22Jan2021, at 12:00 AM, after the 2nd dose in left arm, after about 24 to 48 hours, the patient experienced vesicular pruritic erythematous patches in multiple locations of my left arm, left arm pit, left upper back, left chest occurred, peaking on day three and still remain after one week. The blisters have opened leaving behind painful ulcers. This is not a rash that disappears in a few days. It will take much longer than that to heal. No rash with the first dose. Also, with both doses, had severe elevation of blood pressure as high as 180/100 within 2 to 5 hours on 22Jan2021, requiring about 3 doses of clonidine over 7 days where bp would cycle up and down. The seriousness of the events was reported as non-serious. Since the vaccination, the patient has been not tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events and included Benadryl, mometasone cream and clonidine. The outcome of the events was reported as recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

They asked me if I had pain and I said no. Just a high heart rate. WAs told to monitor it. Next day, I had chest pain and tightness in chest and fast heartrate. I went to ER. Gave me IV; fluids and steroids. They sent me home with steroids for five days. About three or four days after steroids were done, it resolved the symptoms.

Possibly some worsening exercise tolerance ~3-4 weeks after initial onset date. I&#39;m not sure if it was deconditioning vs lingering covid effects.   No side effects from first covid vaccine minus a sore arm. After second dose some mild fatigue ~2 days. Then 12 days after second dose significant more fatigue and in the next few days chills at night and tachycardia with pulse in 120s at rest. No fever, pain, sob, swelling or other symptoms. Presented to immediate care on 2/27 predominantly for the tachycardia. Was referred to the ED.  Discharged on 3/1 on metoprolol with possible diagnosis of viral myocarditis.

No facial or peripheral swelling.  Provided fluids (by mouth), cold compresses, and benadryl. Gradual improvement after this.  Majority of symptoms lasted for approx 1 to 1.5 hours; with some waxing/waning palpitations for another~1 hour.

I stopped and walked- it dropped to 168 so I slowed down and it spiked again.  With any exercise since vaccine my heart rate has been elevated.  I have had heart palpitations- two days after the vaccine and blood pressure was high for me.  Blood pressure is not back down but still slightly higher than usual- I have slowed my normal exercise routines down but I am experiencing tightness in chest.

I woke up today, 01/12/2021 and had pain and swelling in my right arm pit. I went to my employer&#39;s employee health services and was checked out by a provider. I was told that he didn&#39;t see anything, and he minimized my symptoms. He didn&#39;t seem like he wanted to evaluate me from the time he walked in the exam room. He told me &#34;what do you want us to do? It looks normal.&#34; He then went on to tell them he&#39;s not going to give me time off for work aside from today. I did not ask for any time off once during the evaluation. I recheck my arm pit when I got home, and noticed the swelling is approx. 3&#34;x 3&#34;s. It was not hard to see when I rechecked. I have noticeable pain the swollen area as well. The swelling is visible when I extend my right arm all the way up above my head. I attempted to tell the employee health provider this, but he preferred to check in a manner that does not show the swelling. I am slightly muscular and when my arm is down, you can only feel soft tissue. Employee health gave me Ibuprofen to treat my Sx&#39;s.  I called my primary physician&#39;s office and am waiting for a call back to be either scheduled for an evaluation or receive medical advice.

I am a physician who likely had contracted COVID in 04/2020 and has been suffering long COVID sx since. No significant reaction to dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine other than sore arm. 2nd dose within 12 hours had severe rigors, severe chills, then fever to 39.6 the first night (took 1 dose of tylenol and 1 of advil after), temp of 38-39 the next 12 hours, and then the 2nd night had a fever high of 41.4 degrees (took another tylenol). Had sweats the entire night after and defervesced after. Day 3-5 mostly involve myalgia, nausea, anorexia, malaise, chills, HA, and mild SOB. Took about 1 week to &#34;recover&#34; to my long COVID baseline after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Still having a bit worse SOB now compared to prior to 2nd dose but unsure if it has to do with the vaccine at this point. Had tested for positive anti-spike protein ab (likely from the 1st dose) the morning of my 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

                                                Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 at 15:15 hours.  A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

On 12/25,   seven days after  receiving the  shot  I started to get right lower leg pain and I kept complaining about it till New Years Day. I had no symptoms of a DVT.  I triaged on 1/1/21 and the doctors  ordered  labs/imaging  and the results were  as followed: D-Dimer  biomarker  (&#43;) , Ultrasound of the Rt lower leg ( - ) ,  CTA showed a PE (segmental right upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus). I  was discharged on  Xarelto and advised to follow  up with a hematologist. On 1/5/2021,  I went to hematology and they did a whole bunch of labs. I was sent to get a  ultrasound   of the leg because the pain persist and they found  a clot hidden by my soleus. The plan is to continue on the Xarelto for 6 months. Come back in 3 weeks to scan my leg again and get my lab results.  On 1/12/2021, I received the 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccination.

Everything was negative. They assumed his body couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. He was supposed to have received the second shot yesterday (20Jan2021). Employee Health said his Primary Care Physician would have to make the decision on him taking it or not. His doctor said he would have to do more research with Pfizer before he says if he can take it or not. Emergency Room visit required due to event passing out.

The worst occurred the day after when my body could no longer absorb insulin. I increased my basal rate by almost 400% and could not bring my sugars down. Saturday afternoon I began experiencing symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis: stomach pain, vomiting, high ketones and very high  blood sugars. I was able to eventually take in enough water to lower my ketones and sugar and narrowly avoided going to the ER, but high blood sugars and headache have persisted and I am still experiencing these symptoms.

                                                myocarditis; severe chest pain; developed severe flu symptoms; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 39-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 08:30 AM (at the age of 39 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a hospital. The patient had no medical history and had no known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included testosterone. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 12Jan2021 at 12:30 AM (at the age of 39 years old) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient developed severe flu symptoms on 02Feb2021 at 20:30. The patient experienced chest pain and myocarditis on 12Feb2021 at 03:00 AM. It was reported that after 12 hours, the patient developed severe flu symptoms for the following 48 hours. Then she developed severe chest pain and was hospitalized for myocarditis. The patient was hospitalized in Feb2021 for 5 days. The patient received treatment for the events which included heart medications and heart angiogram. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination which included blood test and nasal swab, both with negative results on 12Feb2021. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event myocarditis was most likely due to influenza, which was an intercurrent infection, and unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162B2. There is no plausible mechanism implicating BNT162B2 to the reported event based on the drug known safety profile. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.
