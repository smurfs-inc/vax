                                                Tachycardia; Intermittent palpitations; Low grade fever/fever; muscle aches; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly in unknown arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for routine mass immunizations (covid-19 immunization). The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Not a military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none and concomitant medications was none (he was on no other medications). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced tachycardia, intermittent palpitations, low grade fever/fever all started somewhere in the morning of 18Dec2020 and muscle aches on 17Dec2020. Physician assessed tachycardia and intermittent palpitations as serious due to medically significant. Physician stated that one of his workers had the vaccine and proceeded to have tachycardia and low grade fever. He would like to know if patient should get the second dose. The patient had mostly tachycardia with some intermittent palpitations. Patient was seen in his office on 18Dec2020, and got the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020. He also reported fever and muscle aches, although the fever was subjective and was not documented. Tachycardia improved and sent him to cardiology on 21Dec2020. It was not life threatening and they did an Electrocardiogram (EKG). His initial heart rate was 130. When he was seen again in their office on 21Dec2020, it was 93, which was baseline. It improved. He never got his temperature. The highest in office was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He had some muscle aches. The physician just sent patient to cardiology because he was having intermittent tachycardia and intermittent palpitations. Two visits to physician office. He was seen on 18Dec2020 and again on 21Dec2020. Relevant tests: they did testing for tachycardia but not related specifically. They did thyroid and EKG in office and he did not know if test were back. EKG was ok. The Thyroid, Complete blood count (CBC) and lipid (all were on an unknown date in Dec2020) were not back and were just done to make sure there were no cardiac issues. The outcome of the events was recovering. The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events tachycardia and palpitations cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I checked my HR on my smart watch and it said that around 12pm my HR was 157bpm which was right after getting the vaccine when I started walking home. My  resting HR is usually 47-52bpm. I am a very active person. I have been waking up in the middle of the night multiple times in night sweats and it feels like my heart is contracting very hard. I notice that my HR jumps up right when I start to be more active, but more than normal. On the 11th my average walking HR was 140. Today at work my HR was 134 at the highest around 9am and the lowest was 56bpm around 7am when I was getting ready for work. Additionally to the increased HR I have SOB when I walk and talk. I did have a sore arm as well the first day, but nothing more than any other injection I have had before.

                                                When patient was in for his 2nd dose, reported that an hour after the first vaccination was given he felt like his heart rate was high. No measurement was ever taken to confirm it was in fact high. He also became flushed. He was wearing a sweatshirt, so when he took that off he was feeling better. This episode lasted for 5 hours. No comorbidities or other heart conditions. We asked if he was possibly dehydrated or had any caffeine that day. I determined to proceed with dose 2 under the request that he came back after 1 hour and 2 hours respectively to get vitals.

Labs drawn 4/5 which revealed pancytopenia, rechecked today and numbers are worsening. Working to get him into hematology now. 28 yo male s/p Covid-19 Vaccine (Pfizer) on 3/30 with lightheadedness only when bending down and coming up returns for follow up today for pancytopenia found on labs obtained 4/5. He denies any recent viral symptoms. He did not have any episodes in past that made him question that he may have had Covid-19 viral illness. He is able to tolerate his normal daily exercise and bike without any symptoms. He has no dietary restrictions, eats dairy, meat, lots of vegetables/fruits, pastas and some breads/cereals. He drinks alcohol once per week. He abstains from ETOH every April. He has used edible THC in past, only once per month at most. He has not been tested for HIV in past. His girlfriend, in last semester of school advised him to ask about HIV testing. He denies any chest pain, SOB, HA.   Upon review of his lab results yesterday, I called the hematology fellow, Dr. through program at hospital and he recommended the labs to be obtained and rechecking labs in one week. He felt the student was not exhibiting any emergent symptoms requiring emergent evaluation. Patient and I spoke on phone after this call with fell at 1557 4/6 and I advised him to seek emergent medical eval in ED for any CP, SOB, HA or any neurologic symptoms. Patient has not had any of those symptoms. He exercised this morning without difficulty.   He notes raised papules on legs which he has had in past. They have currently been present for a few days. He believes it to be related to biking in sweatpants. He has been in a hot tub recently, but after the bumps were present. They do not itch. He has had them in past, more in winter months with heavier clothing.    He also notices slight left arm pain today. This was site of his vaccine. He denies any swollen lymph nodes. He is notices only with arm movement.   He denies any FH of blood disorder/ blood cancers/MDS. He denies bruising, bleeding or dark stools.   He states he likely has not had a blood draw in past, unless one visit to ER, for HA/concussion in high school (9&#43;yrs ago) resulted in any blood test.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did.

                                                I felt palpitations around 10-12 minutes after the 1st Pfizer dose was given, and asked the Doctor to take my vital signs. I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

A 31-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for front line worker (covid-19 immunization). Medical history included ongoing HIV since 2015. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for front line worker (covid-19 immunization). The patient reported that he received his second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine last Monday (11Jan2021) between 8:00 am and 8:30 am, and since then he has been sick and has been experiencing some side effects. He mentioned that he has been in contact with someone who is Covid-19 positive on an unspecified date. He works at the front desk registration in a hospital. He has been tired and fatigued, has had a low-grade fever, vomiting, headache, cough and chest tightness. He added that on Monday evening (11Jan2021), he became tired and fatigued. He had an on and off fever on Tuesday (12Jan2021). He started vomiting while coughing on 12Jan2021. He went to the doctor last night (13Jan2021) and he said he got tested for Covid-19 on 13Jan2021, but the results came out negative. The physician said that it would. However, his physician said that it was too early to tell if he has been infected since he has just been exposed last Monday. Normally, they like to have a 5 day turn around for a true reading. He said his physician told him he just needed to quarantine. He mentioned that his chest feels tight when he coughs on 13Jan2021. When he had to take deep breaths while the doctor was listening to him breath his chest was tight. He had blood work drawn at the doctor&#39;s office, but he does not have any results to provide. The patient wanted to know what he needs to do about this. He was inquiring if there any recommendations. He is probably negative because he is symptomatic. His employer said it may be a reaction from the shot. The outcome of the events sickness and exposure to COVID-19 were unknown, as for the event vomiting was recovered on 12Jan2021 while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.    The following information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

Upon making my way through the pharmacy to open the door the patient collapsed from a standing position to the floor. The patient regained conscience almost immediately after the fall and reported no injuries. EMS was also on scene by coincidence, shopping. The patient declined their assistance.

The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell.

                                                I was sitting down at work when out of the blue I experienced heart palpitations, lightheadedness, weakness and shortness of breath that lasted for about an hour. I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

Within 5-10 minutes he slumped in his chair and became unresponsive. Became responsive to voice but was slurring his words. Patient was diaphoretic. HR in 90s, O2 98%. His eyes rolled back in his head  suspecting vasovagal episode, we moved patient to the floor  and raised his legs. He became more responsive. Was fully oriented although did not seem incredibly alert. Cycled multiple BPs with 100s-110s/60s-70s. HR 70s-80s  supine, O2 sat 96-98%.  EMS was called for transport to ED given patient&#39;s lack of prompt recovery. We  attempted to sit patient up and he again became lightheaded and had to lie back down.

                                                I developed atrial fibrillation which is ongoing several months later; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician.   A 32-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 at single dose via an unspecified route of administration  on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included colitis ulcerative. Concomitant medications included mesalamine. On 31Jan2021 developed atrial fibrillation which is ongoing several months later. Treatment received included  metoprolol, sotalol. At the time of the reporting the patient had not yet recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

I checked my Apple Watch and my resting heart rate was 156bpm. The nurse at the clinic than confirmed my heart rate as well as an elevated Blood Pressure. After remaining at the clinic for observation, my resting heart rate only dropped to 124bpm. At that time the nurse felt I should go to the ER for an evaluation. She escorted me to the ER where I was evaluated and released 5.5 hours later with nothing found. ER attending physician advised to get the 2nd dose but confirm with PCP. My PCP also advised to get the 2nd dose.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night with sever chills. My body was shaking uncontrollably. I took an ibuprofen and then took a 40 minute hot shower. My chest felt tight and I couldn?t catch my breath, so I called 911 for extra precaution. My vitals were good so I was advised to take ibuprofen and stay hydrated. This chills, achy body, headache lasted the whole day. Chills, headache, body aches. It wasn?t until about 48 hours after the shot that I began to feel better.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

He was not falling over but had to be very careful with his steps.; burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back; he felt off. It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux. He experienced some unusual side effects that were not listed on the web. His boss advised him to call. Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.   Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

A 35-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in deltoid (unknown if right or left) on 17Dec2020 at 30 ug, single for &#39;Preventative&#39;. Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications.(Physician) He is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. States what is going on with the patient may be associated as a side effect. The patient got the vaccine two to three weeks ago, he clarifies the patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and the patient ended up acutely developing (states it is a presumptive diagnosis) Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, states it looks like a radiologic diagnosis. The patient is an employee at hospital. When querying seriousness states it is medically significant but could be disabling but he thinks the patient will recover. Reporter seriousness for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis: Medically significant, Hospitalization. Patient was hospitalized on Sunday and he is still admitted at this time. Dates when patient was in hospital for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from 03Jan2021 to ongoing. Caller thinks the patient was flown to (Place) yesterday. The patient&#39;s mother asked the caller if the caller thought the acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from the vaccine and the caller responded that he did not think it was from the vaccine. He confirms the patient is still admitted in the hospital and the patient&#39;s attending neurologist is doctor. The caller heard about the patient from doctor. When querying covid vaccine dose, the caller states the standard dose is 30 mcg. This was clarified and documented as provided. The patient has not received his second dose yet. He asks if the patient should receive the second dose. He asks a general question if a pregnant patient can be given the Pfizer covid vaccine. He heard the patient had a stroke then the CFO tried to talk to him and the patient was slurring his speech. Caller spoke to the patient&#39;s mother this morning and caller told the mother that he would try to find out what is going on with the patient.  He asked that the patient get an HIV test even though he does not think the patient is at risk. Vaccination facility type was Hospital. Vaccine administered at military facility was No. None additional vaccines administered on same date of the PFIZER suspect. AE acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis require a visit to Emergency Room, not visit to physician office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. He has heard of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis being associated with vaccines in the past and states that it is rare and usually in kids. States he saw patients that may have had acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis back in the 80s and 90s. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (Patient will get steroids tonight pending the review of the x-ray). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke with speech slurred, and the presumptive diagnosis of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (looks like a radiologic diagnosis by the reporting physician), was most likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Chills and muscle fatigue starting around 10:30am 1/12. Grew more intense throughout the day and into the night.  Had a fever starting around 3pm 1/12. Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

He went to the emergency room and was treated with Benadryl and steroids. The following morning he continued to have skin pruritus and developed a few skin lesions. He was also fatigued and had some shortness of breath with exertion. He had Allegra in the home so he was encouraged to take it and  also had been prescribed Benadryl which he could take as needed.

So, no unusual side effect for 24h, then experienced on Friday night: headaches, chills, body ache, fatigue. Took 650 mg of acetaminophen. Same symptoms on Saturday with increase in intensity, plus mild fever in the evening at 99.6 F (instead of 97.4 F which is &#34;my normal&#34;), nausea, painful eye balls, sensitivity to light and noise, loss of appetite. Took 650 mg tabs of  acetaminophen throughout the day per bottle instruction.  Extreme fatigue Saturday night and severe headaches, fever at 100.2 F that night, treated with acetaminophen. By Sunday night temperature was 100.9 F, extreme fatigue and severe headaches and painful eye balls, heart rate racing up to 120 BPM when moving from bathroom to living room. Went back down to 65 BPM after about 1min at rest. Tried massages of upper body to loosen muscle, seemed to help with bodyache. Spent Saturday through Tuesday at home. Rapid covid 19 test negative. Back to work on Wednesday.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

A 35-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration (Unknown if  given intramuscularly) on 15Jan2021 09:30 at a single dose on left arm below shoulder for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced fever of 102 for 4 days on 16Jan2021 14:00 and oxygen saturation low on 20Jan2021 12:00 (reported as &#34;12:00 - 12:30&#34;). He received first dose 15Jan2021. He has not had a cough, but had 102 degree Fahrenheit fever for 4 days, so he had to stay home from work. He  had to get a COVID test and it was negative today (unspecified date). While he was there, they checked his oxygen level and it was 78 and then after a few minutes it was 86 and 88. There was no prescriber. He received it at a healthcare facility. He is supposed to go back to get second dose on 05Feb2021. It is unknown if it was given intramuscularly. The outcome of the events was not recovered. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required.  He is to follow up with his general practitioner, but he has not gone yet. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and no adverse event following prior vaccinations. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. Vaccination facility type was Hospital. Family medical history includes, Father is Diabetic and mother has colon cancer.

                                                I had the normal symptoms of pain at injection site, headache, fatigue, chills, muscle aches.  I did get a fever for a short duration.  The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

The patient had no medical history. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. No history of allergic reactions to any meds (medication) in the past or other vaccines in childhood. Otherwise young healthy male with no history of hypertension. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EJ1686) via intramuscular on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 16:00 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe elevation of blood pressure. On 22Jan2021, at 12:00 AM, after the 2nd dose in left arm, after about 24 to 48 hours, the patient experienced vesicular pruritic erythematous patches in multiple locations of my left arm, left arm pit, left upper back, left chest occurred, peaking on day three and still remain after one week. The blisters have opened leaving behind painful ulcers. This is not a rash that disappears in a few days. It will take much longer than that to heal. No rash with the first dose. Also, with both doses, had severe elevation of blood pressure as high as 180/100 within 2 to 5 hours on 22Jan2021, requiring about 3 doses of clonidine over 7 days where bp would cycle up and down. The seriousness of the events was reported as non-serious. Since the vaccination, the patient has been not tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events and included Benadryl, mometasone cream and clonidine. The outcome of the events was reported as recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 8 pm that night, I felt my chest going really fast - my heart rate was high. I called the nurse hotline. They asked me if I had pain and I said no. Just a high heart rate. WAs told to monitor it. Next day, I had chest pain and tightness in chest and fast heartrate. I went to ER. Gave me IV; fluids and steroids. They sent me home with steroids for five days. About three or four days after steroids were done, it resolved the symptoms.

                                                I tested positive for covid on ~11/26. Relatively mild case with mild fatigue and lost of taste and smell. Possibly some worsening exercise tolerance ~3-4 weeks after initial onset date. I&#39;m not sure if it was deconditioning vs lingering covid effects.   No side effects from first covid vaccine minus a sore arm. After second dose some mild fatigue ~2 days. Then 12 days after second dose significant more fatigue and in the next few days chills at night and tachycardia with pulse in 120s at rest. No fever, pain, sob, swelling or other symptoms. Presented to immediate care on 2/27 predominantly for the tachycardia. Was referred to the ED.  Discharged on 3/1 on metoprolol with possible diagnosis of viral myocarditis.

This 35- year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration, on 12Apr2021 at 09:30 am (at the age of 35-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination, in left arm. The facility where COVID-19 vaccine was administered was a hospital. No known allergies. Patient has no relevant medical history. States: I live a healthy lifestyle diet, exercise, proper rest. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 12Apr2021 10:00 am, the patient stated: I passed out and or blacked out on my drive home from the hospital. I was careful to follow the 15minute wait period before I left the hospital and was ok at that point. I had tense nerve feelings came over me as it grew so strong, I was forced to try and get my car on an off ramp to leave the highway I was on. I thankfully did not get any real injuries to my body as I spun and landed on the side of the road in the grass area. However, this experience was horrifying to say the least. I had a delayed reaction to this vaccine, other than this one incident, I really only had the typical body aches or pain for 24 hours and a bit of nerve twitching. I will not mark this as a risk of death, because it was my driving a car that risked my safety not the vaccine, however, the vaccine did cause the black out. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination.  Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

Upon checking vitals was tachycardic with heart rate in 120s; drop in blood pressure to 100/50 (my baseline is 120/75).  No wheezing. No stridor. Oxygen saturations 99%. No hives or rash. No facial or peripheral swelling.  Provided fluids (by mouth), cold compresses, and benadryl. Gradual improvement after this.  Majority of symptoms lasted for approx 1 to 1.5 hours; with some waxing/waning palpitations for another~1 hour.  I have no prior history of similar symptoms after receiving vaccines or medications in the past.

I stopped and walked- it dropped to 168 so I slowed down and it spiked again.  With any exercise since vaccine my heart rate has been elevated.  I have had heart palpitations- two days after the vaccine and blood pressure was high for me.  Blood pressure is not back down but still slightly higher than usual- I have slowed my normal exercise routines down but I am experiencing tightness in chest.

Woke up morning of 2/19 and observed extensive petechiae and bloody nose consistent with low platelet count and ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura). I was previously diagnosed with ITP and platelet count was 262k confirmed by blood work a couple days before 2nd vaccine. Morning after got blood draw confirming platelets dropped to below 1k. Medical emergency and sent to ER. Admitted and received emergency treatment to increase platelet counts. Ended up requiring splenectomy on 2/22/21. Just discharged from hospital. Multiple medical providers advised me to submit report to VAERS.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

A 36-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry dates were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in arm right, on 02Feb2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated that he is a paramedic. He said everyone has been getting sick around him, and he had a coworker who recently tested positive with the COVID-19 Virus. He said when his coworker tested positive for the COVID-19 Virus, he figured he better get tested for the COVID-19 Virus, before he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He said his COVID-19 Virus test was negative on 02Feb2021, so he got his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He said he had symptoms after her received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He said at the time, he thought his symptoms were from the COVID-19 Vaccine, but now he believes he was probably exposed to the COVID-19 Virus and his symptoms were from a COVID-19 Virus exposure. He said he is schedule to get his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot on 22Feb2021. He asked now that he has tested positive for the COVID-19 Virus on 08Feb2021, does being positive for COVID-19 change if, and when, he should get his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported that he lost his sense of smell, and he knows that losing his sense of smell is not from receiving his first COVID- 19 Vaccine dose.

He said he felt better on day 3 (05Feb2021), but still was a little under-the-weather. He said on day 4 (06Feb2021) he couldn&#39;t smell anything at all, and his sense of taste started to go. He said he knows the COVID-19 Vaccine is not made from the actual live virus, so he had another COVID-19 Virus test performed this morning (08Feb2021), and he was positive for the COVID-19 Virus. He clarified he had a COVID-19 Virus nasal swab test performed this morning but does not know the name or manufacturer of the COVID-19 Virus test. Patient he got his first COVID-19 Vaccine on his right arm because he has tattoos on his left arm. Clarified he had a negative COVID-19 Virus test on 02Feb2021, right before receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on the same day (02Feb2021). Reported he has seen a pattern where people will initially test negative for the COVID-19 Virus and then will later test positive for the COVID-19 Virus. No further details provided. Reported he hasn&#39;t taken a decongestant or even Advil. No further details provided. Reported that he had minor, cold-like symptoms (tired, achy, and chills) that started the day after (03Feb2021). He said on 06Feb2021, he lost his sense of smell, and then he lost his sense of taste.

A 36-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: Em9810, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 08Feb2021 at 09:30 (age at vaccination was 36 years) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The facility where most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was other. Medical history included type 1 diabetes, asthma and allergy to sulfas. Concomitant medications included aspart (FIASP INSULIN), minerals nos, vitamins nos (CENTRUM), vitamin d nos and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC); the patient received all these within 2 weeks of vaccination, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) administered in right arm on 18Jan2021 at 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EI3302) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient was type 1 diabetic. On 08Feb2021 at 20:00 patients blood sugar was slightly elevated (170mg/dl) 12-24h post injection and severely elevated (200-270mg/dl) 24-32h after injection. More significantly his body was insulin resistant during that time. At time of writing, it was 35h past injection and blood sugar has normalized and insulin again started behaving normally. The event was reported as non-serious with no seriousness criteria (Results in death / Life threatening/ Caused/prolonged hospitalization/ Disabling/Incapacitating/ Congenital anomaly/birth defect). The outcome of the events was recovered/resolved in 2021.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose.

A 36-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number; Unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as SINGLE DOSE, dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 21Mar2021 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number; Unknown) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced he had symptoms of an illness (perhaps covid like symptoms) starting on 19mar2021 (between his 1st &amp; 2nd dose of pfizer biontech). (illness) on 18Mar2021, admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident) (hospitalization) on 08Apr2021. The patient was hospitalized for admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident) on 08Apr2021 in ICU currently/still as of 11Apr2021, not yet recovered. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 18Mar2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 08Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident). A 36 year old brother in law of my friend. He had symptoms of an illness (perhaps covid like symptoms) starting on 19Mar2021 (between his 1st &amp; 2nd dose of Pfizer BioNTech). He went ahead and got his 2nd dose on 21March2021. He then went to see his dr in the last week (week of 05Apr2021 I believe) because of not being well. That primary care dr thought the patient had perhaps been exposed to covid between the 1st &amp; 2nd doses (due to symptoms that the dr thought seemed like body&#39;s over-reaction to covid) but a covid test was done and it was negative. Then the patient has been admitted to (Hospital name) in (city name) (state name) suffering from a stroke on 08Apr2021. He still has not tested positive for covid (again) but he is in ICU at (Hospital name) with stroke symptoms. This was all related to my by the sister-in-law (my friend (name)). I wanted to report since the 2nd dose Pfizer BioNTech was taken on 21Mar2021 &amp; then in hospital ICU with a stroke (at 36 yrs old) on 08Apr2021. Hospitalized for 4 days in ICU currently/still as of 11Apr2021, not yet recovered, admitted with stroke on 08Apr2021. The outcome of the event for illness was unknown and for stroke was not recovered.  Information about Lot/batch number is requested.

                                                I received my second shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, March 20th at noon.  Saturday at midnight, I woke up in full body sweats and aches.  I took two ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep, but I would toss and turn in full body sweats and aches for the next 8 hours.  I took another 2 ibuprofen around 400am.  Sunday morning I woke up feeling OK, not great, but OK.  Sunday night ? it was very strange ? the full body chills and aches came back.  Not as bad as Saturday night, but they returned nevertheless.  I had another restless night of sleep, and I took another two rounds of ibuprofen to try and help me sleep.  Monday I woke up feeling OK again.  Monday evening, around 8:00pm, I could feel the full body chills and aches coming back again, creeping up slightly.  This time, I also felt a mild burning in my upper chest and throat.  I went to bed around 8:00pm, then woke up at 9:00pm, this time in a lot of pain.  It felt like burning and a stabbing sensation in my throat and upper chest.  I took some ibuprofen, and tried to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned in agony for the next few hours, apparently falling asleep at some point around 1:00am.  At 2:00am I woke up in severe pain again.  It was very bad, like an 8 out of a 10.  It felt like a burning and stabbing sensation in my lower throat and upper chest.  I had my wife call 911, and I was brought to hospital in an ambulance.  I would stay in the hospital for the next 3 days, getting discharged Thursday at around 5:00pm.  I had peak troponin levels of 5, so I basically had a moderate heart attack.  I had a cardiac catherization procedure done, as well as a cardiac MRI.  The cardiac catherization procedure showed I had no blockages at all in my arteries.  The cardiologists diagnosed me with myocarditis.  The cardiologists told me they believe the vaccine triggered a heavy response from my auto immune system.  The response from my auto immune system in turn caused my heart to become inflamed, giving me myocarditis.  It was a horrible experience, and my doctors are convinced that it was brought on by the second coronavirus vaccine shot that I received.

I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

                                                Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 at 15:15 hours.  A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

On 12/25,   seven days after  receiving the  shot  I started to get right lower leg pain and I kept complaining about it till New Years Day. I had no symptoms of a DVT.  I triaged on 1/1/21 and the doctors  ordered  labs/imaging  and the results were  as followed: D-Dimer  biomarker  (&#43;) , Ultrasound of the Rt lower leg ( - ) ,  CTA showed a PE (segmental right upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus). I  was discharged on  Xarelto and advised to follow  up with a hematologist. On 1/5/2021,  I went to hematology and they did a whole bunch of labs. I was sent to get a  ultrasound   of the leg because the pain persist and they found  a clot hidden by my soleus. The plan is to continue on the Xarelto for 6 months. Come back in 3 weeks to scan my leg again and get my lab results.  On 1/12/2021, I received the 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccination.

I had sudden onset SOB, chest tightness, audible upper airway wheezing. Symptoms persisted and worsened through the night prompting me to drive to the Emergency Dept.

                                                Developed flushing, diaphoresis, nausea, and eventually syncope about 18 hours after vaccine injection.  Got up in the night to check on my kids, had been standing for about 2-3 minutes when symptoms started, and passed out in the hallway about 60 seconds after symptom onset.  Recovered consciousness within a few seconds, had to lay on the floor for about 5 minutes due to nausea, then got back in bed and went back to sleep.  Woke up 3 hours later and felt completely fine except a little fatigue - all other symptoms had resolved.

A 38-years-old male patient started to receive 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142, Expiry Date: 01Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 30Dec2020 18:17 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was reported as &#39;None&#39; and AEs following prior vaccinations was reported as &#39;None&#39;. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was reported as None. The patient experienced really bad chills, body aches, fever, unable to sleep on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, passed out on bathroom floor for 5-10 seconds, sweating and neck was stiff on 01Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, headache on an unspecified data with outcome of unknown.  Details were as follows: the patient received the Covi-19 vaccine 30Dec2021. He had a reaction to the vaccine. 24 hours after getting the vaccine he had really bad chills, body aches, fever 100.4. He didn&#39;t take any medication for a bit. He then took acetaminophen (TYLENOL). He had a headache, he was unable to sleep. The acetaminophen worked and he went to bed. At 5:00 am he started having a bad headache and took Ibuprofen. He woke up to go to the bathroom. He passed out for 5-10 seconds in the bathroom. His head was leaning in the wall by the door. He was sweating and was stiff all over. He went to the Emergency Room on 01Jan2021. They did an X-ray and a CT scan. They gave him 100ml of saline and some pills. They also did some lab work. Everything was negative. They assumed his body couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. He was supposed to have received the second shot yesterday (20Jan2021). Employee Health said his Primary Care Physician would have to make the decision on him taking it or not. His doctor said he would have to do more research with Pfizer before he says if he can take it or not. Emergency Room visit required due to event passing out.

The worst occurred the day after when my body could no longer absorb insulin. I increased my basal rate by almost 400% and could not bring my sugars down. Saturday afternoon I began experiencing symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis: stomach pain, vomiting, high ketones and very high  blood sugars. I was able to eventually take in enough water to lower my ketones and sugar and narrowly avoided going to the ER, but high blood sugars and headache have persisted and I am still experiencing these symptoms.

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.
