A 40-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Batch/lot number: EK5730, via an unspecified route of administration on 26Dec2020 as a single dose (age at vaccination: 40 years old), right arm for COVID -19 immunization. Medical history included chronic back pain.  Concomitant medication included amitriptyline (AMITRIPTYLINE), cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) for chronic back pain, and hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (NORCO) for chronic back pain. On 26Dec2020, the patient had a &#34;near sick able episode&#34; and a rapid heart rate.  The initial side effect was about 7 minutes after the patient had the vaccine, came on just very quickly. The place where they had the patient discharged him, allowed him to go home, but the rapid heart rate stayed with the patient for next 24 hours and he went to an urgent care and they sent him to emergency room. The patient went to the emergency room (27Dec2020) and they ran an EKG, X-ray, and did a COVID swab; everything came back negative. Lab work, X-ray everything came back fine, the only thing they found was hypoglycemia, heart palpitations, and abnormal EKG, which was described by the reporter as &#34;normal sinus rhythm left axis deviation pulmonary disease pattern&#34; and then at the bottom it said &#34;abnormal EKG.&#34; Heart rate was 136/88 (as reported) so it was definitely improving, the highest it was at 189/110 (as reported). No treatment was received for the events. The clinical outcome of the events &#34;near sick able episode,&#34; rapid heart rate, and palpitations was recovering, while the clinical outcome of hypoglycemia and abnormal ECG was unknown.

A 40-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, lot number: EK5730, exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (vaccine location: left arm) on 18Dec2020 04:15 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy induced asthma, allergies to cats and dust, and occasional seasonal allergies. Concomitant medication included other vaccine/s received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine: first dose of diphtheria vaccine toxoid, pertussis vaccine acellular 3-component, tetanus vaccine toxoid (BOOSTRIX, GlaxoSmithKline) administered as single dose via unspecified route of administration (vaccine location: left arm) on 08Dec2020. There were no other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced persistent shortness of breath and chest tightness starting within a few days after vaccine (24Dec2020). Patient was poorly responsive to her inhalers that she used for asthma (onset date not reported). She rarely needed the, used about once or twice a year). It was constant, but with periods of improvement followed regression. Will likely seek medical evaluation as it&#39;s been over a week now and rather concerning. The patient did not consider the events shortness of breath and chest tightness as serious. Treatment for the adverse events shortness of breath and chest tightness included fluticasone propionate, almeterol (ADVAIR), albuterol, and unspecified anti-allergy medications. Patient did not have covid prior vaccination. Patient was tested for COVID post vaccination wherein patient tested negative for COVID via Covid test rapid on 30Dec2020. The adverse event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of shortness of breath and chest tightness was not recovered and unknown for the other event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of BNT162B2 to the events shortness of breath , chest tightness and asthma aggravated cannot be excluded.

COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his &#34;deconditioning&#34; in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.

                                                Within 8-10 minutes I had a wave of heat start from the back of my head to the front, like the feeling you get right before you go under from anesthesia. My heart began to race and I was lightheaded. I reported the reaction and was given an oximeter to check oxygen and heart rate. Heart rate was 140, oxygen 99. BP was also checked and was normal. Was given water and sat for another 10 minutes. Felt better and heart rate was under 100 until another wave of lightheadedness came over me and heart rate spiked again to over 120. It came down again. A few minutes later lightheadedness came back, shaking started, and heart rate spiked again. It lasted about 10 minutes. After 55 minutes of staying at facility I was able to leave. However, did have one more brief episode of lightheadedness and heart rate spiking. Sore arm and extreme ringing in one ear were only side effect the  following day.

Once he received the vaccine, he became nauseous, sweaty, clammy, dizzy and lightheaded. Pt explained to immunizer that he was switched to night shift and had taken his diabetic meds without food soon before his shift at 5:30pm. An EMT was on scene and she proceeded to call more medics.

Report 3 of 3. MI filed on report 1 of 3. A 40-year-old-male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (COVID VACCINE, Pfizer product, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot: Number: EL3302, NDC number: Unknown, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included sleep apnea (he started with CPAP and technically it was a BIPAP machine), bipolar disease (took psychiatric medications), lost weight, blood pressure and liver enzymes. On 17Mar2020, he quit smoking. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 26Jan2021, the patient experienced nasal congestion and cough. He had COVID test and it came back positive. It was reported that, &#34;they were vaccinated on 15Jan2021 with first dose. The Wednesday after which was about 5 days after the vaccine her husband got chills, sneezing, and fatigue. He did not call the doctor and did not get tested. About a week later her son had nasal congestion and cough. This was the third day for that. Called her son&#39;s doctor since this was the second person in the house to have symptoms. He had COVID test and it came back positive. Is the COVID vaccine enough to give a positive test. She had symptoms too, but she normally get sinusitis this time of year. No one had a fever. Her son was really congested. Maybe he will develop a fever down the line. She was at a quandary. She had to quarantine in case it was. Could the vaccination cause a positive COVID test result. She thought the symptoms should show up in 1 to 3 days. A week in between her husband and son and it was hard to believe. It should have been her to get it worse since she sleeps with her husband. Praise the Lord she had not. She and her husband had not been tested for COVID. Only her son was COVID tested. Wednesday morning he woke up and he was much more congested. He complained a little on Tuesday. He had sleep apnea and uses CPAP. He might have wanted cough medicine to help him sleep good. He said he did not sleep well. He was very tired and congested. On the evening of 26Jan2021 he was more congested than usual. He was tested yesterday and got positive results this morning. History and Investigations: he was in a lot better shape since living with them because he had lost over 100 pounds. He had sleep apnea. He started with CPAP and technically it was a BIPAP machine. They call it a CPAP. He was 355 pounds and now 228 pounds. Slowly loosing weight. He had bipolar disease and took psychiatric medications. Since he had lost weight he has had to decrease his doses. He was having problems with blood pressure in October. He was starting to feel faint and the doctor stopped his blood pressure medications. He had issues with his liver enzymes and he was not out of the woods yet. He had been a smoker on and off. He quit smoking on 17Mar2020. Caller declined to do provide information about her son&#39;s psychiatric medications and blood pressure medications for report. They bought a blood pressure cuff to keep track of his blood pressure. Since he got sick his blood pressure went up to 121/63. It was normally 110 to 114 over 63 to 70. She had also been keeping an eye on his temp and it went up about a degree. His pulse rate was up which you would expect. His pulse rate was usually between 55 and 68. That day it was 83. There was a product complaint. Caller was patient&#39;s mother. Vaccinated on 15Jan2021 with first dose. About a week later her son had nasal congestion and cough. This was the third day for that. Called her son&#39;s doctor since this was the second person in the house to have symptoms. He had COVID test and it came back positive. Is the COVID vaccine enough to give a positive test. Her son was really congested. Maybe he would develop a fever down the line. Could the vaccination cause a positive COVID test result. On the evening of 26Jan2021 he was more congested than usual. He was tested yesterday and got positive results this morning. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Heart rate and blood pressure was higher than normal. EKG looked normal but with higher heart rate. Started feeling better in an hour and went home. The high heart rate recurred the next several days but would go away after few minutes.  Occasionally I get a headache and feel resting heart rate is higher than before. Definitely feeling better after two weeks compared to day of the shot.

A 40-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscularly, administered in arm left on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 40-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension and COVID-19 prior to vaccination; patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included lisinopril. Patient had no other vaccine in four weeks and the COVID vaccine was received at a Public Health Clinic/Veterans Administration facility. On 15Mar2021, the patient experienced thrombocytopenia (109,000), elevated D dimer (3960), fatigue, subjective fever, headache, sweats, injection site pain and paresthesias of hand on side of injection. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was tested for COVID post-vaccination through a nasal swab and Biofire PCR on 22Mar2021 which were both negative. Therapeutic measure taken as a result of the events included IV hydration. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and close temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product bnt162b2 and all reported events.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

On Mon heart rate increased again. Went to Urgent Care and tested covid negative. On Wed 12/30, BP at 180/105. Went to ED and BP eventually went down to 145/95. Dr is speculating that since patient had high antibodies from covid infection in August and still high antibodies in October that all of this is a wild immune reaction triggered by the vaccine.

He was sitting in a designated chair for the protocol 15 min observation and fell from the chair to the ground, hitting the right side of his temporal - redness noted around area with skin intact. Clinic staff immediately moved patient to be lying down on the ground with cervical spine precaution and lifted his legs up on a chair. Vitals: HR 78 and BP 118/72 taken in supine position on ground with legs elevated. Patient was transported by EMS to the ED at 2:45pm. ED note: Patient has Hx of vasovagal syncope in the past with similar symptoms after blood draws..Exam and workup shows well-appearing young man, nonfocal neuro exam, normal gait, cardiopulmonary exam unremarkable, no signs of trauma other than a small hematoma to the right forehead. After evaluation, their Canadian Syncope Risk Score is -3 indicating very low risk for 30 day serious adverse events (&lt;1%). Telemetry monitoring during their ED stay has not captured any events. Discussed next steps with patient: given their low risk for 30 day serious adverse events (including death, serious arrhythmia, MI, PE, ICH), they would prefer to be discharged to continue their workup as an outpatient, rather than admission for observation. Patient was deemed stable to discharged from the ED at 5:57pm with counseling to follow up with PCP in the next 2 days and to return to the ED with any persistent or worsening symptoms.

                                                Patient screened for first dose of Pfizer vaccine. He checked no history of allergies or reactions to medications or vaccines. In the initial screening he informed me he had a phobia of needles but this is usually with blood draws. He reported he should be fine with vaccinations. I inquired on previous reactions and he denied any allergic reaction just that he does not like them. I asked him how I can help give the vaccine. We had him look away and to think of a different situation. I asked him if he would like to know when I am administering or just use distraction. He chose to be informed when he would feel a slight poke. Vaccine was administered with no issues.  Within the minute following the vaccine patient started to feel dizzy. Hung his head a bit but was responsive. I requested staff assistance to help the situation including RN to prevent any episodes of syncope.  We provided water which he was able to drink. He was still seated and we suggested putting head between legs. This was not comfortable for him so we moved him to the floor. About 3-4 min in he began to sweat a bit more and appeared Pale. We obtained a BP and pulse. BP was 112/60 and pulse around 60.  When he felt hot, sweaty and appeared pale we all decided to call EMS to be cautious. He maintained BP, no SOB, did not lose conscious. EMS evaluated him, med list provided and vitals. He was on medications for anxiety.  They released him after about 30min and reported a panic attack and not related to the vaccine.  Patient walked out of the clinic with his partner and was stable. He is requesting 2nd dose of the vaccine. I informed him nurse would review and would have a plan for future injection.

These all occurred about 12 hours after the second shot and subsided around 36 hours after the second shot.  8.5 days after the second shot I had throat and chest pain.  This pain then continued and got worse to the point I went to the ER and was evaluated for potential heart attack.  After testing - results were that I did not have a heart attack.  I was still experiencing this pain, so the ER took a strep test.  This was also negative.  The diagnosis was &#34;pulled chest muscle&#34;.  I&#39;ve had pulled muscles, I know what those feel like and it sure didn&#39;t feel like what I experienced on the night of the 16th and the day of the 17th of Feb. 2021.

For the next 6 days experienced debilitating headaches, which led to nausea (because they were so severe). Elevated blood pressure also coupled with headaches.  I initially took Ibuprofen (which helped somewhat), whereas Tylenol did nothing. I also have a flexible ice pack that I placed over my head. That also helped a little. I went to the doctor on March 17th, but he was dismissive of the headaches being related to the vaccine. I have since been referred to  a neurologist (April 1st appointment).

                                                The patient is a 41 yo male with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis who experienced DVT and PE temporally related to Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine dose #2 receipt.  He is a Service Member and reported  high levels of baseline activity, including running 10 miles each Saturday. He received vaccine #1 25 JAN 21 (EN5318) without AE. He received dose #2 on 16 FEB 21, (EN6200). He experienced no immediate symptoms suggestive of IgE event. On day 1 he reports feeling cold, mild fatigue but no other symptoms. On day 2 he was baseline. On day 3 he noted numbness, tightness  and discomfort to his right  calf. On day 4 (Saturday), his usual long run day, he experienced dyspnea and lightheadedness after running 20-30 feet. He states he noted tightness in his calf and instead walked the track while his wife completed her run. He rested day 5.  Day 6 he noted significant edema to his calf, which he describes as double normal in size, and iced it. Day 7, he tried to schedule with PCP and based on triage was sent to ER. ER diagnosed R DVT and bilateral PE&#39;s. He was admitted overnight, started anticoagulation therapy. He saw hematology, and the workup was negative for other causes.

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included drug hypersensitivity from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Allergic to sulfa, PCN and amoxicillin. The patients concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date the patient experienced sleep for a few minutes, I didnt pass out but it was similar, was pulled over for minor traffic violation. He was told to get out of the car and had a field sobriety test, and I looked intoxicated, felt heavy and tired/run down, had a headache, bad diarrhea, upset stomach, sleep for a few minutes, I didnt pass out but it was similar, crashed for 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day which I never do, aching, overall weakness, started feeling sick again at dinner, he went to the bathroom a few times, woke up feeling really bad. The patient was worried because everything was coming to a head right now. The caller got the first shot, he waited for 15 minutes and felt fine. As the caller walked to his car he began feeling heavy, had severe diarrhea, headache, aching, it was almost like he passed out, it felt like he went to sleep. The patient got home and crashed 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day and woke up feeling really bad. The patient went to a very important dinner meeting that night. While the patient was at the meeting he went to the bathroom a few times and then excused himself because he felt so bad. The patient did not even finish one cocktail with dinner. The caller got pulled over for a minor traffic stop, cutting the corner and crossing the line or something small. The officers believed the caller was driving under the influence and started making him do a sobriety test with 40 degree wind gusts, the patient was miserable. The caller told the officers that he needed to seek medical attention but they ignored him. The officers forced the caller to do the urine test. It has been 5 days since his vaccination and he is just now feeling better. The outcome of events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed.  No further information is expected.

Denies any fevers recorded at home. He feels like he has extra beats intermittently. Also reports some nausea, but denies vomiting or diarrhea. He has maintained good PO intake since symptoms started, but is worried he may be a bit dehydrated because he had a small AKI when he had covid back in March?.  Etiology of chest pains unclear, but given all of the above workup, unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac or pulmonary etiology.&#34;  He continued to have palpitations for the next week and had further EKG&#39;s don thru urgent care.

                                                About 3 minutes after receiving the shot, I became dizzy.  After 15 minutes, I was still dizzy.  I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

                                                I have a history of auto immune anemia and ITP.  I checked with my hematologist when scheduled if I should take the shot.  They stated to take it as not enough data was present to prevent me to take.  On 02/11, I spoke with doctors onsite and discussed my medical history.  They advised to take the shot as not enough data was present to prevent me to take.  On 02/14, I noticed bleeding in gums and petechiae at the injection site.  I went to hematologist on 02/15, and platelets were at 2,000.  I started 60 mg of prednisone immediately on 02/15.  By 02/19, took blood sample and eceived one 70g dose of IVIG.  Blood results came back on 02/20, and platelets were at 22,000 but did not cover results from after IVIG treatment.  Hematologist decided to stop follow up IVIG treatment and stick to 60mg of prednisone daily as in the past my body has reacted well to it.  On 02/24, platelet count went to 300,000.  I&#39;ve started to taper prednisone to 50mg and will continue with weekly blood tests to verify that platelets remain strong.  Hemoglobin and all over blood levels in the CBC remained normal during this time.  Hematologist has advised not to take second Pfizer COVID-19 shot due to risk.

When I went to see that patient, he was laying on the floor with his eyes rolled in the back of his head and was unresponsive. He was not alert. He started having a mild seizure and I rolled him over on his left side. While I was bracing the patient, pharmacist came in and administered an Epi-pen to his left thigh. Patient stopped seizing so I rolled him back on his back. He became alert and was able to provide me his name, DOB and what he was at the pharmacy for. I rested my hand under his head and monitored his pulse until the paramedics arrived

                                                Pt was found in severe distress in the bathroom by his wife.  He couldn&#39;t walk or stand, complained of being dizzy with slurred speech and was throwing up a lot. 911 was immediately called. The EMTs during their assessment said his BP was normal but when he was asked his name, he started saying the alphabet&#34;ABC... XYZ&#34;.  He was transported by ambulance to ER. Cat scan showed he had a bleed on the brain.  The doctors told us it was because he had very high blood pressure, however where the bleed was, they said he wouldn&#39;t need surgery and that the body would reabsorb it over time.  He was admitted to the ICU and has been there ever since.  Several days later, he started having difficulty breathing and they discovered several blood clots in his right leg that had broken off into his heart and lungs.  He had emergency surgery to remove the clots in his heart (approximately 10) and was given heparin in small doses over an 8 hour period so that it wouldn&#39;t cause the bleed in his brain to increase.  The doctor should fill in the rest.

Patient stated that he got his shot on Monday 12Apr2021 (he confirmed it was his first dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) and then went on 14Apr2021 his heart started to beat fast, he read on the fact sheet and he asked if that may be a sign he had an allergic reaction. He went to his doctor, her EKG came back normal, he saw a cardiologist. He asked if he should get second dose. Second was scheduled for 03May2021. He didn&#39;t know either. As per response it was reported that as noted in the fact sheet for recipients, patient should not get the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE if he had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if he had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason could not be made by Pfizer. They referred him to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. His healthcare provider knew his health situation and had access to information that could better help inform this decision. The patient experienced dull pain: caller reported that on Wednesday, 14Apr2021, after his heart started beating fast and slowed itself down, it started to hurt. The patient reported that the dull pain was not as bad. The patient had EKG on 14Apr2021 with abnormal result (as reported). The outcome of the event &#39;dull pain: caller reported that on Wednesday, 14Apr2021, after his heart started beating fast and slowed itself down, it started to hurt&#39; and &#39;heart started to beat fast&#39; was recovering; outcome of the remaining event was unknown.

They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

                                                About 4 hours after injection.  My heart started to race and it progressively increased to the point where the resting rate was anywhere from 130-160 beats per minute.  When I would move it would increase to the 180s.  As of today, the 21st, my resting heart rate has decreased to the 100s and when I move it increases to the 110s.

                                                I had some sort of reaction.  I was glad to get the shot and was not nervous about getting the shot. 5 minutes after the shot I felt something cold go down my left arm from my shoulder to my hand.  A minute or two after that both my hands went numb, then both my arms went numb.  I asked others around me if anyone felt anything and everyone else was fine.  A minute or two after that both my legs went numb. I started to black out but made it to a chair before this happened,  I drank some cold water and felt awake about 5 minutes later.  30 minutes after that i felt comfortable enough to walk.  For the rest of the day i felt like i was legally drunk and felt lots of pins and needles on the back of my hands and feet. I did not feel dizzy or nauseous at that time. i also felt a lot of pressure on the inside of my skin all over my body. I&#39;ve never felt anything like that and it was a bit uncomfortable.  The next day i was too dizzy to walk without becoming very nauseous.  I still had pins and needles on my feet. i had chills as well which i guess is a good sign.  my appetite was fine. i felt clear-headed as well.  Two days after the shot i felt slightly dizzy and by the third day i felt fine except for minor muscle cramps all over my body.  For the three days after the shot i also had some pretty strong forearm and calf muscle cramps and my arms (biceps and triceps) felt pumped up like i just had a great arm workout, but they weren&#39;t swollen at all.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

During evaluation BP was found to be elevated (160 or 180&#43;/100&#43; approximately (don&#39;t recall exact numbers).  Within an hour subsided enough for me to return to work, and dizziness subsided over the next several days.  Similar reaction to booster dose on 2/16/21; less acute but dizziness continues 1 month later.  Severity is not debilitating at this time.

Severe myalgias - in the epigastric cisternal area and in the back of my shoulder blades. 36 hours later - low grade temperature. At 48 hours I felt normal. Eye - 10 days later (vaccine) - I noticed a visual deficit in the left eye along with a line and the following day - on the 17th, I saw my ophthalmologist - left branch retinal vein occlusion.  Since then I&#39;ve had an Forestine Angiogram:  and a video of my retina - branch retina arterial occlusion - so they are having trouble telling the difference between the two. I still am being followed for my eye. They did a carotid ultrasound - my carotids are fine. I am due to get an echo cardiogram. I am taking baby aspirin mg for now - not sure if it&#39;s helping or not. It takes a year and a half to go away.

                                                massive heart attack; knee pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 43-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Mar2021 12:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart attack in 2019, heart disorder (Heart),  Blood cholesterol abnormal (cholesterol), hurt his knee at work prior and torn meniscus. Concomitant medications included ongoing ticagrelor (BRILINTA) for the heart; ongoing atorvastatin for cholesterol and ongoing carvedilol (COREG) for the heart. The patient previously took clopidogrel (PLAVIX) for heart attack. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No adverse events following prior vaccinations. The patient called about the COVID 19 vaccine. He received his first COVID-19 vaccine on 12Mar2021 and suffered a massive heart attack on the same day. After the event, his cardiologist reviewed video from the heart catherization to open the blockage and the cardiologist indicated that the area that was obstructed with this heart attack had not been obstructed 2 months ago. The cardiologist believed that the COVID 19 vaccine is the culprit in causing the massive heart attack. The cardiologist believed the area of the blockage was too dramatic. The cardiologist encouraged the caller to report the event and the cardiologist will offer his expertise in this matter if needed. The patient also tried to report to his local health department but is waiting on a call back from them. He reported that he had a heart attack in 2019. He was taking Plavix but after this heart attack his cardiologist has changed some of his medications. He reported he believes his medications were changed at his follow up visit with the cardiologist on 23Mar2021. He reported that he had continuous blood work done while in the hospital. They were monitoring his troponin levels. He also had a chest X-Ray, EKG and after the heart attack he had an echocardiogram to monitor the extent of the damage caused by the heart attack. He clarified that he did go to the emergency department on 12Mar2021, the same day he received the Covid 19 vaccine, but for knee pain. He received a pain relief injection of fentanyl that day. He had hurt his knee at work prior. He had previously had an MRI of his knee that showed a torn meniscus. He does not believe his knee pain on 12Mar2021 is related to the Covid 19 vaccine as he had already had an MRI that showed a torn meniscus. He had gone to the emergency department for pain management of his knee. He thought he would be given a lower strength pain medication but received Fentanyl. While the patient was at the emergency room for his knee, he suffered a massive heart attack. The patient clarified that he went to the emergency department because of pre-existing knee pain and while at the emergency department caller suffered a massive heart attack. The patient was hospitalized for massive heart attack from 12Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The outcome of the event heart attack was recovering while the outcome of the event knee pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal association between BNT162B2 and the massive heart attack cannot be completely excluded. The knee pain was assessed as an intercurrent condition and is unrelated to BNT162B2.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 44-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EH9899) 1st dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 in the evening time (around 6-7 or maybe a little later) at single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the COVID Vaccine that same day, his heart rate went up and then it came down and he was fine. Later that night while sleeping he got up again because he could feel his heart rate going up. It was not way up, but he could tell it was up. He was trying to catch an actual reading on the monitor of his heart rate, but he was not able to before it came back down. He was calling because he is wondering if this was considered a severe allergic reaction. He got the vaccine and was able to walk to his car. His mouth got dry right after the vaccine within a minute or two and noticed his heart rate went up. Treatment: He took some deep breaths and drunk water and it got better. He drove home, but that at nighttime while sleeping he noticed his heart rate went up a couple of times, but then it came back down. He could not get a reading of heart rate right away. The highest he saw on the monitor that he was able to capture was 101 and then it came back down. He was not sure if this was because he was nervous. He just had a couple of episodes that night and then nothing again. He also experienced his arm being sore from the vaccination. However, he stated that is to be expected. He stated the arm sore started a few days after getting the COVID Vaccine and then it was gone. Stated he was calling because he was concerned because Pfizer said to report any issues. He started to feel better and added this may not even be an issue. He just got concerned. Mentioned he was not sure if real side effects or if he was over thinking things. Outcome of the events was resolved.

His PCR and antigen test was negative at that time (08Jan2021); a retest of PCR done 5 days after sxs started (unclear of time window) was negative. He was concerned that he had the fever many days after the vaccine. HCP was asking if any cases of fever and fatigue reported after 7 days (around the 10 day mark) of receiving the first dose. He stated that he is planning on taking the second dose. The patient is a physician calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine. He received his first dose on 28Dec2020.

About 4 or 5 days after the symptoms started, he had an outpatient repeat pcr test and nucleic acid rapid test (unspecified dates) and they both came back negative. He is on his way to get his second dose and he is asking if the symptoms could be side effects from the vaccine. Outcome the event fever was recovered on an unspecified date. Outcome of nausea and shortness of breath was recovered on 08Jan2021, while outcome of pain at injection site left shoulder was recovered on 28Dec2020. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

I was started on Eliquis initially, but then had worsening symptoms on 2/4/21 and switched to Lovenox injections.   Symptoms have been slowly improving since then.

He is currently a highway patrol officer. While driving in his patrol car, at 1035, he felt tightness in the back of his neck and tightness to his airway- he described it feeling like someone hit him in the neck. He denied having any trouble breathing. Later, he noted his hand was twitching. 1045, he came back to lobby and made an RN aware who brought him to employee health. He declined to go to ED (I found out later).  BP was 153/115 HR 102  initially, no hx of high bp.  No noted hives or swelling to face or mouth/tongue or L deltoid region.  Pt. denied feeling any itching anywhere.  Pt. rested for about 15 minutes on exam table. Re-check of BP was 151/113 HR 84.  Pt. states he feels better and feel like that feeling of tightness in his neck is decreasing.   Made aware to follow up with PCP regarding BP and giving informational handout regarding blood pressure.  RN recommended he go to any ED if he has any trouble breathing, swelling of tongue, etc at any time after he leaves this hospital. Pt. verbalized understanding.

The patient requested a chair to sit down and the Paramedic assisted the patient to do so. The patient expressed verbally to the Paramedic having a difficulty with needles and subsequently the patient lost consciousness while on the chair but maintaining a pulse and a hoarse respiration (snoring). Thereafter the patient was placed on a medical code in supine position with an immediate clearing of hoarse respiration. Evaluation by the Paramedic revealed an intact HEENT, (continued on page 2)...

The pain became worse over the next several days resulting in what I&#39;d describe as an electrical shock/burning feeling whenever I moved my left arm the wrong way (seemingly pinching the lymph nodes). I&#39;m currently on day 5 of the pain and it&#39;s still present although it has lessened on the 5th day. On the 2nd day the pain started to move down from the armpit closer to the pectoral.

A 44-years-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Feb2021 17:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at hospital. Medical history included coronary artery disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unknown date for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not have covid before vaccination. The patient experienced small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. These events were serious as life threatening, disability and requiring hospitalization from 21Feb2021 till 23Feb2021 at 14:00. On 20Feb2021 07:00 the patient experienced headache, chill, running nose, shortness of breath with outcome of recovering. The patient experienced also pains in chest on 21Feb2021 11:00 with outcome of recovering and injection location had redness, hardness on an unspecified date with outcome of recovering. Clinical course was as follows. 19Feb2021-5:45pm the patient went to receive vaccine shot. 20Feb2021 the patient had headache, chill, runny nose, and shortness of breath. 21Feb2021 11am still had shortness of breath and pains in chest. Went to clinic had a rapid Covid test come back negative, pain increased and he went to emergency room. The patient was admitted to the hospital with small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues. Inflammatory response seems to possibly triggered possible underlying issue of minor heart disease. Then induced heart attack and myocardial issue. The patient would gladly be admitted to a clinic for observation and testing to assist Pfizer in understanding this unfortunate situation. The injection location had redness, hardness. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment due to the event which included multiple lab tests, Angiogram, CR scan and pain medicine.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

After the second dose, I found I have more frequent cardiac arrhythmia and now it is more frequent. Sometimes I also felt chest pain. As a scientist, I started to think about the possibilities. I think my current heart problem is associated with COVID-19 vaccine. It is possible antibodies raised against the spike protein generated from muscle cells cross-react with a protein in the heart and cause the problem. I am going to visit a family doctor or cardiologist to see what is going on in my heart.

I felt like my heart rate raised a couple of times a day. The spikes in my blood pressure and heart rate lasted about four days. It felt a little like an anxiety attack. I was prescribed a Diuretic which  I took for a week. When you got the second dose I did not have any of the same symptoms.

                                                Patient received his second Pfizer vaccine on Friday. Saturday he came down with symptoms that we considered were like the stereotypical second dose. Fever, cough, shortness of breath, coming and going. It lingered until Tuesday, at which time he got a Covid test- negative. Went to dr, and he said there was a possibility of blood clots. Tests showed that he had severe pulmonary embolisms in both lungs- the main and 3 secondary arteries.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included chronic back pain, degenerative disc disease, and Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) colitis; the patient had no risk factors for cardiac disease other than obesity; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took cyclobenzaprine and pregabalin (LYRICA) and experienced allergies. It was unknown if the patient had other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Apr2021, 8 hours after the 2nd Pfizer vaccine was received, the patient developed chest pain with dyspnea. It was also reported that on 08Apr2021, troponin trended to 19; electrocardiogram (EKG) showed very subtle diffuse ST elevations; and the symptoms were consistent with myocarditis. All the adverse events (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit; an emergency room/department or urgent care; and hospitalization on an unspecified date for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included other/Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-at assay: negative on 10Apr2021 (post vaccination). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events, which included colchicine and ibuprofen. The patient was recovering from all the events.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Information provided was so limited to prevent a meaningful medical assessment. Other than a temporal association, there was no evidence or argument suggesting a causal relationship for BNT162B2 in the reported events, serious due to hospitalization. Otherwise, this patient did not show risk factors for cardiac disease, except for obesity. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

                                                Got vaccine at 9:41AM on Monday Feb. 15. In the evening of the same day, around 7h30 PM while I was sitting on a table talking to my parents, I had a nosebleed, not very bad, just about 10 drops of blood. I had not had nosebleed for  8 or 10 years before that night. I thought it might be because of the dryness in my house, humidity dropped to 30%  from the normal range of 40%-60%. However, last night (Tuesday night) around the same time 7:00pm ~ 7:30pm, I had a nosebleed again while having dinner with my family, a bit less blood dropping this time, but it makes me worried a little bit.    Other than the nosebleed, I don&#39;t have any other symptoms, the soreness on the injection arm is close to nothing and I usually forgot about it.

Covid test type post vaccination included nasal swab on 26Jan2021 with result negative, nasal swab on15Feb2021 with result negative, blood test on in Feb2021 with result negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for events pyrexia, cough, fatigue and short of breath.  The events atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmia and tachycardia are considered not related to BNT162B2, but rather due to underlying medical conditions.

We put the patient on the floor and elevated his legs and feet. His color came back to normal. Paramedics were dispatched because of his underlying medical condition. Paramedics checked his blood sugar and it was 145. Patient became very dizzy again when paramedics helped him to sit in a chair so patient decided to go to hospital with them to be checked out.

As the days have gone on it?s gotten a little worse. Left under arm pain, armpit area, left chest (pectoral) pain. Just lingering pain. Very sensitive to the touch. I also developed a rash on the left side of my spine between the shoulder blades. It  showed up this past weekend or the end of last week. It?s more of a painful rash than itchy. It?s very uncomfortable to lean against or lay on.  This is all 13 days after the second shot. I have just been taking ibuprofen for the pain.  Going to see my doctor today.

                                                Sore arm; Muscle cramps all over the body; Sugar was very high; Dehydrated; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 46-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 27Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack (at the age of 39) and had couple of stents (and the things done) later after that, and Lyme disease (past this Summer). The patient was taking several concomitant medications (unspecified). The patient&#39;s mother was calling for her son (patient) as he works out on the road, but he has had a heart attack at 39 years old and has had some other problems. The patient got his first Pfizer shot and about 2 to 3 days later while he was working, he first just had the sore arm on 03Mar2021. The patient worked in fiber glass repair on pools and it was very warm, and he started having muscle cramps all over the body on 03Mar2021. The patient ended up in the hospital on 03Mar2021 and his sugar was very high, and he was dehydrated. As treatment taken for the events, they gave him fluids through an IV and they gave him metformin medication 500 mg. The patient underwent laboratory tests and procedures (his doctor did the laboratory work), and they did laboratory work at the hospital where he went. It was clarified that they just did blood work on 03Mar2021, but the patient&#39;s mother didn&#39;t know what it was. The patient was just held for observation and was out the next day (04Mar2021). That was only the first shot, so the patient was really afraid to get the second shot one. The patient&#39;s mother told him she will try to find out something about it. patient&#39;s mother looked up the side effects and she did not see that as a side effect. At the time of reporting, the patient still had cramps once in a while. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Muscle cramps all over the body&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                a 46-year-old male with no known past medical history who initially presented complaining of headache and neck stiffness with onset the morning of 04/03/2021.  The patient states that his headache was initially gradual in onset and eventually decreased in severity on 4/5 however, on 04/06 after a day at the beach the patient developed a severe headache with rapid onset that he described as the worst headache in his life.  He did try to medicate himself at home with 600-800 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hr with minimal decrease in his headache pain.  As result he presented to  urgent care for initial evaluation who sent him to the emergency department for possible brain bleed.  On arrival to the emergency department the patient had a head CT which showed trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basilar cisterns likely due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm.  He was transferred to  for continued workup of the subarachnoid hemorrhage with CTA and possible IR intervention.  At time my evaluation patient was resting comfortably in the bed.  He continued to complain of severe headache and neck stiffness.  He additionally notes that light and loud sounds make his headache worse.  He denied any focal weakness, paresthesia&#39;s, numbness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or any other concerning neuro symptoms.  Patient was hypertensive during my evaluation despite being on a Cardene drip.  Patient&#39;s mother was at bedside and was able to assist with history.

                                                On March 25, 8 days after the vaccine shot in my left arm, I began experiencing intense pain on the left side of my neck and head. By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

Pulse-oximetry applied revealed normal spO2, but tachycardia to 140bpm (this patient&#39;s resting HR is approximately 55-65).  Apple Watch data confirmed rapid increase in HR at that moment.  BP increased from normal baseline to about 150-160 SBP.  No chest pain reported.  No signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis (rash, wheezing, etc.).  HR gradually recovered to normal levels within 30 minutes and patient was released after 60 min observation.  Patient reported generalized fatigue in weeks following injection.   Nineteen (19) days after injection, patient developed unprovoked resting tachycardia to approximately 180bpm (following some moderate weigh-lifting exercise).  Symptoms did no resolve sufficiently and patient was transported by EMS to ER for evaluation

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

I also experienced headache, vertigo, chest heaviness, vertigo, and chills for 3 days  following the vaccine.  Still have the ringing.  I cancelled the 2nd vaccine.

This 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; borderline diabetes. Concomitant medications included losartan; alirocumab (PRALUENT, injection) on 20Jan2021. Since 23Jan2021, patient was dizzy all along and almost fainted and was still having symptoms of mild migraine and he don&#39;t know like some light sensitivity. Doctor believed it was from vaccine. Patient was wondering how long was this going to be last as he had second shot coming out. He didn&#39;t think it was an adverse reaction and he thought he should get the second shot. But this was continuing to me and it had already been two weeks and patient still having symptoms of mild migraine. Patient was worried about taking the second shot as a result. He had never had a migraine before and was told it was probably from the vaccine and that was not something he wanted to hear. Patient wanted to know if this was normal to still be having this side effect for this long. Patient was taking acetaminophen (for migraine), it was not a TYLENOL, it was from a different brand. Patient did liver and cholesterol test and blood test in Jan2021 at Cardiologist and they came back fine, nothing was found there. The outcome of event migraine was not resolved. The outcome of rest events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He presented to the emergency room with the a several day history of fluctuating blood pressure and nausea/vomiting and generally feeling very poorly.  He has been having a lot of new onset health issues lately and so his wife and family were concerned.  He was brought into the emergency room.  He denies any severe abdominal pain.  However, he states he has been feeling extremely nauseous.  He is vomited at least once a day for the last 5 days.  He does admit that he is under an extraordinary amount of stress between his new onset Parkinson&#39;s, his insurance business, and his full-time job as a pastor.  The patient also does have a history of alpha-gal allergy.  He states it is possible he ate some cross contaminated meat, but states that this nausea and vomiting does not act like his typical response to eating something that he is allergic to.   The patient states that about a month and a half his neurologist did increase his Requip up from 0.5 mg 3 times a day to 1.5 mg 3 times per day.  However, it has never made him nauseous before.  He denies any definite chest pain.  He denies any exertional dyspnea.  He does admit that his blood pressure has been fluctuating for quite some time.  He states he was having a skin biopsy done last week and they almost abandon the procedure because his blood pressure was so high.  He currently takes a combination of Benicar and hydrochlorothiazide.   In the emergency room his lipase was found to be a little bit elevated.  Creatinine was found to be a little bit elevated.  His blood pressure was very elevated in the systolic 170 range and he did require some IV labetalol.  The patient states he really has not missed any doses of his medications.

I left the hospital, start driving, and suddenly felt that my right arm was heavy, numb, with a tingling sensation. I stopped the car and called the nurse and I was told that it will go away, and I can take a tylenol/motrin. It improved over the next hour and I felt it resolved a few days later but then it returned on 1/18 but not to the same extent, and I also felt intermittent tingling and numbing in my right foot. I also experienced intermittent episodes of fast heartbeats and missing heartbeats since the vaccine almost daily. I was fatigued and extremely thirsty for 3 days but that resolved completely.

So much that I was worried my muscles would begin to sieze up and cramp.  I had warm clothes and 5 blankets and could not get warm for over 2 hours.  Elevated heart rate and breathing.  Nothing warmed me.  Eventually (and with ibuprofen) the incident subsided.  I felt weak and just &#34;off&#34; with slight body aces and fatigue for the next day and a half.

Felt fine Monday morning. Monday about 11 am began to feel tightness in chest, thought it was bad heartburn. Pain kept me awake Monday night, and continued into Tuesday morning. Called the doctor, was sent to urgent care. Urgent care detected elevated tritonin and had me transported to the emergency room. Elevated heart rate and rising tritonin levels had me admitted to the hospital. Given heperin and a beta-blocker, given a CT scan, and monitored over night. On Wednesday had a echocardiogram and then a heart catherter and imaging, which showed a healthy heart, no plaque, no blockages. Tritonin levels and heart rate returned to normal. Released from hospital on evening of 3/10.

                                                The night after my first shot, I felt pressure on my lungs, It felt as if I had the onset of Pleurisy as I have had that issue in the past.  I figure I would wait to get it treated as it is not always picked up in the x-ray in its infant stages (based on past experience).  On March 2, the pain became unbearable and I went into a urgent care center to get an x-ray and something to help with my issue.  The urgent care did not take my x-ray they immediately sent me to the hospital strongly intimating that the problem was probably more serious than I thought.  I was in the emergency room, they ran tests and made me comfortable enough as they also gave me a ct-scan which is when they found the bi-lateral pulmonary embolisms.  I have since gone to my primary care physician and he directed me to a hematologist/oncologist.  The event was found to be unprovoked.  I am on blood thinners for 6 months.

                                                Background, I had Covid back at the end of May/beginning of June with 1 week of constant fevers (with 500mg tylenol q6), shortness of breath, fatigue, but no real cough. O2 sats somtimes in low 90&#39;s . I am one of the radiology faculty at the hospital I work at. Received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday Dec 18 at about 21:30. After the injection, I had moderate pain at the site of injection about 6 hours later, not unexpected. However, the next evening, I was feeling fatigued and went to bed at about 7 p.m. For the next three hours, I felt chills and finally at about 10 p.m. I took my temp after I felt that my fever had &#34;broke&#34; and temp was 101.9. Used a finger pulse ox just to make sure sats were ok, they were at 97%, but unexpectedly, resting heart rate was 130 bpm. I took some tylenol and called the ER, and they suggested calling the covid hotline pager and coming in if I did not improve. I called the hotline pager, and we discussed things and eventually decided that I should go to the ER as temp remained at 101.6. By the time I reached the ER, my temp was down to 100.8, but pulse still 122 (EKG with no other abnormalities) and BP was 165/100. I had no other symptoms to account another infection. Over the next two hours, vitals became more normal with HR down to 95 to 100, and BP down to 145/85 or so without any other intervention.  Sunday, still with some mild low grade temps of 99.8, but heart rate at 85 to 90 (I&#39;m usually at about 80).   In the ER, we came to the conclusion that my body mounted a significant immune response to the production of antigens after processing the mRNA given the lack of alternative diagnosis and the improvement of sx without any other intervention besides the 500 mg of tylenol I took before coming in.

A 49-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported) via unspecified route of administration in the arm right on 21Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced drug allergy; also received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EJ1685) via unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Dec2020 14:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: clinic. It was reported that on 23Jan2021, couple of days after the second shot, patient experienced skin on hands and the bottom of my feet started to peel off and bleeding and very painful in the fingers and the feet.  The events resulted in both: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, and Emergency room/department or urgent care. It was unknown if treatment received for the events. Outcome of all events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship and known drug profile, a contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded in the development of bleeding, skin exfoliation and pain in extremity.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 49-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199 and expiration date not provided) intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 16Mar2021 13:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has no relevant medical history. Family history included diabetes (mother). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200 and expiration date not provided) Injected intramuscularly in left upper arm on 23Feb2021, 13:30 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced DVT symptoms, soft tissue injury, muscle pull and ankle strain. The patient experienced DVT left lower extremity and bilateral pulmonary emboli on 23Apr2021. The patient called regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He had adverse events to report. He has a DVT on his left calf, which he later clarified was left lower extremity. He is currently on double dose of apixaban (ELIQUIS) since Friday. He finally went and got it looked at. He is still being treated and will be seeing a hematologist. He stated that DVT symptoms occurred after first dose and was undiagnosed. He treated it as soft tissue injury and thought it was a muscle pull and ankle strain. Eliquis was started on 23Apr2021 and dose is 5 mg. He is taking two tablets twice daily for 7 days and then 1, 5mg tablet bid (twice a day) as well. No emergency room or physician&#39;s office required but Urgent care facility was visited on 23Apr2021. During this visit, they did Lab work, D Dimer results 1590 on 23Apr2021; Venous Doppler resulted in positive DVT in Left Lower Extremity. Chest CT resulted in positive peripheral defects in small branches of the lower lobes bilaterally, left greater than right, consistent with Pulmonary Emboli. Left sided pleural effusion and left basillary infiltrate, possibly atelectasis or developing infarct. Few pleural based nodular densities at right lung base, again atelectasis versus developing infarcts. The rest just states what was normal. Eliquis was prescribed on 23Apr2021, 5 mg two tablets twice daily for 7 days, then regular dose times 7 days. He is to report to hematologist on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the events deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was unknown. The reporter assessed the events as serious (life-threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events DVT of legs and Pulmonary embolism cannot be totally excluded.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I then went to hospital where I was admitted to observation in the ED for monitoring.

This 50-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 in the morning at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included borderline hypertension. There were no concomitant medications. Patient probably took some medication in the past but nothing now. The patient took the vaccine in the morning on 30Dec2020, after took the vaccine he sit in the room for monitoring for 15 minutes, after 1 or 2 minutes patient felt like heart was little bit racing, he didn&#39;t have any other problems like no shortness of breath, no difficulty breathing, no rash or anything like that and he took some bottled water and started drinking, few minutes later, it may have lasted for 5 minutes, it subsided. No emergency room or physician office visited. The patient&#39;s question was whether he could take second shot or not which is probably given in 3 weeks.

I was not given any  medical treatment, and was placed on a monitor for one hour.  Once my hr and 02 stas were at my baseline, I was allowed to be discharged. I went back to my department and  decided to go home, as I felt tired and was mildly nauseous.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

                                                Patient received dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine at a clinic. After the dose was administered the patient experienced tachycardia (pulse 110), elevated BP (measured with arm cuff at ~180/120), headache, and warmth. The patient was offered a cold pack, given water, and was taken away to a secluded room to relax under supervision. After about 1.5 hours the patient improved (BP 120/76 and pulse 85). The patient informed me that his rheumatologist recently had him stop his treatments for Crohn&#39;s disease in preparation to receive the vaccine. He stated that he had similar symptoms before when trying different treatment regimens for his underlying condition. The patient left on his own and no further adverse effects were reported.

                                                Every since getting my vaccine I have been having these symptoms.  I received my first dose of phizer on 1/22/21 and a second dose 21 days later but was given Moderna not phizer.  I continue to have headaches on and off all day, they are short but intense lasting about 5-10 minutes, sometimes hour or two between.  Also shortness of breath and increased heart rate with just slight activity.  Going up a flight of stairs my heart rate will quickly increase to 130-140  BPM which has never happened before.  I have a fitness tracker on my watch so I watch it closely every day and it was never that high.  My heart rate will recover fairly quick if I sit and it will come down to 80-90 BPM, at night when relaxed for a while the lowest I see it is about 70-75 BPM, sleeping it will be around 65 bpm.

A 50-years-old male consumer received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE lot EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, on 03Mar2021 at 3:15 pm (at the age of 50-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, in left arm. Relevant medical history included cholesterol. Concomitant medications included: Rosuvastatin 20mg, once a day for cholesterol, started a year ago and Vitamin C. On 03Mar2021, the patient had heart palpitations that lasted multiple days. I went to a cardiologist and he wasn&#39;t sure whether I should do a second vaccine dose, given that was one of the side effect. He gave me metoprolol which took down the heart rate. But I had the chills, I had part of the face started to clench a little. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s part of Bell&#39;s palsy or that was just, I just don&#39;t know. It wasn&#39;t strong, it went away relatively quickly, within 4 hours. Treatment for heart palpitation: Metoprolol Tartrate, 25 mg, one. No treatment received for chills. The clinical outcome of the events Heart palpitations and chills was recovered on 11Mar2021, the outcome of the event face started to clench a little was recovered on 03Mar2021.

                                                Presented to ED today with complaint of right-sided CP onset yesterday. Patient has history of renal cell carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver.  He has had recurrent pleural effusions involving the right lung.  Has worsened pain with breathing. Had a R tube placed due to pleural effusion and last week when the tape was taken off it pulled and caused pain. Endorses SOB. No significant cardiac history. No h/o DVT, PE. Has renal CA and had L kidney removed. Patient admitted. Pulmonary/critical care was consulted regarding Pleurx catheter.  It is felt that his pleural effusion had decreased in size, and the catheter was likely contributing to his right-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Catheter is removed with good results of his pain.  Patient however did have recurrent fevers.  Empirically placed on Rocephin.  With this, he did improve. He was discharged in stable condition.

I couldn&#39;t keep food down until then. From Day 8 until yesterday (Day 11), I have been having intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, which is my only serious concern.  I have had a declining number of heart palpitations today, Day 12, but felt I should report these heart palpitations in case this is a sign of a serious complication. Should I avoid receiving the second dose?

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

He was found to have 2 small left temporal hemmorhagic contusions on CT scan. He had a seizure during the hospitalization. He was initially treated for HSV encephalitis but it is not clear if that was confirmed. The hospital team may not have known of the recent vaccination. He improved during the hospitalization, but remained with a very unsteady gait. He could not return to the group home. He was transferred to a rehab facility to receive PT on 02/16/2021. He remains at rehab. Prior to the fall, on the 3rd day after vaccination, on 2/8/21 at about 10 am, the patient coughed and had a small blood on the inside of his face mask while at his day program.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

I had a sharp pains in my chest that would come and go. That lasted for three to four days. Then they just went away. I just kept taking my meds. It wasn&#39;t clear if it was a muscle pain or inside my chest - it wasn&#39;t bad enough to hinder me or for me to see a doctor.

I hit my head on a chair when I was falling and cut my head. I stayed laying down because I was still dizzy and hot. They called the squad and did vitals and I was fine. I sat there for about another half an hour and I went home. I have felt fine ever since. Only thing that hurt was my head from the fall.

                                                Patient spoke to me this morning regarding some symptoms he had after his Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination yesterday.  He said he had some pain at the injection site and mild headache in the afternoon; however, around 12 to 1 am in the morning, he was feeling heart palpitation and he felt his muscle twitching from his upper torso which went down to his thigh and no loss of consciousness.  He said he checked his heart rate and it was 70 and he did not have any problems breathing.  He said his heart palpitation felt better after taking some deep breaths.  He said he no longer had heart palpitations or muscle twitching any more.  He denied any other symptoms.   Generally, he appeared well, no facial drooping, awake, alert, oriented, speech clear, and normal gait. (Today)

A 52-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ELO140) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 11Jan2021 at 9:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The relevant medical history included Covid-19 from 17Jul2020 to 14Aug2020, he didn&#39;t get hospitalized but was pretty sick. He had circulation issues with it. He had numbing and tingling in his left three fingers (clarified left three fingers as his middle finger, index finger, and ring finger) and numbing and tingling in his toes as well. Concomitant medications included ubidecarenone (COQ-10), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), rosuvastatin and monascus purpureus (RED YEAST RICE). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 52 years old on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. With second dose the patient thought he would be better, but about 12 hours later he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm. He checked his body temperature and he didn&#39;t have a temp. His temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit. He tried to keep himself warm. He got nauseous with it. Basically he looked on line and was having them. Today he started to feel better, but still a little nauseous. He had severe fatigue. He didn&#39;t realize he could go fill out something on the website for CDC. He knew he had wanted the vaccine because he had some severe symptoms when he had COVID. He didn&#39;t want to get COVID again. His hospital frustrates him sometimes. They didn&#39;t put the date on there when he was to come back for the second dose. They didn&#39;t tell him to come back on the 13th. He had to figure the dates from the website and emails. He talked it over with his wife. He came in contact with it every night. He was taking care of people that were critical. He worked in the intensive care unit. Even the people he took care of that didn&#39;t have it, ended up with it. He wore a mask. He used hand sanitizer. He didn&#39;t want to get it again. People were shocked when he got it the first time. He did verify that he got the second dose one day sooner, instead of the three day window. He was sick with the first and was expecting to be more sick with this one. He wanted to give himself an extra day before he had to go back to work. He had a couple of emails where they discussed increasing the window to do it a day sooner. He was going to have to go an hour an half a way to get the second dose and he didn&#39;t want to do that. The patient underwent lab test included height was approximately six two, weight was about 194 lbs on an unspecified date, and body temperature showed 96 degrees Fahrenheit in Jan2021. The outcome of the event he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm, temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit was recovering, for the events he got nauseous with it and he had severe fatigue were not recovered.

I did get shot series on 12/22/2020 #1 and 1/10/2021 and was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 12/13/2020.  My internist MD did not feel the vaccine caused the thrombus /Stroke but I wanted to report it as it was associated with the vaccine administration (symptoms of vision loss within 24 hours of the vaccine #2 administration).

History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: None, this was the first dose. No other vaccine administered on the same date. The patient had no events prior vaccination within 4 weeks. In all his life. He had vaccines that received and had no adverse event or side effect whatsoever. He had had the regular flu vaccine early November. The patient experienced feeling anxiousness in the brain, Heaviness in the head, feeling weak in Feb2021, Localized soreness and pain in Jan2021, Goosebumps tingly sensation in head, Blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat is getting higher and higher on 04Feb2021. The patient could not take Benadryl as he cannot tolerate Benadryl. With Zyterc he does not have secondary effects like he does with Benadryl. The first week after getting the vaccine he only had kind of had localized soreness and pain in the area. He later clarified it was in the area where got the injection, vaccine. He just had pain soreness in that area. Other than that he had no side effects at that time. The third week, initially stated as, about 5-7 days ago he started to have a feeling of anxiousness in the brain. He could feel anxiousness and sensation in his brain that he did not feel before. It was like he had the flu kind of thing, but he did not have a temperature. However, the feeling is in his head. It is like heaviness feeling from the flu in his head. He has been having the heaviness in the head feeling for 4-5 days. He later further clarified and initially clarified the localized pain and soreness was noticed the second day, the day after getting the vaccine. This only lasted a few days. He does not remember exactly when this ended. He did not take anything for the localized pain and soreness in the same area as the injection. He confirmed he has recovered completely from this event.

Also, along with that feeling at the same time his blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat was getting higher and higher. His regular blood pressure medications won&#39;t work anymore to bring it down. His blood pressure typically ranges in the 130/85 or less range with all the blood pressure medications he was taking. Once he started having this tingling sensation in his head he had the higher blood pressure and higher heart rate. Now his blood pressure would average being about 170/110 to 180/115.

On Tuesday, yesterday, he went to get blood work done. Blood was drawn but has no results yet. Localized pain and soreness time of onset didn&#39;t remember, stated he may have had a little pain right after getting the vaccine, but it was around 21:00 25Jan2021 he really noticed the soreness and pain. The following morning around 9 AM it woke him from his sleep and he could feel it more compared to the first day. Anxiousness in the brain around 16:00. The patient had no emergency visit.

                                                On 1/27/2021, after having received Dose #2 of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 01/07/21, I experienced severe calf pain while playing soccer. Over the next 2 weeks I experienced vascular claudication in that leg and was eventually diagnosed with arterial thrombus in Left tibioperoneal, anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial  arteries. I do not have any known predisposing conditions for arterial thrombus and no history of thromboembolic disease.

During the night, he got up to use the restroom and felt palpitations and lightheadedness, which persisted during the morning. A colleague at work evaluated the patient&#39;s pulse, noting it to be irregular and fast, so patient went to the ED for evaluation. EKG was performed and patient was found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation. Patient was given fluid boluses, 10mg IV diltiazem, and a diltiazem infusion, during which the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm. After stabilization, he was discharged with new prescriptions for metoprolol tartrate 25mg BID and apixaban 5mg BID, to follow up with cardiology.

The first day:  I took the covid-19 vaccine Pfizer shot on Thursday the 4th of March; there was pain at the injection site just as any other vaccine I have been administered during military service.  After the shot I felt tied, and my left arm did hurt from the shot, I started to feel irritable (angry or even aggressive), my chest became tight and my heart rhyme felt somewhat off causing me to start coughing and sometimes uncontrollable to the point I could not catch my breath I thought about seeking medical attention but did not..  The second day:  Pain in my left arm went away at the injection site, tiredness went away, and the feeling of irritable (angry or even aggressiveness) went away, tightness in my chest and coughing went away. I have been having a chronic pain in my left arm for about a year and after the shot the pain was gone I noticed that on the second day. I did notice my body temperature was up and down showing symptoms of histamine reaction but not out of control.

                                                The evening of the vaccine I had minor  tongue swelling. The next night after eating Tuna I had the tongue swelling again with some Tachycardia and a severe headache with red welts all over my body. I also had tightness in my throat. I went to the Urgent Care where they gave me Antihistamine, Prednisone, something for headache and IV Fluids.  I was discharged after three hours and felt better within a few hours. I took Prednisone for five days.

                                                Blood clots in right leg below knee; he passed out from pain; pain in his right knee; he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all; knee was swollen; couldn&#39;t walk/limping around; his knee more stiff; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 53-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 21Mar2021 at 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing Factor V Leiden heterozygous, allergies to mushrooms from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and a torn meniscus in his right knee and he had surgery 3 to 4 years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Cephalexin and Percocet and experienced allergies. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested post vaccination. On 22Mar2021 at night around 2:30AM, the patient woke up and started walking to the bathroom and he passed out from pain. He had pain in his right knee. He thought he had torn his knee again. He had surgery 3 or 4 years ago for a torn meniscus in his right knee and he thought he had torn his meniscus again. He passed out, his wife found him and he went back to bed. In the morning, his knee was still very very sore, he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all. He took an Advil between 6:30AM and 8:00AM. He hadn&#39;t taken any medications prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. His knee was swollen but the pain was manageable. He couldn&#39;t walk, he was on crutches for about 24 hours then the swelling started coming down and he put a brace on his knee. He could then walk without the crutches but it was still painful. The next day he had pain in the back of his knee. He thought the pain was caused because he had put the brace on and had been using the crutches. Like he had made his knee more stiff from not using it. He was limping around and the pain was bearable. At that point, the pain was maybe a 4 on a scale of 1-10 where his pain had been a 9 on a scale of 1-10. He took another Advil and he realized the pain in the back of his knee wasn&#39;t going away. He went to see his family doctor and his doctor was able to get him in that same day for an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed 2 blood clots behind his right knee. The patient had blood clots in right leg below knee. The week of the report, he got an appointment with a hematologist. The hematologist reviewed his case and the doctor isn&#39;t 100% sure the blood clots were from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine but the doctor isn&#39;t ruling it out either because it happened within 24 hours of receiving his first COVID-19 dose. He hadn&#39;t done anything strenuous before getting the COVID-19 vaccine, nothing that he thinks would have caused the blood clots. He would like to add, what he thinks is relevant, is that he is positive for Factor V. He reports he has one copy and Factor V only impacts about 3% of the population. The hematologist thought that he might be prone to developing blood clots. The hematologist reports that he has had patients who have had the COVID-19 virus who have developed blood clots. Maybe it&#39;s possible that the COVID-19 antibodies were trying to build up his immune system to COVID-19 and it created something similar to having the COVID-19 virus. If he is predisposed to blood clots then the COVID-19 vaccine may have precipitated the blood clots. His second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for Sunday, 11Apr2021. He had talked to both his family doctor and his hematologist and they both thought he should be ok in getting the second COVID-19 vaccine. He was prescribed blood thinners. If the second COVID-19 vaccine caused more blood clots the blood thinners would help him. He was asking if there is any additional information or guidance on receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine after his reaction. The pharmacist told him that the COVID-19 vaccine trials were all done in the left arm. He received his vaccine in his right arm and his right knee was affected. If he gets the second COVID-19 vaccine he&#39;s getting it in his left arm. He was prescribed Eliquis 5mg take one tablet twice daily. The outcome of the event blood clots in right leg below knee was recovering while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 53-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm at 53 years old on 20Mar2021 08:00 (Lot Number: EP7534) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure from 2018, he says he has had this for roughly 3 years. Concomitant medication included amlodipine at 5mg once a day for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date in 2018 and ongoing, he says he has been taking this for a few years, maybe 3 years. No additional vaccines were administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect or within 4 weeks. He was not sick at the time of vaccination previously. The patient was calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He says he is just trying to get answers because what he experienced was very alarming to him. He got the vaccine at 8:00 in the morning. He says a student did it, she took a long time, she was very timid. He says she was being supervised by an RN. He experienced shortness of breath on 07Apr2021, he says it was in the morning that the shortness of breath started, because he did make an appointment to go the the COVID test, he got the COVID test around noon that same day. He says he was diagnosed with pericardial effusion requiring drainage and inflammation of the heart sac. He says he had fluid overload on the lungs that required IV diuretics. He says the symptoms started after the vaccine, and these symptoms were what was causing the shortness of breath. He says the fluid around the heart made the heart beat super fast to pump up blood. He says the fluid triggered the shortness of breath. He says when they removed fluid the breathing got easier but then it settled into the lungs. He says Tuesday he dropped off the cliff, Tuesday or Wednesday night, one of them, for two nights he was on oxygen, they gave him a diuretic for the lungs, after 12 hours he started feeling better, continued to get better and better after they moved the fluid from the lungs with Lasix through the IV. He says he doesn&#39;t fit the profile of someone who would develop these issues, he has no history, no cancer, no autoimmune disorders. He says they say well maybe it is the virus but the doctors currently have no specific answers for the caller. He says they told him that someone having this would be the profile of an IV drug user. He says he never uses drugs, he does not fit a profile like this. He says he wants to be fully vaccinated. He says the timing is suspicious with the vaccine shot. He says it is 50/50 on the doctor&#39;s opinions, half say to get the shot, the other half say don&#39;t do it. He says they say the second shot is worse. He says he is confused as to what to do, that he understands this is a big experiment, he wants the vaccine but not at the cost of another visit to the hospital. He says he was at the hospital on oxygen, he couldn&#39;t get out of bed for a day. He says the doctor said there was a study in (Withheld), the caller says he did a lot of research in the hospital for 6 days, that says the demographic is younger but it is heart issues with men for the heart with the Pfizer vaccine. He says they are studying it. He says a couple of doctors referred to that, the ones that say don&#39;t get the shot, not yet. He says he can&#39;t pinpoint it exactly. He says it could have been a fluke but the timing is very suspicious. He says that because of some of the side effects, his week in hospital, he was concerned for his life, he wants to be fully vaccinated but not at the cost of going though this or cost of killing him. He says he does not want to go through this again, he will not get vaccinated unless he is comfortable. He asks should he switch to (Withheld), is that a safer bet, (Withheld), should he just skip it all together or not. He says he knows they are a different type of vaccine. He says they had to remove fluid form his pericardial sac, he had 2 days of draining, they drained a liter from around the heart so it could beat normal again. He says apparently some of the fluid went to the lungs so he needed oxygen. He says this all happened Tuesday morning, he came back home yesterday, he looks pretty good. He says he just wants to do the vaccine and asks should he take the second one or not. He would like to get any information. He says the fluid in his heart was starting to build up on 05Apr2021 or 06Apr2021, he started getting symptoms that come and go. He says he was admitted to the hospital on 19Apr2021 and his procedure was on 20Apr2021 so his shortness of breath resolved the day after the procedure. He says he was hospitalized from 19Apr2021 to 25Apr2021. After reporting shortness of breath he says that was it, basically. He says he went to the nurse treatment center on 19Apr2021 because he thought it might be COVID but this event landed him in the hospital. The events required a visit to emergency room, he said he went to the emergency room on 19Apr2021 and a doctor told him he might not make it. The patient said he was scared and he didn&#39;t know why the doctor would have said that to him. He said he did not have an appointment date to physician office yet, he was waiting to get a call back. Relevant Tests included: Rapid COVID test, Date 07Apr2021 Result negative, Date 15Apr2021 Result negative, Date 19Apr2021 at Patient First Result negative, Date 19Apr2021 at the hospital on admittance, Result negative. Standard COVID test, Date 19Apr2021 Result negative, Date 15Apr2021 Result negative. He says at the hospital there was a lot of tests done on his heart and lungs, nothing was coming back scary, they were coming back as perhaps viral markers. The outcome of shortness of breath was recovered on 21Apr2021, of other events was unknown.

A 53-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 53-year-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Apr2021 11:15 (Lot Number: EW0153) at 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. The patient received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included famotidine (PEPCID AC).  The patient previously took flu shot in Oct2020, prilosec [omeprazole magnesium] for seasonal allergy and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced unexpected bruising near injection site. Bruise was the size of the bandaid, approximately 1&#34; x 2&#34;. Bruising had persisted for more than a week now. The patient had never experienced bruising like this with other vaccines. He would like to rule out possible thrombosis reaction before second shot. He did not have bruising at any other locations other than the injection site.  Bruise was purple and red splotches and has now progressed to mostly yellow. He believed the discoloration was a reaction to the vaccine and not the result of the needle. The shot itself was painful but patient felt minimal pain/stiffness following the shot. The event start date was on 20Apr2021. No treatment was received. The outcome was unknown.

Patient also had mild fever for the last two days and was on Tylenol, blood pressure also remained elevated moderately than the usual readings. Patient was admitted through ER for 2 days and was discharged on 1/24/21, with a diagnosis of possible TIA, Todd&#39;s paresis post seizure. Patient&#39;s CT head and MRI of brain was negative for acute stroke. Patient&#39;s left facial droop and right side facial puffiness resolved over a week but noticed to have right sided pronounced weakness with moderate swelling on right arm. Patient used to eat by himself,but now not able to do so and not able to hold cup in the right hand. Patient was again sent to ER for repeat CAT scan of head, further evaluation and management. Not sure if patient had an adverse reaction to Covid-19 vaccination, but definitely these symptoms were developed after 2 weeks of receiving Pfizer vaccination, which may be coincidental. Patient was followed up by the neurologist a week after the discharge from hospital who couldn&#39;t rule out adverse reaction of vaccination. Patient is awaiting for an EEG, carotid ultrasound and Echo as an out patient.

I did not have trouble breathing or swallowing. Very similar to what has happened to me sometimes getting blood drawn but happens at time of appointment not after.  Reclined, deep breaths and started to feel better within 10 minutes.  An hour later feeling much better.

                                                Within approximately a couple of days from the first of two COVID19 Pfizer injections, I developed a progressive, systemic, neuro/neuro-muscular inflammatory pain response.  The inflammation and pain first manifested in my left wrist and hand, greatly worsening recent symptomology that may have been the start of a carpal tunnel syndrome.  The inflammation and pain then progressed to my right wrist and hand and right shoulder.  Then they progressed to my left shoulder, under my clavicles, my hips,  and my upper lumbar/lower thoracic region of my spine.  Muscle groups tightened and hurt, chief among them my hamstrings and upper back.  All within days.  The inflammation and pain were severe, especially from the early a.m. (3 or 4 in the a.m.) to waking hours.  And the conditions left me nearly debilitated and incapable of sleeping well or performing many ADLs.  Then, on Monday, March 29, 2021, I saw an orthopaedic for the pains in my wrists and hands, and he prescribed me a steroid for a preliminary diagnose of bilateral carpal tunnel.  The inflammation and pain throughout my body decreased considerably after only two doses of the steroids.  That led me to seek a consultation with the rheumatologist.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                had pulmonary embolism in both lungs; blood clots/blood clots in the lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm right on 07Apr2021 at vaccination age of 54 years old (Lot Number: EN6208; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There was no medical history.  No known allergies.  No Covid prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left on 08Mar2021 14:00 at vaccination age of 54 years old (Lot Number: EN6205; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. No other vaccine in four weeks. No other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced had pulmonary embolism in both lungs on 17Apr2021 13:00, blood clots/blood clots in the lungs on 17Apr2021 13:00.  Events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. The patient had pulmonary embolism in both lungs. He was in the hospital for 3 days and now he will have to take blood thinners in definitely. He was admitted 17Apr2021 and discharged home 19Apr2021. He did not have history of blood clots and zero risk factors. Two doctors blamed the vaccine. He did not want to take blood thinners forever. He needed help figuring out how to determine if this was related to the vaccine. He had a reaction to the second shot and he had been in the hospital the last 3 days and the 2 different doctors that saw him said the only thing that was different was that he had received the COVID vaccine. He had blood clots in both of his lungs, he was in serious condition for a couple days there but his biggest concern now was that they were telling him that he will have to take medication forever to thin his blood because they didn&#39;t think there was a genetic reason it happened and that was the protocol that healthcare providers have to follow. They were telling him that he might contact a hematologist and do a blood study but they said they were certain that it came from the vaccine because there was no history of this in his family or himself. He said the condition&#39;s medical term was pulmonary embolism but he just said blood clots in the lungs because he thought he would make it easier to explain. Both doctors that saw him felt it was brought on the by the vaccine. He was not looking to sue or anything, he didn&#39;t want to be taking a blood thinner for the rest of life. He was not doing this for any reason other than to get well. He realized this situation was very rare with Pfizer, it was like 4 in 1 million with Pfizer according to his physicians. Covid tested post vaccination: Nasal Swab on 17Apr2021 with negative result. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of had pulmonary embolism in both lungs, blood clots/blood clots in the lungs. The outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

                                                The following are descriptions is a synopsis of information provided over the phone by the patient&#39;s wife on 5/10: At time of second dose patient was fatigued, lethargic, hyperglycemic, and experiencing brain fog. She states some of the symptoms started some time after his first dose but couldn&#39;t provide a time frame. On 5/6 he answered the Vaccine Questionnaire question of &#34;are you sick today?&#34; as &#34;unsure&#34; and further discussion was had with a pharmacist to verify he was eligible to receive vaccine. Neither the pharmacist or patient remember the details of this discussion.  Patient and wife have belief that his ethnicity contributed to dismissing of possible illness during the vaccine screening process, but due to the patient&#39;s lethargy and brain fog at the time, he could not provide specifics of the conversation. His wife was not with him during the screening process with the pharmacist or during vaccine administration. The appointment time was 4:55pm. The wife states the patient was so fatigued after the shot was administered on 5/6 that he was asleep in his chair in the observation area.  Later that day fever of 100.5 was noted and controlled by OTC ibuprofen 2 hours after the ibuprofen was administered. The wife states that he rapidly declined over the 3 days after second Pfizer vaccine and she called an ambulance on Sunday 5/9. From the ER he was admitted to the ICU with the primary reason for admission listed as hyperglycemia but a COVID was listed as a contributing factor. The COVID test administered Sunday was positive. He had high blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, and sodium. Patients vitals have since stabilized other than the sodium is still high. He is in ICU at hospital still very lethargic as of today 5/10.

No excessive cough or fever, did have dyspnea with any exertion and this continues but seems to be lessening. Was not able to work due to fatigue. Yesterday remained tired but felt noticeably different-felt lighter-and today seems promising.

                                                Diffuse abdominal pain onset approximately 10-12 hr post dose.  I was initially awoken that first night with nausea and abdominal pain. This continued through 1/22/21. My nausea had subsided and I was able to eat in small quantities. My abdomen felt bloat with mild distention. The AM of 1/23/21, I awoke and the diffuse abdominal pain had abated. I was left with RLQ abdominal pinpoint pain. This became progressively worse throughout the day. I presented to the ER on 1/23/21. Chem panel was normal. CBC also normal.   I received an abdominal CT scan with IV contrast for R/O appy. My appendix was normal. The scan revealed a serosal venous thrombophlebitis wth inflammation in the mesentery and transverse colitis.  The pain continued to progress, so I presented to the ER again on 1/25/21.  I received another abdominal CT along with additional lab work.  Lactate normal. D-Dimer mildly elevated at 0.7 and CRP was 9.7. Again CBC was normal. This CT did not reveal the micro-emboli or colits but rather omental inflammation.  At this point, surgery was consulted along with hematology for opinion regarding anticoagulation. The decision to anti coagulate was deferred. The diagnosis I received was omental infarct.  I remain on pain medications and continue to monitor for changes in my pain and a fever.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.  RADIOLOGY DIAGNOSTIC - CHEST PORTABLE 02/04 2051 *** Report Impression - Status: SIGNED  Entered: 02/04/2021 2059 IMPRESSION: 1. Findings highly suspicious for portal venous gas which can be seen in the setting of bowel ischemia.  Consider CT for further evaluation and/or surgical consultation. 2.

Ill-defined patchy opacities within the bilateral upper lobes, right middle lobe, in consolidative opacities within bilateral lower lobes which could represent aspiration, and/or multifocal pneumonia. 2. Small right trace left pleural effusions. 3. Diffusely dilated small bowel without a transition point and mucosal hyperenhancement involving the colon with areas of pneumatosis involving loops of small bowel within the left upper quadrant and portal venous air consistent with hypoperfusion complex. There is a small caliber appearance of the aorta and a flattened appearance of the IVC is well. 4. Intravascular air within the IVC and bilateral iliac veins could be secondary to right femoral central lying injection. 5. Somewhat abnormal enhancement pattern of the kidneys with hypoenhancement of the medullary pyramids which may suggest hypoperfusion injury as well. 6.

A 55-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248) first dose on 12Feb2021 on Deltoid Left at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Covid-19 and High cholesterol. Concomitant medications were not reported. He said that he was 60 days post COVID and his doctor advised him to get vaccinated. He was feeling fine, but after 10 minutes into the shot, he had a metallic taste in the mouth. After 12-13 minutes, he had a feeling of impending death and thought he was gonna die. It freaked him out. He was rushed to the ER and had a complete blood count (CBC) and Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) test run on him. It was that his Potassium level went down to 3.3 and his platelets dropped to 141. He had tests on 28Jan2021 and mentioned that his Potassium levels were normal and had a platelet count of 181. He mentioned that there was no other way but the vaccine that could have caused this. He is if he would already have passed away from the shot from his opinion. Patient had a Syncopal episode of some type. He had an intended feeling like he was going to die after the shot, he was 60 days post Covid when he get that shot, he was getting over Covid and he was 60 days and he didn&#39;t wait the 90 days his primary doctor care told me that he can get it too because he was feeling better which he was feeling better but since then he have gotten that shot, he went to the doctor on the 28Jan2021 and he had CBC drawn on him and he went for his regular physical and Covid follow-up at his doctor, his platelets counts drop since he have had shot struck at 40 points, feels concerning. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported &#34;feeling of impending death and Syncopal episode &#34; and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient received first dose of Pfizer vaccine 3/24/21. Patient became unsteady and was directed to stretcher. Patient has a hx of HTN and reports not taking his BP medication for &#34;a while.&#34; Patient was unsure what BP medication he was on. Reports potentially taking Lasix and Vit K. Patient reports not eating or drinking prior to receiving the vaccination. Alert and oriented. Denies SOB/chest pain.     Vitals taken at 10:45AM:  BP 197/11  HR 75 SPO2 98% RA   ED rapid response called. Pt unable to stand up from stretcher.   Patient was taken to ED and neurology was consulted.  Neurology noted:  55-year-old man past medical history of hypertension coming with uncontrolled hypertension systolic over 220.  Concern for gait instability, no evidence of strength weakness on any extremity with confrontational testing.  No evidence of change in altered mental status, no evidence of cranial nerve palsy, and no evidence of sensory loss.   No evidence of coordination problems with finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing bilaterally.  He exhibits 5 out of 5 confrontational testing to all extremities muscles as above albeit with giveaway weakness.  NIHSS 0.     Although patient presents within TPA window he has had no disabling symptoms and therefore is not a candidate for TPA.  Although the patient presents with a mechanical thrombectomy window he has no disabling symptoms and no evidence of LVO either on exam or my preliminary read of his CTA head and neck.  As such he is not a candidate for mechanical thrombectomy.   Symptoms do not localize well although patient presents with clear hypertensive urgency versus hypertensive emergency.  Would recommend full medical work-up for this condition as we rule out signs of acute ischemic stroke.   Patient passes dysphagia screen in the ED.  Recommendation: 1. Admit to Observation.  2. MRI brain without contrast 3. Obtain stroke labs A1c, TSH, lipid profile 4. PT OT consult evaluation and treat 5. Social worker and case management consult for stroke work-up

                                                Within 5-minutes of vaccination, the patient reported weakness and confusion. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. No signs of stroke. EKG demonstrated NSR, rate 77bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG was 290mg/dl. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. Enroute, the patient became increasingly confused, forgetting their birthday and location. Patient was hypertensive (178/104) and reported a &#34;crushing headache&#34;. EMS crew became concerned for stroke. In ED, the patient remained hypertensive (178/93). ED Physician had high suspicion of TIA versus acute reaction to COVID-19 vaccine. Administerd 650mg acetaminophen and 1mg Lorazepam. Admitted patient to critical care unit where patient stated they had developed a sudden-onset diffuse banding-like headache with associated nausea, diaphoresis, blurry vision, and confusion. MRI was negative and patient was transferred from ICU to hospital. Hospital physician believed the symptoms were likely a vagal mediated response or reaction to his COVID vaccination. Patient was discharged on 3/20 with diagnoses of TIA, Acute encephalopathy, Insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, Essential hypertension, CAD, Unspecified mood disorder, Dyslipidemia, Obesity, and Mild neuro cognitive disorder

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base. He had pain in the base of his right foot. Blood tests were in the second week. Glucose was high and he is hypoglycemic.

They tested him, they evaluated him but they ruled out anything that has to do with the heart. They checked his heart, he had a cardiac catheterization, and was ruled out, everything came out negative.  So, he just got out of hospital and was still developing the pain and it&#39;s on his left side, it&#39;s on his right side (as reported). He called all his doctors, they had no answers for him, now he was still in a lot of pain in both of shoulders like he was saying his left side was still the worst, and it has not gone away and the pain is still shooting down around his heart and shooting down around the back of neck and now it&#39;s going on the top of his legs.  He went to the bone doctor and he was getting an MRI done, because the doctors said nothing was torn in his arms or tissues. He stated the pain was around his arms, back and wraps down to the heart. He was in dire pain, 8.5/10 and had a feeling of it was related to the vaccine. He clarified the pain was in both shoulders and the left side was worse and that was the side he had his shot on.

The strong one that he experienced 12-14 hours after receiving the first dose did not show. Arm soreness was much less than after the first dose. Fatigue was comparable, and in third day still had to take a nap immediately after the breakfast. Additional nap was taken during the day-needed more but did not have time. The patient felt some chills in the back of the head some days but did not get &#34;sick&#34; at all. All events occurred on 26Jan2021 13:00. No treatment received for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines in four weeks. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was resolved in Jan2021.

                                                I was symptom free when I went to bed four hours after vaccination.  In the middle of that first night (03/02/21), I awoke with an overall body ache, which persisted through the next day.  In the morning of the next day (03/03/21), I awoke with soreness at the vaccination site, tightness in my chest, and a swollen, red left ankle.  The overall achiness and sore arm were understandable, but the chest tightness made we wonder if inflammation in the region persisted from my cardiac ablation in May 2020 and was aggravated by the covid vaccine.  I have a Kardia home-test ECG monitor, and the results of the test continue to be &#34;normal.&#34;  As far as the ankle, an MRI in August 2020 determined that I had torn my peroneal brevis tendon.  After six weeks in a walking boot, I began physical therapy and noticed that if I exerted myself too much that I would get swelling and soreness.  Everything in my ankle was healed by October 2020, and I have been hiking / running four times a week since without incident.  I did not injure myself before the vaccination, so it seems to much of a coincidence that inflammation returned to my previously injured ankle just hours after receiving the covid vaccine.

Two days later I started having diffuse sporadic and intermittent tingling on various parts of my body.  That lasted about 2 days in its greatest severity.  On day 6 post vaccine, I was walking in an airport and developed chest pain, tachycardia, and shortness of breath out of proportion to my level of exertion.  This chest pain, shortness of breath and tachycardia with minimal exertion (a flight of stairs.  A walk to the end of driveway.) has persisted since then.  A cardiac w/u with Echo and  treadmill stress ECHO were negative.  I also have intermittent fatigue, headaches, and a mild &#34;brain fog.&#34;

I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

                                                I had my first shot of Pfizer vaccine last Friday morning (March 5). In the evening, I felt fatigued. So I went to sleep early. When I got up Saturday morning, I felt dizzy. The dizziness went away in a few minutes. In the next 36 hours, I had the angina feelings - tightness in the left chest and I felt heart be squeezed occasionally. When I stand up and walk, I felt better. Finally Sunday evening (March 7), I took a walk outside and felt symptom free. Maybe the walk helped, maybe the &#34;thrombosis&#34; had run its course before my walk.   I have not had the severe angina symptoms since my PCI procedure in Feb 2018. I am sure the recent occurrence is related to the vaccine.   Besides reporting the adverse event, I want to get advices whether I should receive the second shot.   Thank you!

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) on 14Jan2021 (at the age of 57 years; as reported) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) on 28Dec2020 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had a stroke on 01Feb2021 at 15:00. The event resulted to  emergency room/department visit and physician office visit but was not given any treatment (as reported). The patient was hospitalized for stroke for 27 days. The event was considered serious, life threatening, and disabling/incapacitating. Patient&#39;s nasal swab test on an unspecified date was negative. The outcome of stroke was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on know n drug profile  it is unlikely that the reported cerebrovascular accident was causally  related to  BNT162B2.  This is probably an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product and on the conduct of the study are evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

A 57-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 57-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included joint pain and ongoing 45-packs per year smoker. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), hydroxyzine (manufacturer unknown) and diclofenac sodium (manufacturer unknown). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The physician reported, &#34;patient had anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema on separate hospitalization (I was not involved for this but reviewed photos and this was reportedly attributed to the vaccine; I&#39;m uncertain if that event was reported). On hospitalization, the patient was with small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism on a CT PE (CT scan for Pulmonary Embolus). Patient is an active smoker. No other obvious cause.&#34; As a result of the adverse events (unspecified), the patient was hospitalized for one day. The start date of the events was on 29Mar2021. The patient was treated with apixaban (for pulmonary embolism). The clinical outcome of &#34;anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema&#34; and &#34;small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism&#34; was resolving.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for events pulmonary embolism, anaphylactic reaction and associated generalized rash and generalized erythema. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I received the *Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine EUA*. I was already not feeling my best that morning symptoms of warmness at home no fever , I checked. No issues with vaccine given approximately 0715, until 1005 am after a very busy morning with nothing but coffee to drink. As I sat down to assist in order entry in our chemo clinic I suddenly became aware of a very rapid heart rate. I realized that I was having a vaso-vagal response and started perspiring lightly and realizing I was having drop in blood pressure. I composed myself removed my mask and breathed slowly and drank cold water while sitting. After a few minutes I was able to slow my heart rate and felt secure enough to leave the pharmacy. I slowly walked and controlled my breathing and continued to drink water. I was able to return to work and continued until the end of the day. I felt somewhat fatigued until bedtime that evening. Slept reasonably well that night and had no other symptoms to my memory the following day.

                                                Heart rate increased; Swelling arm; Arm soreness; soreness at the vaccine injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 13:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) at an unspecified dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was reported as &#34;no pre-existing conditions.&#34; He mentioned that he reviewed his allergies with a pharmacist prior to vaccination but did not specify what his allergies were. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was a tobacco user from an unknown date. The patient also reported a history of pneumonia which was reported to have occurred on seven different occasions following each of seven different vaccinations with the flu vaccine (manufacturers unknown) prior to 2013. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. He stated that after receiving the COVID 19 Vaccine he had side effects. He said the side effects went away at twenty four hours later, but he is still having one side effect, and has a concern. He clarified that he has an elevated heart rate since getting the COVID 19 Vaccine. He said he has never had an elevated heart rate before getting the COVID 19 Vaccine. He reported his heart rate is normally low, between 62-65. He said when he was at work on 28Dec2020 his heart rate was OK, but prior to going to bed that night his heart rate was 93 - 95. He said he thought at first he was just stressed. He also reported the COVID 19 Vaccine is the only thing he has taken. He mentioned that his heart rate has been down to 93, but then up to 105, and higher. He specified that he first presented with an elevated heart rate between 4:00 5:00PM on Tuesday, 29Dec2020. He said the elevated heart rate subsided enough for him to sleep later that day. He said he then started work around 10:00AM today, 30Dec2020, and felt the elevated heart rate in himself, and didn&#39;t say anything to anyone at work. He said when his heart rate got bad, it was about 12:30PM today and that today (30Dec2020) at work he didn&#39;t feel right at lunch, so he took his oxygen level and heart rate. He said his heart rate was 141. He said he called his primary care doctor, but didn&#39;t go to the emergency room. He said he doesn&#39;t have chest pain. He said he said something about his heart rate to a staff member at work, and the staff member tested his heart rate, and told him it was 141. He said he spoke to the nurse at his doctor&#39;s office, and the nurse said the doctor couldn&#39;t do much, and that he could go to emergency room or their practice&#39;s urgent care that is open until 7:00PM.  He said he tried to go to the hospital emergency room, but ended up driving by because the hospital was so busy they were triaging patient&#39;s in the parking lot. The patient also experienced arm swelling and arm soreness following the vaccination on 28Dec2020. He said he could feel the soreness at the vaccine injection site when he moved his left arm. He stated that the swelling was down to his biceps and it resolved within 12- to 14 hours after the vaccination. As treatment, the patient took a generic 81 mg Baby Aspirin (UPC Number: 050428323922, Lot Number: P110657 Expiration Date: May2020) on 30Dec2020 between 3:00 and 3:30. The patient stated that the generic 81mg baby aspirin was an expired product. The clinical outcome of heart rate increased was not recovered and the clinical outcome of arm swelling, arm soreness and vaccination site soreness was recovered on 28Dec2020.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He was acutely distressed. He was treated with IV benadryl and IM epinephrine. The difficulty swallowing resolved, but chest tightness persisted. Trial of nitroglycerin did not improve his pain so pt was given IV hydromorphone. After approximately 10 minutes he was  relaxed and breathing comfortably, but still endorsing chest pain.

Pt returned to work 03/01/2021 then checked into urgent care the following day d/t worsening symptoms. Patient Plan written by PAC: &#34;At this time the nature of your pain is not clear. Your cardiac enzymes are within normal limits except for myoglobin which often goes up with skeletal muscle pain. Your BNP test which can come up with congestive heart failure is elevated slightly from your normal.  We will want to recheck this in a week or so. Differential diagnoses could be skeletal muscle pain/injury, herpes zoster or shingles. (This can sometimes have sharp nerve type pain that will develop into a rash within the first 7 days.) Your rapid COVID test was negative.  We are sending a PCR test out just to confirm.  While awaiting test results please isolate at home. We will call you soon as results are back. Refer to Mendocino County&#39;s packet/isolation order. Your potassium level is low at 3.2.  It should be 3.6. We gave you some potassium to take in the clinic.  I am going to give you some to take for an additional few days. When you follow-up next week plan to have your labs redrawn.&#34; Plan Orders: SARS-CoV-2 RNA (COVID-19), QUALITATIVE NAAT to be performed. URIC ACID to be performed. The patient had the following medication order(s) completed today: Potassium Chloride 40meq PO; Toradol 15mg IVP.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

                                                Dizziness, shortness of breath, cold sweats, fatigue, unsteady on feet, feeling of heart racing, severe vomiting, total exhaustion.  These symptoms were severe, much worse than when I had the virus in December. I thought I was having a stroke and was minutes away from dialing 911.

It was a level of disorientation I have never experienced before in my lifetime.  I fainted one time and was having extreme difficulty getting my bearings and walking and was simply in total &#34;mental disarray&#34;.  I was having difficulty producing words, a prolonged stutter, you might say.  I was shaking.  The local paramedics came and I was taken to the local ER.  Because I was having difficulty speaking, the paramedics (and later the physicians) thought I might have had a TIA.  An MRI on 04/07/2021 at 5pm produced a negative result.  So i can only attribute my reaction to the vaccine.  It was very significant, and i thought it made sense to report it.

I had not been able to keep down food in 10 days and for 3 days could not keep down liquids, so I went to the E/R. Pulse was down to 37bpm.  Blood had a high clotting factor as was starting to clot. Every nerve in my body felt like it was being electrified while on Fire at the same time!  Acute pain in my heart - Thought I was having a heart attack. High fever with chills and sweats.  Extreme dehydration.  And my kidneys hurt like hell.  They are taxed working overtime.   I was in such extreme pain, they had to shoot me up with Morphine every 4 hours to get it under control. They had to administer blood thinners to prevent clots.  I&#39;m still on blood thinners thanks to this damn vaccine! I was so dehydrated, they gave me 5 bags of IV Saline, a picture of Ice,  a picture of Water, then a picture of Tea, before I could even urinate.    I got to the E/R just in time before my heart stopped,  or before a clot formed and killed me.  Was in the hospital for 2 days.    I&#39;m home now, but still in pain.  I can&#39;t eat but force myself to drink liquids.  I do know if I will be getting any more vaccines...

                                                Full blown seizure; Fatigue; Confusion; Breathing was off; breath was heavier; patient&#39;s blood pressure was very low; Real sluggish/get slow; Speech started to get slow; This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 58-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8734) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:00 at age of 58-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It also stated the patient was one of the most vulnerable against virus so he took the Covid-19 Vaccine. Medical history included ongoing cardiac failure congestive diagnosed probably 10 years ago, ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed probably 20 years ago, ongoing dialysis for 3.5 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing unspecified blood thinner. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t take any blood pressure medications and that she knew the patient took a blood thinner. Caller unable to provide further detail for the patient&#39;s medications as she doesn&#39;t have the patient&#39;s list of medications with her. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EP7534) injected in left arm in Mar2021 at age of 58-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fatigue after the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that it was hard to determine the cause of the fatigue because the patient was on dialysis, but that the patient has been more fatigued since he received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was a compromised fellow with a host of pre-existing conditions as far as heart disease, diabetes, and dialysis. Caller was calling in regard to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she was calling to report a bad reaction that her husband, the patient, received on Sunday, 04Apr2021, following his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Approximately 3 hours after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient had a full blown seizure at 15:00 on Sunday, 04Apr2021. Caller reported that she had to call emergency responders following the patient&#39;s seizure. The patient was doing better but the experience with his seizure was quite traumatic. Caller stated that if it was going to happen, it was going to happen to us. About 3 hours after receiving his Covid-19 vaccine on 04Apr2021, the patient became real sluggish and his speech started getting slow before the seizure occurred. Caller reported that the patient made a gradual descent downwards. Caller reported that she swears the patient has not been the same as far as fatigue goes since the patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior. Caller reported that she thought the fatigue was maybe from dialysis. The patient started to get slow just before the seizure, about 2.5 hours after he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was laying down following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s breathing was off. The patient&#39;s breath was heavier. Caller reported that after she noticed the patient&#39;s breathing was off, she asked the patient if he was ok. Caller reported that this is when she noticed that the patient&#39;s speech was really slow and that he was experiencing confusion. The patient has had no more seizure activity. The patient was still being monitored in the hospital. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t remember any of it. It&#39;s hard to say if the patient&#39;s sluggishness and fatigue were ongoing. Caller reported that she couldn&#39;t go see the patient while he was in the hospital but that the patient&#39;s voice sounds much stronger. For Confusion and Speech: Caller reported that the patient seems to be back/ returned to normal. Caller reported that she knew that the patient&#39;s cardiologist went to see the patient. The patient&#39;s cardiologist said that there was nothing that happened to the patient&#39;s heart, that what the patient experienced was not a heart issue, and that the event had no effect on the patient&#39;s heart. The medical staff stated that the seizure the patient experienced was related to a blood pressure drop. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s blood pressure was very low on 04Apr2021. The patient required a visit to Emergency Room for event seizure, no visit of physician office. Admitted on Sunday, 04Apr2021 for seizure, and still hospitalized. For investigations: Caller reported that the medical staff at the hospital definitely did lab work but she was not sure if any imaging was performed. Caller reported that she has no results available for tests that were performed. The outcome of events confusion and &#34;speech started to get slow&#34; was recovered in Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021380129 same patient, different product(dose)/event

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 10Mar2021 at 16:30 (batch/lot number: EN6208) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (wanted the protection). Medical history included deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from Jul2018 and ongoing. No family medical history relevant to the adverse events. Concomitant medication included warfarin taken for maintenance level for history of DVT from Aug2020 and ongoing. The patient experienced DVT in right leg on 02Apr2021, swelling in right leg on 15Mar2021 and discomfort in right leg while walking on 15Mar2021. The patient reported that he had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and he believes that it was directly related to the COVID-19 vaccine. He reported that he has a history of blood clots in his right leg going back to 2018. He reported that his most recent DVT was in Aug2020 and he was cleared in Nov2020. He reported that he received the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Mar2021. He reported that on 15Mar2021, he started to notice his right leg swelling. He reported that he called his physician on 29Mar2021 and that his physician ordered an ultrasound. He reported that he had the ultrasound on 02Apr2021 and a deep vein thrombosis was found again. Swelling in right leg: he reported that the swelling has gone down. He reported that the reason that he mentioned that he has a history of blood clots was because of his warfarin dosage. He reported that he was first diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis in Jul2018. He reported that he went through that cycle and that his maintenance level of warfarin was maybe 10 or 12 mg of warfarin per day. He reported that he had another deep vein thrombosis in Aug2020, and since Aug2020 he has been on 17 mg of warfarin daily. He reported that the blood level on warfarin maintenance was supposed to be between 2 and 2.5. He reported that now because of the deep vein thrombosis he experienced in Aug2020, his doctor wanted his level to be at 2.5 to 3.5. He stated that he doesn&#39;t think that at that blood level for his warfarin that he should have gotten a blood clot. He reported that something compromised or interfered with the warfarin, resulting in a deep vein thrombosis. Discomfort when walking: he reported that it feels like his leg was compressing. He reported that the discomfort seems to have gotten better. He was queried for details of warfarin prescription. He reported that the 10 or 12 mg warfarin tablets that he had been taking when the blood clot was diagnosed in Aug2020 have been consumed and he no longer has the bottle. He reported that he did not have the bottle with him for his current warfarin prescription. He reported that the warfarin was not auto-refilled by the pharmacy. He reported that the warfarin was only prescribed a week or two at a time. Investigations: he reported that since Aug2020 when the deep vein thrombosis returned, he started doing self INR tests at home. He reported that he constantly self-monitors his INR at home and his levels were consistently at 3.0 to 3.1. He reported that he monitors his INR at least once a week, sometimes twice a week depending on how he feels. He reported that sometimes his INR goes over 4 and he can feel it. He reported that his system was a little off when it feels too high so he knows how to adjust. He reported that he last checked his INR today, 15Apr2021, and that it was 4.0. He reported that he typically checks his INR on Wednesday. He reported that he keeps a log of his INR levels. He reported that he did not see his physician on 29Mar2021, but that he called his physician and his physician wrote a prescription for the caller to get an ultrasound. Vaccination facility type was pharmacy. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He reported that he doesn&#39;t usually get vaccines. BNT162B2 second dose (lot number: ER5729) was administered on an unspecified date; anatomical location: left arm. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Approximately 60 seconds prior to emergency, patient felt a sense of panic (first time ever).  Stated to me (wife) &#34;I feel like I am having a panic attack&#34; as we walked on to a parking garage elevator at 12:30 pm on 1.22.21.  As I turned to push the button to go down, leaned against the wall of the elevator. His eyes fluttered and back, he was a little pale.  When I turned around, again, he fainted and fell face down on the elevator floor.  He never stopped breathing and had no convulsions.  He was out for less than 30 seconds. When he came to, he got up by himself with minimal assist from me (911 was already on their way).  He did not remember saying that he felt like he was having a panic attack; but he remember the fear/panic he felt just prior to.  He was oriented x3.  I had him smile, stick his tongue out and speak to make sure it was not a TIA or stroke and there were no symptoms of that.  His bladder did release.  He went by ambulance to the ER (we were on a mini vacation to celebrate his birthday). They did a CAT scan, checked his blood sugar twice, EKG twice, complete blood work panels and urinalysis  All tests were either normal or negative.  They found nothing.  His BP was normal for the first 30 minutes at the hospital, then increased.  But has been normal ever since (he checks it daily). Absolutely no other symptoms since that episode.  He met with our PCP on 1.29.21 as a follow-up and she directed us to complete this form. She has ordered a consult with a Neurologist and that is scheduled for 3.10.21.  His second shot for the vaccine is due on 2.9.21.

At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.

Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down st.  On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January. At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician&#39;s Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.  Note however I move around very often during a work day and operate a farm tractor and have an active life style.  I have not recently had any extended trips more than 2 hours nor have I flown within the past year or so.

                                                I have had a weekly routine of fasting one day a week for the last 20 years. Sometimes I would extend this to 3 days, water only. I am healthy, 6&#39;1&#34; weight 170-180 all of my adult life. Resting HR &lt;56. 9 days after having my first vaccination, I did a 24 hour fast. I woke at 2 am to go to the bathroom. I became lightheaded and passed out while standing over the toilet. I layed on the floor for over 5 minutes with my head spinning. I then realized I was hypoglycemic. I have never had this issue. I took some orange juice and recovered my strength. I hit my head on the top of the toilet which required my to have 5 sutures in my chin at the ER that night.  Today I was working out for 30 minutes on an elliptical. I work out 4 to 5 times weekly.  10 minutes after returning to my room I noticed I was dizzy and checked my pulse from my watch. My HR was 210. this lasted for over 10 minutes. I have never had this issue.   I believe it would not be in my best interest to take the second vaccination.

Around 6 pm on the day of the injection I noticed that my taste buds were more sensitive. Following that I became very sluggish. So I went to bed shortly afterwards. The following morning I was still sluggish and there was a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. The feeling of tiredness an no energy started and continued until Wednesday the 3rd of March.  That morning I awaken feeling better. I still have a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. But overall I feel great.

I then received a second dose (Lot # EN6206) on 3/13/21.  Over that weekend the pain in my leg grew worse and the leg began to swell. on 3/15, I went to my primary care physician who said it looked like a blood clot. He sent me to a radiologist for an ultrasound (?) of the leg. After confirming the clot, I went to a local ER. They started me on Eliquis to treat the clot

Two workers (from the mental health day program, he went to before the covid lockdown) both advised him to get the second injection, however, and he complied.  After injection he had episodes of difficulty breathing and vomiting for several nights.  Soon after that, he started having to go to the emergency room for blood sugars over 500 (prior to injection his diabetes had been controllable at care home). When he went to ER (for high blood sugar) March 18th, his heart stopped and could not be re-started.  He died.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8732) at the age of 59-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Mar2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. He has no known allergies and has COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, rosuvastatin, oxybutynin, and tamsulosin. There were no other vaccines in four weeks and no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported that he was having some wild effects from the vaccine and did not know what to do. On 26Mar2021 at 15:00, he was having neuropathy like effects. His hands, arms, legs, and feet were experiencing pain and burning sensations, they were burning like nerve damage; he also has a little burning sensation in his nose and cheeks. He has never had this before. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. He was also having some weird sensations in his calf muscles, these sensations started within the past week and a half (Apr2021) which prompted physician office visit. The physician placed him on gabapentin 100 mg to start from 12Apr2021, but it was not enough, it was titrated up to 300 mg, three times a day and he is scheduled to see specialist soon. The patient mentioned that this vaccine has ruined his health. He also went to an urgent care center because his leg was bothering him, it was swelling on an unspecified date in 2021; he thought he had a blood clot; they did some kind of test where they looked at the leg and did not find anything. He didn&#39;t have a particular question. He would just like to talk to someone to see if this was going on with anyone else, if it will go away, or if this was permanent problem he will have. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. He received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 13Apr2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The outcome of the events was not recovered.
