A 40-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Batch/lot number: EK5730, via an unspecified route of administration on 26Dec2020 as a single dose (age at vaccination: 40 years old), right arm for COVID -19 immunization. Medical history included chronic back pain.  Concomitant medication included amitriptyline (AMITRIPTYLINE), cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) for chronic back pain, and hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (NORCO) for chronic back pain. On 26Dec2020, the patient had a &#34;near sick able episode&#34; and a rapid heart rate.  The initial side effect was about 7 minutes after the patient had the vaccine, came on just very quickly. The place where they had the patient discharged him, allowed him to go home, but the rapid heart rate stayed with the patient for next 24 hours and he went to an urgent care and they sent him to emergency room. The patient went to the emergency room (27Dec2020) and they ran an EKG, X-ray, and did a COVID swab; everything came back negative. Lab work, X-ray everything came back fine, the only thing they found was hypoglycemia, heart palpitations, and abnormal EKG, which was described by the reporter as &#34;normal sinus rhythm left axis deviation pulmonary disease pattern&#34; and then at the bottom it said &#34;abnormal EKG.&#34; Heart rate was 136/88 (as reported) so it was definitely improving, the highest it was at 189/110 (as reported). No treatment was received for the events. The clinical outcome of the events &#34;near sick able episode,&#34; rapid heart rate, and palpitations was recovering, while the clinical outcome of hypoglycemia and abnormal ECG was unknown.

A 40-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, lot number: EK5730, exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (vaccine location: left arm) on 18Dec2020 04:15 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy induced asthma, allergies to cats and dust, and occasional seasonal allergies. Concomitant medication included other vaccine/s received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine: first dose of diphtheria vaccine toxoid, pertussis vaccine acellular 3-component, tetanus vaccine toxoid (BOOSTRIX, GlaxoSmithKline) administered as single dose via unspecified route of administration (vaccine location: left arm) on 08Dec2020. There were no other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced persistent shortness of breath and chest tightness starting within a few days after vaccine (24Dec2020). Patient was poorly responsive to her inhalers that she used for asthma (onset date not reported). She rarely needed the, used about once or twice a year). It was constant, but with periods of improvement followed regression. Will likely seek medical evaluation as it&#39;s been over a week now and rather concerning. The patient did not consider the events shortness of breath and chest tightness as serious. Treatment for the adverse events shortness of breath and chest tightness included fluticasone propionate, almeterol (ADVAIR), albuterol, and unspecified anti-allergy medications. Patient did not have covid prior vaccination. Patient was tested for COVID post vaccination wherein patient tested negative for COVID via Covid test rapid on 30Dec2020. The adverse event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of shortness of breath and chest tightness was not recovered and unknown for the other event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of BNT162B2 to the events shortness of breath , chest tightness and asthma aggravated cannot be excluded.

COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his &#34;deconditioning&#34; in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.

                                                Within 8-10 minutes I had a wave of heat start from the back of my head to the front, like the feeling you get right before you go under from anesthesia. My heart began to race and I was lightheaded. I reported the reaction and was given an oximeter to check oxygen and heart rate. Heart rate was 140, oxygen 99. BP was also checked and was normal. Was given water and sat for another 10 minutes. Felt better and heart rate was under 100 until another wave of lightheadedness came over me and heart rate spiked again to over 120. It came down again. A few minutes later lightheadedness came back, shaking started, and heart rate spiked again. It lasted about 10 minutes. After 55 minutes of staying at facility I was able to leave. However, did have one more brief episode of lightheadedness and heart rate spiking. Sore arm and extreme ringing in one ear were only side effect the  following day.

Once he received the vaccine, he became nauseous, sweaty, clammy, dizzy and lightheaded. Pt explained to immunizer that he was switched to night shift and had taken his diabetic meds without food soon before his shift at 5:30pm. An EMT was on scene and she proceeded to call more medics. I checked on the pt and he was vomiting and very pale. Medics checked pt vitals and okayed him for work.

Report 3 of 3. MI filed on report 1 of 3. A 40-year-old-male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (COVID VACCINE, Pfizer product, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot: Number: EL3302, NDC number: Unknown, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included sleep apnea (he started with CPAP and technically it was a BIPAP machine), bipolar disease (took psychiatric medications), lost weight, blood pressure and liver enzymes. On 17Mar2020, he quit smoking. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 26Jan2021, the patient experienced nasal congestion and cough. He had COVID test and it came back positive. It was reported that, &#34;they were vaccinated on 15Jan2021 with first dose. The Wednesday after which was about 5 days after the vaccine her husband got chills, sneezing, and fatigue. He did not call the doctor and did not get tested. About a week later her son had nasal congestion and cough. This was the third day for that. Called her son&#39;s doctor since this was the second person in the house to have symptoms. He had COVID test and it came back positive. Is the COVID vaccine enough to give a positive test. She had symptoms too, but she normally get sinusitis this time of year. No one had a fever. Her son was really congested. Maybe he will develop a fever down the line. She was at a quandary. She had to quarantine in case it was. Could the vaccination cause a positive COVID test result. She thought the symptoms should show up in 1 to 3 days. A week in between her husband and son and it was hard to believe. It should have been her to get it worse since she sleeps with her husband. Praise the Lord she had not. She and her husband had not been tested for COVID. Only her son was COVID tested. Wednesday morning he woke up and he was much more congested. He complained a little on Tuesday. He had sleep apnea and uses CPAP. He might have wanted cough medicine to help him sleep good. He said he did not sleep well. He was very tired and congested. On the evening of 26Jan2021 he was more congested than usual. He was tested yesterday and got positive results this morning. History and Investigations: he was in a lot better shape since living with them because he had lost over 100 pounds. He had sleep apnea. He started with CPAP and technically it was a BIPAP machine. They call it a CPAP. He was 355 pounds and now 228 pounds. Slowly loosing weight. He had bipolar disease and took psychiatric medications. Since he had lost weight he has had to decrease his doses. He was having problems with blood pressure in October. He was starting to feel faint and the doctor stopped his blood pressure medications. He had issues with his liver enzymes and he was not out of the woods yet. He had been a smoker on and off. He quit smoking on 17Mar2020. Caller declined to do provide information about her son&#39;s psychiatric medications and blood pressure medications for report. They bought a blood pressure cuff to keep track of his blood pressure. Since he got sick his blood pressure went up to 121/63. It was normally 110 to 114 over 63 to 70. She had also been keeping an eye on his temp and it went up about a degree. His pulse rate was up which you would expect. His pulse rate was usually between 55 and 68. That day it was 83. There was a product complaint. Caller was patient&#39;s mother. Vaccinated on 15Jan2021 with first dose. About a week later her son had nasal congestion and cough. This was the third day for that. Called her son&#39;s doctor since this was the second person in the house to have symptoms. He had COVID test and it came back positive. Is the COVID vaccine enough to give a positive test. Her son was really congested. Maybe he would develop a fever down the line. Could the vaccination cause a positive COVID test result. On the evening of 26Jan2021 he was more congested than usual. He was tested yesterday and got positive results this morning. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Within few minutes, I started feeling high heart rate and dizzy. Notified health care professional and they took me in to observe vitals. Heart rate and blood pressure was higher than normal. EKG looked normal but with higher heart rate. Started feeling better in an hour and went home. The high heart rate recurred the next several days but would go away after few minutes.  Occasionally I get a headache and feel resting heart rate is higher than before. Definitely feeling better after two weeks compared to day of the shot.

On March 9, he was seen at an urgent care where he was told he had an inverted T wave on his EKG and a very fast heart rate (125 resting pulse). He was told to not exercise and to make an appointment with a cardiologist. On March 9, I called the urgent care clinic to ask questions about monitoring his blood pressure and when to seek more medical care. I spoke with Dr, who prescribed Atenolol. Around 4:30 pm on

Everyday so far feel off and on tired, dry mouth off and on, dehydrated?  Felt tired within an hour of injection on Tuesday.  I don&#39;t remember if my stomach was growling on the first night on the day I got injected and I just went to bed.  The next morning I woke up really thirsty/hungry and tired. I slowly made myself breakfast. Sat down to eat on a stool and felt dizzy. My heart raced for 30 sec as I carefully made my way to the flow to be safe. I had the chills, a bit shaky for a short period. I called my doc who told me to stay hydrated. The clinic where I got injected DID NOT inform me about dehydration. As of today, I still have off and on a dry mouth, feel more of an empty stomach at meal time, tired off and on, and maybe dehydrated. I work from home so I am not pushing myself. I have not felt dizzy again and am decent at taking in water now.

A 40-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, brand: Pfizer), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 24Mar2021 11:30 at age of 40-year-old (Lot Number: ER8733) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Facility of Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. Medical history included gout, anxiety, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, &#39;espoghutis&#39;. The patient did not have allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication within 2 weeks of vaccination included omeprazole; allopurinol; escitalopram. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.

He sat in the waiting area for approximately 2 minutes before coming back and knocking on the consult room door. When we opened the door he said he felt like he was going to pass out and then fell to the floor, hitting the left side of his head against the wall. He quickly regained consciousness after only a second or two and was able to scoot into the consultation room where we had him lie on his back and elevate his legs. We also gave him a cold compress for his head. We paged department and when AP arrived he contacted EMS to come check him over. The patient did not loose consciousness again and was able to hold a conversation with us while waiting. EMS arrived and checked his vitals and came to the conclusion that he did not need an ambulance. After EMS left the patient drank water and orange juice and sat in the consultation room with me for 20 more minutes before leaving. Patient has no previous history of vaccine reactions or history of fainting. He had no reactions to his first dose other than a sore arm.

While waiting the 15 minute observation period, patient came to the pick up window and stated &#34; I do not feel well&#34;. He then squatted down and felt backwards onto his back. He was non responsive for around 30 seconds then regained consciousness. I proceeded to call ED and ran out to assist the patient. By the time I went out there, he regained consciousness. I instructed him to elevate his legs while lying down. Two fire department members assisted us while we waited for emergency services. Person declined to go to the hospital but emergency services advised him todo so since his blood pressure was low. Patient was taken by ambulance to the hospital

                                                Walking to the observation room approximately 2 minutes post shot I felt extreme dizziness.  Felt like I could potentially pass out so I waited 30 minutes in the observation room before leaving.  After I was fairly confident I would not pass out I left the facility.  When I made it outside it felt like the right side of my brain was &#34;not there,&#34; like a portion of my brain was dead.  While driving home approximately 45 minutes post shot I felt numbness and  tingling on the right side of my face.  Mental confusion also started.  I don&#39;t recall the numbness and tingling in my face continuing at this time.  Proceeded home, laid down on the couch to relax and about 3 hours post shot felt my heart racing.  Checked heart rate with pulse oximeter and heart rate was 120 w/98 oxygen.  5 minutes later the heart rate went down to around 90 but blood oxygen went to 90.  I sat up, drank water and pulse/oxygen returned to normal.  The next day the mental confusion continued.  Approx. 24 hours post shot tingling and numbness felt on right side of face.  Couldn&#39;t move lips properly, communicate to my facial muscles.  This lasted around an hour or two.  30 hrs post shot short term memory loss caused confusion when typing texts, following conversation, etc.  Symptoms improved greatly over the next couple of days.  Tiredness/general unwell feeling approximately 48hrs post shot but unremarkable.  By the time I went to a GP 84hours post shot I felt 95%.  Went to a neurologist 108hrs post shot who performed standard tests and all was well.  1 week post shot got into an argument and felt tingling and numbness on right side which lasted approximately 10 seconds.

Severe fatigue and constant fever as high as 105 for three days, and finally went to the ER. Immediately treated for sepsis. Full blood panel, blood cultures, x-ray and CT scan. Also ran some additional cultures for respiratory  pathogens. The Dr?s had a tough time determining what it was. They saw a very small area which they called pneumonia, however, I?ve had pneumonia and this was not what it was. Final discharge paperwork stated Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

The pain kept getting worse and worse each day. I finally had to drive myself to the emergency room (5/4/201)  to get it checked out. It felt like something was squeezing my heart.  i was super light headed and felt like i was going to drop on the floor dead.  They gave me a chest x ray and took blood work.  Everything cam back good and the doctor said if i kept getting those chest pain i should return. so they let me go.  i still kept getting my chest pain for another week. however i didnt go back to the ER, because i was scared of getting a second bill as im not insured.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

On Mon heart rate increased again. Went to Urgent Care and tested covid negative. On Wed 12/30, BP at 180/105. Went to ED and BP eventually went down to 145/95. Dr is speculating that since patient had high antibodies from covid infection in August and still high antibodies in October that all of this is a wild immune reaction triggered by the vaccine.

He was sitting in a designated chair for the protocol 15 min observation and fell from the chair to the ground, hitting the right side of his temporal - redness noted around area with skin intact. Clinic staff immediately moved patient to be lying down on the ground with cervical spine precaution and lifted his legs up on a chair. Vitals: HR 78 and BP 118/72 taken in supine position on ground with legs elevated. Patient was transported by EMS to the ED at 2:45pm. ED note: Patient has Hx of vasovagal syncope in the past with similar symptoms after blood draws..Exam and workup shows well-appearing young man, nonfocal neuro exam, normal gait, cardiopulmonary exam unremarkable, no signs of trauma other than a small hematoma to the right forehead. After evaluation, their Canadian Syncope Risk Score is -3 indicating very low risk for 30 day serious adverse events (&lt;1%). Telemetry monitoring during their ED stay has not captured any events. Discussed next steps with patient: given their low risk for 30 day serious adverse events (including death, serious arrhythmia, MI, PE, ICH), they would prefer to be discharged to continue their workup as an outpatient, rather than admission for observation. Patient was deemed stable to discharged from the ED at 5:57pm with counseling to follow up with PCP in the next 2 days and to return to the ED with any persistent or worsening symptoms.

I noticed that my resting heart rate was way above normal (normal = 76-80 bpm).  My heart rate after about 10pm rose to about 115-120 bpm and stayed at that level for about 12 hours.

                                                Patient screened for first dose of Pfizer vaccine. He checked no history of allergies or reactions to medications or vaccines. In the initial screening he informed me he had a phobia of needles but this is usually with blood draws. He reported he should be fine with vaccinations. I inquired on previous reactions and he denied any allergic reaction just that he does not like them. I asked him how I can help give the vaccine. We had him look away and to think of a different situation. I asked him if he would like to know when I am administering or just use distraction. He chose to be informed when he would feel a slight poke. Vaccine was administered with no issues.  Within the minute following the vaccine patient started to feel dizzy. Hung his head a bit but was responsive. I requested staff assistance to help the situation including RN to prevent any episodes of syncope.  We provided water which he was able to drink. He was still seated and we suggested putting head between legs. This was not comfortable for him so we moved him to the floor. About 3-4 min in he began to sweat a bit more and appeared Pale. We obtained a BP and pulse. BP was 112/60 and pulse around 60.  When he felt hot, sweaty and appeared pale we all decided to call EMS to be cautious. He maintained BP, no SOB, did not lose conscious. EMS evaluated him, med list provided and vitals. He was on medications for anxiety.  They released him after about 30min and reported a panic attack and not related to the vaccine.  Patient walked out of the clinic with his partner and was stable. He is requesting 2nd dose of the vaccine. I informed him nurse would review and would have a plan for future injection.

These all occurred about 12 hours after the second shot and subsided around 36 hours after the second shot.  8.5 days after the second shot I had throat and chest pain.  This pain then continued and got worse to the point I went to the ER and was evaluated for potential heart attack.  After testing - results were that I did not have a heart attack.  I was still experiencing this pain, so the ER took a strep test.  This was also negative.  The diagnosis was &#34;pulled chest muscle&#34;.  I&#39;ve had pulled muscles, I know what those feel like and it sure didn&#39;t feel like what I experienced on the night of the 16th and the day of the 17th of Feb. 2021.

                                                For the first 24 hours I had no symptoms other than arm pain. For the next 6 days experienced debilitating headaches, which led to nausea (because they were so severe). Elevated blood pressure also coupled with headaches.  I initially took Ibuprofen (which helped somewhat), whereas Tylenol did nothing. I also have a flexible ice pack that I placed over my head. That also helped a little. I went to the doctor on March 17th, but he was dismissive of the headaches being related to the vaccine. I have since been referred to  a neurologist (April 1st appointment).

He is a Service Member and reported  high levels of baseline activity, including running 10 miles each Saturday. He received vaccine #1 25 JAN 21 (EN5318) without AE. He received dose #2 on 16 FEB 21, (EN6200). He experienced no immediate symptoms suggestive of IgE event. On day 1 he reports feeling cold, mild fatigue but no other symptoms. On day 2 he was baseline. On day 3 he noted numbness, tightness  and discomfort to his right  calf. On day 4 (Saturday), his usual long run day, he experienced dyspnea and lightheadedness after running 20-30 feet. He states he noted tightness in his calf and instead walked the track while his wife completed her run. He rested day 5.  Day 6 he noted significant edema to his calf, which he describes as double normal in size, and iced it. Day 7, he tried to schedule with PCP and based on triage was sent to ER. ER diagnosed R DVT and bilateral PE&#39;s. He was admitted overnight, started anticoagulation therapy. He saw hematology, and the workup was negative for other causes.

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 03Mar2021 09:00 (batch/lot number: EN9581) as single dose for covid-19 immunization in a workplace clinic. Medical history included ongoing wounds that had not yet healed. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no covid prior vaccination. The patient has no other medications in two weeks. The patient has no other vaccine in four weeks. On 04Mar2021, the patient noticed previous wounds that had not yet healed having extra bleeding. The patient informed that he also never got nosebleeds and had one unexpectedly 1 week after vaccine (Mar2021). The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient had no treatment received due to the events. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Patient still said that he didn&#39;t feel right so EMS was called and the patient was transported to Hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Headache - 4 days and still comes and goes sometimes being very extreme. Fatigue - Started feeling tired around 5:00pm the day of the vaccine and I have continued to feel tired after 4 days. Muscle/Joint pain - Started getting sore arm first a couple hours after shot then progressively getting worse on my entire body for 3 days.  On day two is was almost unbearable with my lower back being the most painful.  I could not sleep because of the pain with no position that would relief it. Chills - Started getting chills on the evening of the vaccine.  They came and went for 3 days. On the second day it was uncontrollable shakes no matter how many blankets I used. Fever - Started the night of my vaccine increasing to 102.4 and reaching the highest on the second day at 103.5.  I took ibuprofen every 6 hours for two days straight with it staying steady at above 100. Nausea - Started the evening of the vaccine and got very severe.  It has continued for 4 days. Fast Heartbeat - It has stayed consistently above 110  and sometime getting up to 130 while laying in bed shivering.

When I arrived at home an hour and a half later I was dizzy again and experienced rapid heart beats. Symptoms lasted for 30 minutes and then the symptoms stopped. While I didn?t experience any more side effects today, I did notice that the are around the injection site is significantly swollen and sore. I?m using an ice pack to help bring the swelling down.

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included drug hypersensitivity from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Allergic to sulfa, PCN and amoxicillin. The patients concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date the patient experienced sleep for a few minutes, I didnt pass out but it was similar, was pulled over for minor traffic violation. He was told to get out of the car and had a field sobriety test, and I looked intoxicated, felt heavy and tired/run down, had a headache, bad diarrhea, upset stomach, sleep for a few minutes, I didnt pass out but it was similar, crashed for 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day which I never do, aching, overall weakness, started feeling sick again at dinner, he went to the bathroom a few times, woke up feeling really bad. The patient was worried because everything was coming to a head right now. The caller got the first shot, he waited for 15 minutes and felt fine. As the caller walked to his car he began feeling heavy, had severe diarrhea, headache, aching, it was almost like he passed out, it felt like he went to sleep. The patient got home and crashed 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day and woke up feeling really bad. The patient went to a very important dinner meeting that night. While the patient was at the meeting he went to the bathroom a few times and then excused himself because he felt so bad. The patient did not even finish one cocktail with dinner. The caller got pulled over for a minor traffic stop, cutting the corner and crossing the line or something small. The officers believed the caller was driving under the influence and started making him do a sobriety test with 40 degree wind gusts, the patient was miserable. The caller told the officers that he needed to seek medical attention but they ignored him. The officers forced the caller to do the urine test. It has been 5 days since his vaccination and he is just now feeling better. The outcome of events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed.  No further information is expected.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine (approximately 5 minutes after), patient said they were feeling light-headed. I went to go get patient water and a granola bar since he hadn&#39;t eaten breakfast and patient passed out. Patient was resting after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine, and was propped against the wall in the corner on a chair, so he was just leaned up against the wall (didn&#39;t fall to the ground). Several patients helped me move the patient to the ground so he was lying horizontal and he woke up almost immediately (max 10 seconds). He wasn&#39;t quite oriented to what had just happened but knew he was on the ground. Within 1 minute, patient knew where he was, was feeling fine and wanted to sit back on the chair. He was carrying on a full conversation and did not feel feverish, sweating, tired, faint, or have a headache, just embarrassed. Patient stayed for a full 30 minutes and wanted to drive himself home because he felt completely back to normal. Vaccine administrator calling to check up on patient during next available break.

The patient then fell to the floor from a seated position in a chair in the observation area. The EMT and Paramedic immediately responded to the patient. They assessed the patient and brought him into a wheelchair once he was feeling well enough to do so. The patient never lost consciousness. Initial vitals: BP 96/60, O2 95% on room air, RR 24, HR 64. The Paramedic took a 12-lead EKG, result was Sinus rhythm with apparent ST elevation. Subsequent EKG was sinus brady with apparent ST elevation. The patient was free of contusions or scrapes from his fall from the chair. PT initially refused transportation to the emergency department. After some convincing, the patient was agreeable to seek elevated medical treatment and was transported by ambulance.

A 41-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Apr2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included G72.3 periodic paralysis. Concomitant medication included diclofenamide (KEVEYIS) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received other vaccines within four weeks. It was unknown if the patient had covid prior vaccination. The physician stated that the patient received the Pfizer vaccine on Sunday 04Apr2021. The patient collapsed about an hour and half later and, has felt very weak and was experiencing muscle pain since then - all experienced on 04Apr2021. The patient has also been experiencing weakness, confusion, fatigue, and shortness of breath all since Sunday 04Apr2021. The physician reported that there were two different kinds of potassium in the vaccine which he felt was contributing to this. It was informed that the patient has been currently resting and will follow-up if his symptoms don&#39;t improve. The outcome of the adverse events was unknown. It was unknown if treatment was received for the adverse events. It was unknown if the patient was tested for covid post-vaccination.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and temporal relationship, a possible contributory role between BNT162B2 vaccine and the reported events can not be excluded.  Case will be re-assessed upon the additional information provided. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                3/26 @ 3:15pm ? Got the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for the 1:10pm appointment. However actual time received was around 3:15pm. No vaccine reaction was observed and drove back home. However did not eat or drink much from morning till 4:30pm due to the long line at the vaccination center   4/4 @ 9:00pm ? Experienced first sign of near-syncope at the dinner table upon picking up a glass of milk  4/6 @ 8:45am ? Experienced brain fog, to be exact head felt like it was filled with cotton candy, at the back and top of the head. Felt this way the entire day. Went to work as usual. Logged out at around 5:30pm  4/7 @ 9:00am ? dizziness started getting worse. Started feeling imbalance and started losing depth perception which climbing down staircase  4/8 @ 10:00am ? started to get easily startled by any unexpected trigger. Whole body would ?twitch? or ?startle? upon slightest unexpected event. For e.g., sound, touch, taste (hot/cold)  4/10 @ 12:00pm ? Went to ER. ER ordered series of book tests, EKG, chest x-ray. Everything came out normal. ER doctor said to wait it out and after a week symptom may go away. ER doctor felt body?s immune response was over-working due to the vaccine immune response and possibly pollen allergy I may have experienced right after getting the vaccine. No prescription meds give. Advised to take Meclizine 25mg and Zyrtec. Below are the symptoms experienced on 4/10:  ? Lightheadedness/Sudden Jerking body movements when triggered/passing out momentarily for a second when taking strain/not in my elements ? Feeling extremely fatigued. Did not sleep well at night on 4/8 and 4/9 ? Head feels Intoxicated, foggy, lightheaded, as if stuffed with cotton candy. Startled when unexpected things happen like a sudden jerking movement along with momentary passing out while anything unexpected happens. E.g., when I am pushing myself on the sofa to re-position, I feel my whole body is turning off for a second. Simply does not feel normal ? Rubbery legs ? Worsens after shower. I feel like I need to lay down as the foggy feeling worsens after shower ? Lightheadedness. Losing control sometimes. ? I am easily startled when climbing down the stairs - no Depth perception. ? Don?t have the strength to blow nose or cough. Feels like momentary fainting when doing these activities ? Dis-equilibrium. Whole body is twitching when something unexpected happens to my senses. ? Unable to control while laughing feels like momentary faint. I have felt like this when I was down with a fever. Tickled easily ? Difficulty pulling myself out of bed. Felt like muscle was giving away ? Tingling feeling in the right abdomen area ? Difficulty staying alert or focused and random rather unpleasant thoughts constantly coming to mind. Felt a bit of panic attack.  4/11 ? Went to PCP. Body weakness and fatigue got worse. PCP did blood sugar test and flushed out the left ear. Ordered Brain MRI to see if structurally anything was wrong. Brain MRI came out OK as well however noticed minor sinusitis. Prescribed Amoxicillin antibiotics and nasal spray. Referred me to Neurologist and Head and Neck Specialist.  4/11 ? 4/15 - Above symptoms progressively got worse. Especially weakness in the arms and shoulders. Arms quivered every time trying to stand up and felt like fainting. Hand-eye coordination progressively got worse. For e.g., could not pick up water bottle, hands were quivering badly  4/15 ? Neurologist conducted certain diagnostic tests and concluded that there are no neurological issues. Said with rest and plenty of fluids it should get better. Spinal tap was not recommended and said if symptoms got worse a spinal tap can be done during the next visit. Follow up visit with neurologist scheduled on 4/27  4/15 ? 4/27 ? Weakness in arms got better. Arm strength and coordination has improved however it?s still not back to normal. Brain fog and dizziness still persists with no improvement. Left limb and arms are stronger than the left. Difficulty climbing up and down stairs. Dizziness worsens after shower. Not feeling myself. In addition, not able to multitask - getting startled and need to be deliberate about having to do everyday chores need to just focus on one task 100% completely and if something else comes up then my body just goes into a momentary shock. Mostly I can feel my head feeling heavy and my eyelids shutting down when something shocking happens ? a feeling like body is ?turning off?, almost a fainting or passing out feeling. Sometimes when I turn to one side and sleep, I can feel a flickering sensation in the ear. Still always feeling woozy and as if there is something in my head ? a medicated or intoxicated feeling in the head  4/27 ? Neurologist said she sees a lot of improvement and reiterated again that I don?t have any neurological issues. She said I can go back to work starting 5/1. She said I may have Conversion Disorder / Disequilibrium. It?s hard for me to fathom why she would diagnose me with Conversion Disorder when so many people are reporting very similar symptoms that I am facing on the below forum: https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/dizziness-among-common-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/  4/30 ?

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 28Apr2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal, blood cholesterol abnormal, deafness. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included unspecified products received within 2 weeks of vaccination.

The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and since the vaccination, he has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient reported a potential false blood pressure readings on 29Apr2021, a day after administered 2nd dose. The readings were over 200/140 and he took it at home using a blood pressure reading device. He took it on his wrist and measured at 215/147. In his recent doctors visit prior to administer the 2nd dose, the accurate readings was 183/136 (estimated). With the false blood pressure readings, the pain at the location of the lower arm got near tremble due to the fact of the false readings has been taken. The events outcome was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                About a week after receiving the 1st Pfizer Covid vaccine, I started experiencing heart palpitations and difficulty walking up stairs and/or hills.  I visited the ER the following day because I did not have a doctor nearby.    I was referred to a local doctor, who I visited May 6, 2021.  He dismissed the notion that anything was caused by the vaccine and put me on a low dose (5mg) blood pressure medicine and a 81mg aspirin.  Around 3-4 days after visiting the doctor, I started to feel normal again.  Since then I have felt 100% and back to healthy eating and exercise routine.  Nothing like this has happened to me before, and it was an abnormal situation.  I have not received any other vaccines in many years.

                                                Patient passed out after the vaccine....He had mentioned a history of vaso-vagel response when he got a shot as a teenager.  He was sitting for about 5 minutes then told us he didn&#39;t feel well, then passed out.  However, he came to very quickly.  He was given a cold compress, some water and was sitting with legs up.  We observed him for 45 minutes until he felt well enough to leave.  I don&#39;t think this was a problem with the vaccine due to a similar history while receiving a different vaccine in the past.

Of note, had a fever and chills when falling asleep night of 5/28  On 5/29 woke with specific chest pain localized to heart area. Waited approximately one hour to see if symptoms abated, then proceeded to ER to get checked out. EKG showed left branch block. Administration of Nitro and asprin alleviated chest pain. Was admitted to hospital for observation and testing to ensure heart functioning properly.

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in right arm on 22Dec2020 15:00 as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included covid-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. There is no other vaccine in four weeks. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19, covid test type post vaccination was Nasal Swab on 29Dec2020, covid test result was negative. Starting 5 days post vaccine (26Dec2020 18:00), ongoing symptoms of labile BP; rapid heart rate; migraines; body aches; chest pain and tightness; inflammation. Now going on 6 months of ongoing issues that have resulted in 4 ED visits, multiple tests and numerous doctor&#39;s office visits. There is some treatment (Medication) for AE. The adverse event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of the events was resolving.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known safety  profile it  is unlikely that the reported events were causally related to  bnt162b2.  These are probably  intercurrent  medical conditions. Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Worst I&#39;ve ever felt in my adult life, like my whole body was rebelling against me.  Long-term (for roughly 10 days after both shots): Serious shortness of breath, irregular and very high heartbeat, extreme fatigue. Couldn&#39;t do any physical activity without immediately becoming out of breath (normally very healthy and active). Heart would race unpredictably, reaching 120 bpm (normal resting for me is 60-70). General malaise. Felt more like 80 years old than 40. Was unable to do normal physical activity and work for weeks.  Feeling better overall, but still sometimes feel like I get tired unusually easily and heart behaves strangely now and then.

Denies any fevers recorded at home. He feels like he has extra beats intermittently. Also reports some nausea, but denies vomiting or diarrhea. He has maintained good PO intake since symptoms started, but is worried he may be a bit dehydrated because he had a small AKI when he had covid back in March?.  Etiology of chest pains unclear, but given all of the above workup, unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac or pulmonary etiology.&#34;  He continued to have palpitations for the next week and had further EKG&#39;s don thru urgent care.

                                                About 3 minutes after receiving the shot, I became dizzy.  After 15 minutes, I was still dizzy.  I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

                                                I have a history of auto immune anemia and ITP.  I checked with my hematologist when scheduled if I should take the shot.  They stated to take it as not enough data was present to prevent me to take.  On 02/11, I spoke with doctors onsite and discussed my medical history.  They advised to take the shot as not enough data was present to prevent me to take.  On 02/14, I noticed bleeding in gums and petechiae at the injection site.  I went to hematologist on 02/15, and platelets were at 2,000.  I started 60 mg of prednisone immediately on 02/15.  By 02/19, took blood sample and eceived one 70g dose of IVIG.  Blood results came back on 02/20, and platelets were at 22,000 but did not cover results from after IVIG treatment.  Hematologist decided to stop follow up IVIG treatment and stick to 60mg of prednisone daily as in the past my body has reacted well to it.  On 02/24, platelet count went to 300,000.  I&#39;ve started to taper prednisone to 50mg and will continue with weekly blood tests to verify that platelets remain strong.  Hemoglobin and all over blood levels in the CBC remained normal during this time.  Hematologist has advised not to take second Pfizer COVID-19 shot due to risk.

We stayed by patient, protected his head, allowed him to come to, took coat off and applied ice packs, took BP/pulse (normal) and patient was oriented x3. EMS arrived and took over.

Was rushed to hospital where I was admitted very quickly. I was blacking out on the drive there and blacked out while in their care. This was from one dose of Pfizer vaccine for Covid. I was put on a GI, Allergy, and steroid medications. I was hooked up to an IV and 3 drugs were injected. I passed out numerous times but was discharged at 5am.

When I went to see that patient, he was laying on the floor with his eyes rolled in the back of his head and was unresponsive. He was not alert. He started having a mild seizure and I rolled him over on his left side. While I was bracing the patient, pharmacist came in and administered an Epi-pen to his left thigh. Patient stopped seizing so I rolled him back on his back. He became alert and was able to provide me his name, DOB and what he was at the pharmacy for. I rested my hand under his head and monitored his pulse until the paramedics arrived

                                                Patient was given first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  I counseled the patient on side effects and asked him to wait 15 minutes afterwards in our waiting area.  After about 5 minutes, the patient starting complaining of feeling dizzy.  We asked him to sit back in the chair and brought him a bottle of water.  I asked the patient if he had eaten today and he replied no.  I offered a snack and also a glucose tablet to help with shakiness.  As I went to get a bottle of glucose tablets off the shelf, the patient fainted and fell out of his chair.  I immediately ran to get an Epipen while my technicians called for a Code White and 911.  I was about to inject the patient with the Epipen when he came to about 10 seconds later.  He said he was really hot, sweaty, dizzy, and nauseous.  Paramedics and AP arrived to evaluate him and take a statement.  Patient left on his own will and received a ride home from his mother-in-law, who is an associate at our store.

                                                Paramedic called to observation for 42 YO male with dizziness, lightheaded, and anxiety.  Upon arrival PT found sitting in chair A&amp;OX4, skins: pink/warm/dry, pupils: Equal and reactive. Pt speaks very little English and PT&#39;s wife translated for him.   PT states that he started feeling symptoms 10 minutes after receiving his Pfizer vaccine. Upon assessment PT states he has 10/10 chest pain non radiating/dull in nature with increased pain on inspiration. Pt states that this has happed before a few months ago and was diagnosed with HTN but was not prescribed any medication by his primary care physician. PT does not take any medications and has no allergies. Pt status did not improve or decrease while in the care of the paramedic. Pt vitals then assessed and were as follows: 0943: BP 172/118, HR 71, RR 24, SPO2 99% RA, Lungs clear/equal bilaterally. 1002: BP 180/131, HR 80, RR22, SPO2 98% RA, Lungs clear/equal bilaterally. The paramedic made the decision to activate the EMS 911 system.  Upon EMS arrival report given to responding paramedics and PT care transferred. EMS Paramedics began to treat patient for Chest Pain Protocol, and transported PT to Local ER.

                                                Approximately one week after my second dose my right leg began swelling. For three weeks after the swelling began it would get better than get worse. On Tuesday, March 30, 2021 my entire leg swelled  to twice its normal size at which time I went to the emergency room and a blood clot was diagnosed in my right leg. I completed a multitude of tests and bloodwork with a hematologist and there are no factors or reasons they can identify as to why I developed a blood clot.

                                                3.5 hours after the vaccine shot my body shot full of adrenaline and my heart raced up to 150 beats per minute. I ended up checking myself into the emergency room 5 hours after the vaccine shot because my heart rate wouldn&#39;t slow down and my blood pressure increased. They found out my heart had gone into atrial fibrillation. I have had no known history of atrial fibrillation in the past and prior EKG&#39;s at physicals have been normal.   I am an otherwise healthy individual.The doctor conducted an emergency  Cardioversion to return the heart rhythm to normal.

                                                Pt was found in severe distress in the bathroom by his wife.  He couldn&#39;t walk or stand, complained of being dizzy with slurred speech and was throwing up a lot. 911 was immediately called. The EMTs during their assessment said his BP was normal but when he was asked his name, he started saying the alphabet&#34;ABC... XYZ&#34;.  He was transported by ambulance to ER. Cat scan showed he had a bleed on the brain.  The doctors told us it was because he had very high blood pressure, however where the bleed was, they said he wouldn&#39;t need surgery and that the body would reabsorb it over time.  He was admitted to the ICU and has been there ever since.  Several days later, he started having difficulty breathing and they discovered several blood clots in his right leg that had broken off into his heart and lungs.  He had emergency surgery to remove the clots in his heart (approximately 10) and was given heparin in small doses over an 8 hour period so that it wouldn&#39;t cause the bleed in his brain to increase.  The doctor should fill in the rest.

Circa 9pm I began to have  significant trouble breathing, experienced acute pain in my abdomen, and began to hear ringing in my ears combined with feeling like I was going to pass out. I didn?t feel dizzy, rather I started getting tunnel vision that blocked out more of my field of view as the ringing increased.  Circa 11pm, I lost consciousness while trying to move and collapsed on the floor. My wife called 911 while I was unresponsive, and I regained consciousness while being attended to by EMTs who checked my vitals. Around 12am I didn?t feel like I was going to lose consciousness again, and the EMTs recommended I be taken to the hospital. Since I was feeling better I politely declined.   Today I am still feeling foggy and have joint pain (in addition to some bruising from falling after losing consciousness , but I no longer have the acute abdominal pain.

I gave him his immunization quickly and he did well.  He stood up and watched as I immunized his wife.  He said he was feeling okay afterwards so both him and his wife left the immunization room.  Shortly after leaving he must have started getting dizzy, because next thing I hear is that there is an unconscious man in the waiting room.  He is sitting in a chair with his head back unresponsive.  His wife if rubbing his arms and lightly slapping his face.  He comes to, and we decide to move him to the room that the clinic uses (we have a walk in clinic staffed with a NP).  He lays on the floor, and within a minute he proceds to vomit approximately 4 times.  He also lost control of his bladder.  He was pale with cold and clammy skin.  we moved him so we could put his feet up on a chair and allowed him to rest.  Someone went to get him an ice pack to put on his head and chest.  His blood pressure was low (90/50ish).   He still was not feeling better after 30 minutes so we called the ambulance.  He did not want to go to the hospital so the paramedics monitored him.  his blood pressure slowly started going up and normalizing, and he left with his wife.

Intestinal and abdominal pain (gut wrenching, pain/burning sensation, cramps). At times feels like radiation or waves/currents are passing through my intestines/trunk. I wake up with intestines feeling sore. I also have discomfort when I eat or drink something the following morning. Also, my trunk/core area feels tight all day and night. I constantly feel a burning sensation in my chest and gut areas. The discomfort in my chest area (tightness, burning sensation) with occasional burst of pain the size of a nickel that comes from the left side of my chest and underneath my rib cage.  3. Limbs twitch/jerk on their own (both hands, both feet, neck, both shoulders, both legs, fingers) during the day and during the night. tingling sensations in legs.  4. ringing in the ears with headaches. 5.

A 42-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL1284, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm (at the age of 42 years old) on 08Jan2021 14:30 as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There were no medical history (reported as none) and no concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (brand as Pfizer) for Covid-19 immunisation on 18Dec2020 (at the age of 42 years old) at 03:30 PM administered on the right arm. The vaccine was administered on a hospital. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. On 08Jan2021 11:00 PM, the patient experienced personality changes, headaches, and extreme fatigue, and also was unaware on conversations that he had. The symptoms lasted about 24 hours acutely, but for the 3 weeks afterwards, patient had high blood pressure and insomnia (2021). It would seem that patient had cerebritis from the shot since an unspecified date in 2021. Adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. There were no treatments received in response to the events reported. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered with lasting effects.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is too limited to make a meaningful medical assessment. Based on the available clinical data, the event encephalitis most likely represented an intercurrent medical condition not related to vaccination with BNT162B2. This case will be re-assessed when relevant follow-up information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 42-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Apr2021 12:50 (at the age of 42 years old), as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included high cholesterol from 2011 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated that he got his shot on Monday 12Apr2021 (he confirmed it was his first dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) and then went on 14Apr2021 his heart started to beat fast, he read on the fact sheet and he asked if that may be a sign he had an allergic reaction. He went to his doctor, her EKG came back normal, he saw a cardiologist. He asked if he should get second dose. Second was scheduled for 03May2021. He didn&#39;t know either. As per response it was reported that as noted in the fact sheet for recipients, patient should not get the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE if he had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if he had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason could not be made by Pfizer. They referred him to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. His healthcare provider knew his health situation and had access to information that could better help inform this decision. The patient experienced dull pain: caller reported that on Wednesday, 14Apr2021, after his heart started beating fast and slowed itself down, it started to hurt. The patient reported that the dull pain was not as bad. The patient had EKG on 14Apr2021 with abnormal result (as reported). The outcome of the event &#39;dull pain: caller reported that on Wednesday, 14Apr2021, after his heart started beating fast and slowed itself down, it started to hurt&#39; and &#39;heart started to beat fast&#39; was recovering; outcome of the remaining event was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (22Apr2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer (patient) includes: reaction data (additional event: &#39;dull pain: caller reported that on Wednesday, 14Apr2021, after his heart started beating fast and slowed itself down, it started to hurt&#39;), suspect product details (administration site and time), patient details (medical history and lab data) and event details (outcome of the events updated).

Pt states that after receiving his 2nd dose on 05/06, he noticed his leg stiffness got significantly worse. He tells me that he tried to &#34;push through the pain&#34; and mow his lawn but had to stop d/t severe cramping of the LLE and pelvis. He states he rested his leg and went to bed, and when he woke up he noticed that his left leg was severely swollen. Pt decided to take 3 days off work to continue to rest the leg, but ultimately came in for evaluation at the suggestion of his coworkers. Pt denies fever, chills, chest pain, or SOB. He denies history of smoking, prior clotting, long car travel, air travel, leg injury, or recent surgery.    On exam, the left lower extremity is significantly swollen, erythematous, and hot to the touch. Physical exam otherwise unremarkable. Will admit to the hospitalist service for further medical management.   ED Course: Hypertensive with BP 170/93. Initial workup significant for WBC 13, K 3.3, glucose 159.

                                                After receiving my second Pfizer Covid Vaccine shot last week (11-May-2021), I suffered nose bleed (left nose) on Saturday morning (15-May-2021) and didn&#39;t think much about it. This continued Sunday (16-May-2021), Monday (17-May-2021) and also today Tuesday afternoon (18-May-2021). The amount of bleeding increased significantly through to today and the last 3 times I noticed bleeding in the back of my throat. And I initially tried applying pressure to the nose section and now it is taking more than 15 - 20 minutes for this to stop. I am very concerned and will be contacting my Primary physician as soon as possible.  Actually I had 2 other instances of nose bleeds after the first shot (14-Apr-2021) but I brushed it aside thinking it was due to cold weather or irritation from picking. I have not had nose bleeds prior to this event. I did not have any fever or chills from both vaccinations other than the sore left arm so this was not weighing my mind much. However, now I am concerned at the adverse events following Pfizer Covid vaccination shots.

Chills and uncontrollable shivers started about 30 minutes in and lasted for 2 hours.  By 3pm I felt better.  2 bags of IV, chest x-ray, and blood work showed everything normal.

She just wanted to report that her husband got the first shot 28Apr2021 and Friday 07May2021 he was admitted to the hospital with 3 pulmonary embolisms. When asked when the pulmonary embolism began she says the week before the hospitalization, so the week he actually got the first dose, he was complaining of the back of his leg hurting, in the upper calf area. She says it was either the day after the shot or the next day that he said his leg hurt but he did not think too much about it and it resolved after a couple days and then Wednesday, 05 May 2021 he started getting discomfort in his left upper quadrant, she clarifies his abdomen and rib cage area, and he started having really bad headaches Thursday that continued and during the night  Thursday night his left shoulder started bothering him and it was radiating from his shoulder up to his chin as well as he had the severe headache so the doctor told him to go to the ER. The patient experienced three pulmonary embolisms on an unspecified date with outcome of not recovered. The patient was hospitalized for 3 pulmonary embolisms from 07May2021 to 08May2021. He also started having really bad headaches on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown and he was complaining of the back of his leg hurting on an unspecified date with outcome of recovered, his left shoulder started bothering him and it was radiating from his shoulder up to his chin on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pulmonary embolism and included Eliquis which he would be on for at least 3 months.

                                                Patient was given has second dose of Pfizer. He did not have any reactions with his first dose. He felt dizzy, nauseous and had a stomachache. He was also feeling hot and complained of feeling a tingling sensation in his fingers. This was a few minutes after the vaccine was given and he was sitting at the post-immunization area. We directed him to sit on the floor and gave him 2 cold packs to put on his neck. Patient looked pale and weak so we also gave him some cold water. After a few minutes of sitting, he asked for us to call 911. We called 911 and alerted management. After paramedics came, patient was taken away. Patient seemed to be doing fine as he was leaving. He regained color in his lips, but was still feeling the other symptoms.

                                                10 min after injection, my mouth started getting hot, then it moved down my throat and it was difficult and painful to swallow. I got quite dizzy. They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

The next day i was able to return to work.

My heart started to race and it progressively increased to the point where the resting rate was anywhere from 130-160 beats per minute.  When I would move it would increase to the 180s.  As of today, the 21st, my resting heart rate has decreased to the 100s and when I move it increases to the 110s.

                                                I had some sort of reaction.  I was glad to get the shot and was not nervous about getting the shot. 5 minutes after the shot I felt something cold go down my left arm from my shoulder to my hand.  A minute or two after that both my hands went numb, then both my arms went numb.  I asked others around me if anyone felt anything and everyone else was fine.  A minute or two after that both my legs went numb. I started to black out but made it to a chair before this happened,  I drank some cold water and felt awake about 5 minutes later.  30 minutes after that i felt comfortable enough to walk.  For the rest of the day i felt like i was legally drunk and felt lots of pins and needles on the back of my hands and feet. I did not feel dizzy or nauseous at that time. i also felt a lot of pressure on the inside of my skin all over my body. I&#39;ve never felt anything like that and it was a bit uncomfortable.  The next day i was too dizzy to walk without becoming very nauseous.  I still had pins and needles on my feet. i had chills as well which i guess is a good sign.  my appetite was fine. i felt clear-headed as well.  Two days after the shot i felt slightly dizzy and by the third day i felt fine except for minor muscle cramps all over my body.  For the three days after the shot i also had some pretty strong forearm and calf muscle cramps and my arms (biceps and triceps) felt pumped up like i just had a great arm workout, but they weren&#39;t swollen at all.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

Severe myalgias - in the epigastric cisternal area and in the back of my shoulder blades. 36 hours later - low grade temperature. At 48 hours I felt normal. Eye - 10 days later (vaccine) - I noticed a visual deficit in the left eye along with a line and the following day - on the 17th, I saw my ophthalmologist - left branch retinal vein occlusion.  Since then I&#39;ve had an Forestine Angiogram:  and a video of my retina - branch retina arterial occlusion - so they are having trouble telling the difference between the two. I still am being followed for my eye. They did a carotid ultrasound - my carotids are fine. I am due to get an echo cardiogram. I am taking baby aspirin mg for now - not sure if it&#39;s helping or not. It takes a year and a half to go away.

No chest pain, no fevers, chills, cough. He saw his PCP for these symptoms who ordered EKG and CXR 1 day PTA which per patient were normal--plan was for referral to cardiologist. However on the morning on presentation around 6:45 AM after taking an elevator for work he began feeling lightheaded and lost consciousness, awakening on the floor. He went home as he was not feeling well however proceeded to have another 2-3 episodes of loss of consciousness at home witnessed by his girlfriend--the later 2 occurred while lying down and were not clearly associated with any presyncopal symptoms.

                                                On March 24 I got the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and I experienced side effects almost immediately. By the time I got to the resting/observation area I felt that the site of the injection got really warm and I became dizzy/lightheaded and started to feel heavy on the chest and little problem in swallowing and breathing. I was taken to the paramedics on site, they checked my blood pressure (which a little high 150/90), oxygenation, pulse, and EKG (which were normal). It did not became too bad after and was allowed to come back home.  However, the heavy chest and swallowing problem lasted for three days. The heaviness in the chested turned into a sensation of feeling like my trachea or the anything under the sternum area was behind strangled. Although I felt like this my breathing and swallowing was almost normal. Every now and then when I swallowed I felt some pain but I could withstand it.

                                                I had trouble after the shot, with a chronic headache that started a couple hours after the shot and wouldn?t break no matter what I took or did.  I also had chest soreness and a reduced heart rate that started about 4 days after the second shot, which was similar to what I felt when I thought I had COVID in 2020 (my doctor denied my request to be tested and told me to just quarantine until my symptoms were gone for 48 hours).  I tried everything to resolve my symptoms.  I could get my heart rate up with vigorous exercise (mountain biking), and it would recover just fine, but the chest soreness and headache persisted.  After a week, I called my doctor?s office to get in for an evaluation, thinking my thyroid medication needed adjustment.  The doctor who saw me sent me to the ER because she had no answers as to the headache and very low heart rate, which kept dropping into the 30?s... normal is around 50 for me.  She thought I could be having a heart attack.  After 4 hours and a couple tests, the ER released me with no trouble found.  I still had the headache, and slow heartrate with mild chest soreness.  The headache subsided about 4 days later, and my heart rate returned to normal.  The chest soreness continued for 4 weeks, and is still present, but slowly improving I think.

                                                The next day after the second shot, my right foot got acute pain. I had some  fatigue  on my left foot on the day I took vaccine and I had got it examined by the doctor, He did. To find any issue on my left foot and suggested it might be a regular sprain. He also examined throughly the right foot and it was perfectly fine in the day time of vaccinations. The pain on right foot joints got so acute that I could not move out of my bed. I waited for two days hoping that the vaccine effect will go in couple of days.but it became unbearable. I saw my pcp and the blood work showed erratic inflammatory markers and unusable high glucose very low platelets and I was given steroid for six days. The inflammation was coming down when I was on med and bed rest, last Saturday my right heel started showing a new and sharp throbbing pain. I went the ortho and they found that possibly my burssaties sack is inflameated. The pain is so unbearable that I am, prescribed some opioid based pain killers, the PCP and hematologists had a discussion , I was told that I may be developing auto immune disorder. I never had a history of ITP.  I am still hopi g it is a shock and body will calm down soon but I am on so much in pain and in a small place to get an immediate medical attention is so hard.

                                                massive heart attack; knee pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 43-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Mar2021 12:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart attack in 2019, heart disorder (Heart),  Blood cholesterol abnormal (cholesterol), hurt his knee at work prior and torn meniscus. Concomitant medications included ongoing ticagrelor (BRILINTA) for the heart; ongoing atorvastatin for cholesterol and ongoing carvedilol (COREG) for the heart. The patient previously took clopidogrel (PLAVIX) for heart attack. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No adverse events following prior vaccinations. The patient called about the COVID 19 vaccine. He received his first COVID-19 vaccine on 12Mar2021 and suffered a massive heart attack on the same day. After the event, his cardiologist reviewed video from the heart catherization to open the blockage and the cardiologist indicated that the area that was obstructed with this heart attack had not been obstructed 2 months ago. The cardiologist believed that the COVID 19 vaccine is the culprit in causing the massive heart attack. The cardiologist believed the area of the blockage was too dramatic. The cardiologist encouraged the caller to report the event and the cardiologist will offer his expertise in this matter if needed. The patient also tried to report to his local health department but is waiting on a call back from them. He reported that he had a heart attack in 2019. He was taking Plavix but after this heart attack his cardiologist has changed some of his medications. He reported he believes his medications were changed at his follow up visit with the cardiologist on 23Mar2021. He reported that he had continuous blood work done while in the hospital. They were monitoring his troponin levels. He also had a chest X-Ray, EKG and after the heart attack he had an echocardiogram to monitor the extent of the damage caused by the heart attack. He clarified that he did go to the emergency department on 12Mar2021, the same day he received the Covid 19 vaccine, but for knee pain. He received a pain relief injection of fentanyl that day. He had hurt his knee at work prior. He had previously had an MRI of his knee that showed a torn meniscus. He does not believe his knee pain on 12Mar2021 is related to the Covid 19 vaccine as he had already had an MRI that showed a torn meniscus. He had gone to the emergency department for pain management of his knee. He thought he would be given a lower strength pain medication but received Fentanyl. While the patient was at the emergency room for his knee, he suffered a massive heart attack. The patient clarified that he went to the emergency department because of pre-existing knee pain and while at the emergency department caller suffered a massive heart attack. The patient was hospitalized for massive heart attack from 12Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The outcome of the event heart attack was recovering while the outcome of the event knee pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal association between BNT162B2 and the massive heart attack cannot be completely excluded. The knee pain was assessed as an intercurrent condition and is unrelated to BNT162B2.

                                                Three days after my second shot (on 05/03/2021) I started to feel pain in my left arm, tightness in chest, and I became very light headed.  I tried to go to shower but I could not walk and laid down.  My ears felt very tingly and I thought I was going to pass out but as far as I know, I did not.    I went to my primary care doctor and he has me taking baby aspirin daily (in case blood clot) and wanted to see if it got better I am going to follow up with a cardiologist.  I&#39;ve never had a problem with heart before and get an annual physical at work.

A 43-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine, solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), 1ST DOSE SINGLE via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 27Mar2021 for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced chest pain made him go to the emergency room because it was too much, it was multiple throughout the day not just one time, has had a bad headache where it feels like he has vibrating inside of his head, in his chest and on 31Mar2021, when he falls asleep he wakes up in an hour 31Mar2021, getting shocked in the middle of the night when he is sleeping- in his chest and intestines on 31Mar2021, getting shocked in the middle of the night when he is sleeping- in his chest and intestines on 31Mar2021, limbs twitch on 31Mar2021, his penis sensations are a lot different. It was reported that 5 days after he got the first dose of the COVID vaccine he started getting pains and the major thing is at night. If he falls asleep, he wakes up in an hour and that has been every night for a month and a half. That is the main thing that is pissing him off. He confirms that he is having issues with his chest and his intestines like he mentioned previously and he has started keeping track and has kept a journal of the pains. This stuff is new. He has never experienced this before and it has been happening every day starting 5 days after when he got the COVID vaccine. He had the COVID vaccine on 27Mar2021 and on 31Mar2021 he got the first shock in his chest at 0120 in the morning when he was sleeping. Then that went on for a week, he had it on 31Mar2021, 01Apr2021, 02Apr2021, 03Apr2021 and 04Apr2021 where he was getting shocked in the middle of the night when he is sleeping. On 04Apr2021 he had to go to the emergency room and have them look at him. But since 31Mar2021 he has been getting up every hour after he falls asleep. This was all worse when it first started because he has never experienced anything like this. The first shock he had was a hard feeling in his chest and then he couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. It is so bad. After he went to the emergency room, that is when it started being not as much of a shock pain that woke him up but he was still waking up every hour. The pains are in his upper chest and in his intestines. Also his limbs twitch and he has had a bad headache where it feels like he has vibrating inside of his head, in his chest and in his abdomen. He confirmed that these also began on 31Mar2021 and have been happening whenever they want and he has never experienced all of that before. Never. Everything has all stayed the same. The sad part is that he just thinks that he is getting used to this &#34;new normal&#34; because he is now going on the second month of this and his body is adapting but this is not normal. Also, he guesses that he shouldn&#39;t be shy now but the last thing is that his penis sensations are a lot different and he didn&#39;t notice until the first time that he was having relations with his wife after the COVID vaccine and it is all different. He noticed and she did too as far as whenever they were trying to have relations. It has been more than once, it has been every time they have tried afterwards. He says his doctor is going to send him to a sleep lab but he wasn&#39;t expecting that. He thought that maybe he would need to go somewhere else. But there he will go to sleep and be hooked up and they will read his whole body and tell the reason why he is waking up every hour. The outcome of the event headache, sleep disorder, chest discomfort, muscle twitching was not recovered and penis order, headache was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Developed high fevers roughly 12 hours later with rigors.  Was seen in the emergency department.  Found to be febrile, significantly tachycardic (sinus) .  Was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone empirically.  Felt ill for the next 48 hours afterwards with weakness, slow to resolve tachycardia and cough.  Neck swelling subsided however, right neck lymphadenopathy persisted for well over a month.  Was sent home from ED with Bactrim and keflex for coverage of possible neck cellulitis.  However, I do not believe it was a cellulitis.  Neck was not tender, not indurated nor erythematous.  I am a hospitalist and had colleagues take a look as well.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 44-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EH9899) 1st dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 in the evening time (around 6-7 or maybe a little later) at single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the COVID Vaccine that same day, his heart rate went up and then it came down and he was fine. Later that night while sleeping he got up again because he could feel his heart rate going up. It was not way up, but he could tell it was up. He was trying to catch an actual reading on the monitor of his heart rate, but he was not able to before it came back down. He was calling because he is wondering if this was considered a severe allergic reaction. He got the vaccine and was able to walk to his car. His mouth got dry right after the vaccine within a minute or two and noticed his heart rate went up. Treatment: He took some deep breaths and drunk water and it got better. He drove home, but that at nighttime while sleeping he noticed his heart rate went up a couple of times, but then it came back down. He could not get a reading of heart rate right away. The highest he saw on the monitor that he was able to capture was 101 and then it came back down. He was not sure if this was because he was nervous. He just had a couple of episodes that night and then nothing again. He also experienced his arm being sore from the vaccination. However, he stated that is to be expected. He stated the arm sore started a few days after getting the COVID Vaccine and then it was gone. Stated he was calling because he was concerned because Pfizer said to report any issues. He started to feel better and added this may not even be an issue. He just got concerned. Mentioned he was not sure if real side effects or if he was over thinking things. Outcome of the events was resolved.

A 44-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at a single dose on the left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 28Dec2020. Since receiving the vaccine, he has experienced multiple side effects at varying time points: pain at injection site left shoulder (experienced pain first day of receiving vaccine on 28Dec2020 and couple of days after fever (unspecified date) resolved (on an unspecified date); he was currently experiencing intermittent minimal pain especially when he wakes up; feels something is different; fever (experienced 08Jan2021); fatigue (developed 07Jan2021). He went to the ER on 08Jan2021 when he developed fever, nausea and shortness of breath which also resolved that day. When he went to ER, his CRP was up a little at 1.1. His PCR and antigen test was negative at that time (08Jan2021); a retest of PCR done 5 days after sxs started (unclear of time window) was negative. He was concerned that he had the fever many days after the vaccine. HCP was asking if any cases of fever and fatigue reported after 7 days (around the 10 day mark) of receiving the first dose. He stated that he is planning on taking the second dose. The patient is a physician calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine. He received his first dose on 28Dec2020. He had a little bit of pain in his left arm on same day, but it went away. About 10 days later, 07Jan2021, he had fever and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, he went to the ER with a temp of 101. He had tachycardia, nausea and shortness of breath. He was not admitted, stated his fever was controlled and his breathing was better. His oxygen was 100% and everything was ok and he was sent home. In the ER he had xrays and labs and everything was ok, except his CRP was a bit up. In the ER he had an antigen and pcr covid test (08Jan2021) and they both came back negative. About 4 or 5 days after the symptoms started, he had an outpatient repeat pcr test and nucleic acid rapid test (unspecified dates) and they both came back negative. He is on his way to get his second dose and he is asking if the symptoms could be side effects from the vaccine. Outcome the event fever was recovered on an unspecified date. Outcome of nausea and shortness of breath was recovered on 08Jan2021, while outcome of pain at injection site left shoulder was recovered on 28Dec2020. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

He is currently a highway patrol officer. While driving in his patrol car, at 1035, he felt tightness in the back of his neck and tightness to his airway- he described it feeling like someone hit him in the neck.

The patient requested a chair to sit down and the Paramedic assisted the patient to do so. The patient expressed verbally to the Paramedic having a difficulty with needles and subsequently the patient lost consciousness while on the chair but maintaining a pulse and a hoarse respiration (snoring). Thereafter the patient was placed on a medical code in supine position with an immediate clearing of hoarse respiration. Evaluation by the Paramedic revealed an intact HEENT, (continued on page 2)...

The pain became worse over the next several days resulting in what I&#39;d describe as an electrical shock/burning feeling whenever I moved my left arm the wrong way (seemingly pinching the lymph nodes). I&#39;m currently on day 5 of the pain and it&#39;s still present although it has lessened on the 5th day. On the 2nd day the pain started to move down from the armpit closer to the pectoral.

A 44-years-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Feb2021 17:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at hospital. Medical history included coronary artery disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unknown date for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not have covid before vaccination. The patient experienced small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. These events were serious as life threatening, disability and requiring hospitalization from 21Feb2021 till 23Feb2021 at 14:00. On 20Feb2021 07:00 the patient experienced headache, chill, running nose, shortness of breath with outcome of recovering. The patient experienced also pains in chest on 21Feb2021 11:00 with outcome of recovering and injection location had redness, hardness on an unspecified date with outcome of recovering. Clinical course was as follows. 19Feb2021-5:45pm the patient went to receive vaccine shot. 20Feb2021 the patient had headache, chill, runny nose, and shortness of breath. 21Feb2021 11am still had shortness of breath and pains in chest. Went to clinic had a rapid Covid test come back negative, pain increased and he went to emergency room. The patient was admitted to the hospital with small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues. Inflammatory response seems to possibly triggered possible underlying issue of minor heart disease. Then induced heart attack and myocardial issue. The patient would gladly be admitted to a clinic for observation and testing to assist Pfizer in understanding this unfortunate situation. The injection location had redness, hardness. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment due to the event which included multiple lab tests, Angiogram, CR scan and pain medicine.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

The patient winced as the vaccine was being injected and said it was more painful than the last time he go it. He immediately stated he didn&#39;t feel well. I applied a little pressure to the injection site which he said made it feel better but he was starting to feel flushed and faint. I kept the patient in the chair and got him some water. He reported that he had experienced this before with vaccines but it had been a long time. He asked to lay on the floor so we got him into a prone position on the floor on his right side. He laid there for a few minutes then drank some more water and laid back down. After a few more minutes he was ready to sit up. He moved to a chair in our waiting area left when he felt well enough. I called patient 2 hours later to check on himand he reports he is doing fine.

                                                Would occasionally have difficulty catching my breath while not doing anything.  I occasionally felt my heart flutter or it would possibly skip a beat.  Mild chest pain below above the sternum but I get that feeling from my Eosinophilic Esophagitis.  I&#39;ve become more concerned recently as I almost fainted once on 5/19 while working at my computer.  I&#39;ve had two other instances of feeling faint, most recently occurring on 5/27.  I historically have had no heart issues and can ski and hike all day and feel great so this recent change has been concerning.  After reading articles on the covid vaccines I realized that my symptoms are similar to the heart related issues and took ibuprofen when I felt additional chest pressure.  That has helped to alleviate the pressure at least.

                                                1st shot 4/13, no issue with injection site. About a week later had trouble breathing, chest pain, felt like lungs were hurting in my back, weak, tired, couldn&#39;t catch my breath when i went upstairs and almost passed out. 2nd shot 5/04, felt pain at injection site (that was expected), that night started to get a bad headache and got worse and worse. Next morning, whole body aching, upper body, lower back, bad headache, Left underarm (lymph) swollen. 2nd day slight headache, neck ache, left underarm swollen. That night had rash on arms, chest, and stomach. 3rd day, nighttime rash arms, chest, stomach. Still red where band aid was over injection site. Over a week later still have redness shape of band aid, Seems I have sensitive skin since the 2nd covid shot. 10 days after 2nd shot I still have redness the shape of the Band Aid on my left arm. Got a red spot on my nose (looks like Rosacea). 4 weeks later, still have a red spot on my nose. I have itchiness between fingers left hand, on my face left side, neck, arms (left wrist, right arm in places) redness on chest, and rashes on back, left buttocks, and itchiness on legs. i noticed that it gets worse at night. As far as i know i did not get the Covid Virus, i did the rapid test and regular test and both were negative. But i was very sick with my stomach and had issues breathing in late 2019 and again early 2020, took medication (antibiotics) both times.   I had to write on this form over and over again kept getting frozen with error from the PDF. Even if I hit OK, it keeps popping up and does not let me finish, so I can imagine that lots of people gave up, like I may. Pfizer 4/13/2021 EW0162. After 5pm Pfizer 5/04/2021 EW0170. After 2pm

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Mar2021 at around 13:00 or 13:30 (at the age of 44 years old) (Lot Number: EP7534, unknown expiration) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020; sneezing and runny nose both on 21Mar2021. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient reported that he received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 22Mar2021. He felt fine after receiving the vaccine, but there was little bit rash on arms just afterwards and felt maybe a little restless but felt fine and went for a walk on 22Mar2021. As the night went on, he really noticed how sore his arm was/pain in his arm and when he was sleeping, he had trouble sleeping/problems with sleep (Mar2021) and felt movements in his chest at times (Mar2021). It felt like he had COVID all over again and had chills, soreness, and his smell was kind of gone in Mar2021. He was previously feeling pretty good. He had COVID-19 in Nov2020, and his symptoms feel very similar including loss of sense of smell but no coughing. He had a fever but that has gone away in Mar2021 and he did not take aspirin or anything for it. He also had fatigue, some swollen in lymph nodes, and his heart rate accelerated in Mar2021.  He had sneezing and runny nose the day prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient would like to know if his symptoms are related to the vaccine or if he possibly has COVID-19 again.  His symptoms are the same as COVID as far as what he can see, and his symptoms are really high. He would like to know if he can still receive the second dose of the vaccine if he has a positive COVID test after the first dose of the vaccine. The patient mentioned that there was very pretty high percentage of people having the symptoms after having the vaccine, kind of virus &#34;causing&#34;.  The patient asked if he needs to be tested to see if he had the virus before he was vaccinated and to know if these are one of the side effects or one of the symptoms of the virus, and to make sure that these are not actually corona virus. The patient recovered from fever in Mar2021, while unknown outcome for the remaining events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 45-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 06Jan2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure from Apr2020 and ongoing. Ongoing concomitant medication included lisinopril from Apr2020 for blood pressure/high blood pressure. The patient received the vaccine between 1:30-2:00pm yesterday afternoon (06Jan2021). He waited for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine and he was ok. Later, on 06Jan2021, he developed a rash on his forearm that went to both forearms. He already has high blood pressure and it was elevated after the vaccine. During the night he felt like he was warm inside. He took a low dose Bayer Aspirin. The outcome of the event rash and hypertension was not recovered, and the outcome of the event feeling hot was recovered on 07Jan2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

After the second dose, I found I have more frequent cardiac arrhythmia and now it is more frequent. Sometimes I also felt chest pain. As a scientist, I started to think about the possibilities. I think my current heart problem is associated with COVID-19 vaccine. It is possible antibodies raised against the spike protein generated from muscle cells cross-react with a protein in the heart and cause the problem. I am going to visit a family doctor or cardiologist to see what is going on in my heart.

I felt like my heart rate raised a couple of times a day. The spikes in my blood pressure and heart rate lasted about four days. It felt a little like an anxiety attack. I was prescribed a Diuretic which  I took for a week. When you got the second dose I did not have any of the same symptoms.

                                                Within 60 seconds of receiving the injection, I experienced moderate breathing difficulty.   After 10-20 minutes, I noticed that my throat felt slightly swollen (slight difficulty swallowing).  Due to a hyperallergic event that occurred about 12 years ago, I occasionally run into something that triggers the respiratory effect  - although usually the reaction is milder than that caused by the vaccine.  However, the throat swelling is new.  I took a single puff of an Albuterol inhaler around 5 minutes after the injection,  but it had no effect (usually the case for me when the cause is allergic in nature).  About 37 minutes after the injection, medical staff advised me to take an antihistamine.  I took approximately 6 mg of doxylamine succinate (orally).  However, by this point, the breathing had already started to ease slightly.  Approximately 30 minutes later, my breathing was back to normal and the throat inflamation was gone.  It&#39;s uncertain how much of that would have occurred through time alone and how much of it was the antihistamine starting to take effect.  My BP was very high when measured during treatment.  Partially explained by the albuterol inhaler combined with pseudoephedrine taken earlier in the day, along with anxiety and exertion from the event itself.

Unable to stand, had to crawl to nearby chair and call for wife. Thought might be dehydrated, extremely pale, tried to drink water, but began vomiting. BP was elevated, but no temperature. Tried to eat crackers and drink more water, but continued to violently vomit. Never felt so badly in entire life. No strength to stand or get up the stairs to be taken to ER, so had to call paramedics. When they arrived, BP had come down, but they felt needed to be transported to ER, so they took to healthcare facility at about 1:30 pm.

Was still feeling poor at 1am but coherent and talking, not thinking  that it was serious enough to warrant going to hospital, as he believed it was just a bad headache and the vomiting was from the headache.  At 6am, he was found blue/dead in his bed.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included chronic back pain, degenerative disc disease, and Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) colitis; the patient had no risk factors for cardiac disease other than obesity; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took cyclobenzaprine and pregabalin (LYRICA) and experienced allergies. It was unknown if the patient had other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Apr2021, 8 hours after the 2nd Pfizer vaccine was received, the patient developed chest pain with dyspnea. It was also reported that on 08Apr2021, troponin trended to 19; electrocardiogram (EKG) showed very subtle diffuse ST elevations; and the symptoms were consistent with myocarditis. All the adverse events (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit; an emergency room/department or urgent care; and hospitalization on an unspecified date for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included other/Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-at assay: negative on 10Apr2021 (post vaccination). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events, which included colchicine and ibuprofen. The patient was recovering from all the events.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Information provided was so limited to prevent a meaningful medical assessment. Other than a temporal association, there was no evidence or argument suggesting a causal relationship for BNT162B2 in the reported events, serious due to hospitalization. Otherwise, this patient did not show risk factors for cardiac disease, except for obesity. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The outcome of the event he was going to die, his body was shutting down, stroke/mini stroke, he couldn&#39;t move/loss of motor function/movements were off, head was very tingly, speech was not slurred but more like there was an impediment, loss of motor function including movement and speech/couldn&#39;t speak, have had some sort of off feeling in my head, occasionally worse than other days/feels like he has a really tight cap on his head, very tired, pounding headache in the back of his head constantly was not recovered, for the events digestive issues/digestive problems, eyes were real mucusy/first week mucous in my eyes/could be allergy was recovered on 01Apr2021, while for the rest of the events was unknown. Caller states he has an appointment with a neurologist and he&#39;s trying to get it moved up. Caller states his doctor wants to do a lumbar puncture to rule out MS or Parkinson&#39;s that sort of thing. Caller states but at this point they are trying to rule things out. Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

By 5/11 the petechiae developed into thrombocytopenia purpura with a platelet count fo 1000, including mouth lesions and prolonged mucosal bleeding. Admitted Hospital for treatment on 5/11. Treatment included a high dose of oral dexomethasone for four days, IVIG transfusion for two days, and a single platelet transfusion. Fluid developed in the lungs, but that was determined to be a byproduct of treatment, and not part of the adverse reaction. By the time of discharge on 5/14, platelet count had risen to 88000. One week later at outpatient, platelet count had risen to 180000.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

In the evening of the same day, around 7h30 PM while I was sitting on a table talking to my parents, I had a nosebleed, not very bad, just about 10 drops of blood. I had not had nosebleed for  8 or 10 years before that night. I thought it might be because of the dryness in my house, humidity dropped to 30%  from the normal range of 40%-60%. However, last night (Tuesday night) around the same time 7:00pm ~ 7:30pm, I had a nosebleed again while having dinner with my family, a bit less blood dropping this time, but it makes me worried a little bit.    Other than the nosebleed, I don&#39;t have any other symptoms, the soreness on the injection arm is close to nothing and I usually forgot about it.

As the days have gone on it?s gotten a little worse. Left under arm pain, armpit area, left chest (pectoral) pain. Just lingering pain. Very sensitive to the touch. I also developed a rash on the left side of my spine between the shoulder blades. It  showed up this past weekend or the end of last week. It?s more of a painful rash than itchy. It?s very uncomfortable to lean against or lay on.  This is all 13 days after the second shot. I have just been taking ibuprofen for the pain.  Going to see my doctor today.

                                                Within an hour of receiving the vaccine I felt a sharp pain shoot down the back of my knee to my heal. I continued to work with the pain.  The next day my knee and calf was sizeably larger.  I went to the urgent care on March 19, 2021.  Then to the Emergency room on March 20, 2021.  They performed an ultrasound of my leg and found a blood clot.  It is in a superficial vein.  Followed up with a vein doctor and will go again in three months for another follow up.

                                                On or about 0845 am, RN administered Covid vaccine (2nd one for patient). Attempted administration with syringe (a Haiou, 1ml, 23g, 1&#39;&#39;, Lot 20JC2, Exp: 10-17-25) resulted in needle going into patient&#39;s arm, but the 2 piece retractable distal needle and hub separated from the proximal tube part of the syringe resulting in COVID vaccine dose being lost. None of the 1st dose entered patient&#39;s arm. With needle and distal hub still fully immersed in patient&#39;s arm, RN removed it and held pressure on bleeding. RN informed patient that needle failed, to which pt stated he was &#34;shocked,&#34; and felt an &#34;electric&#34; sensation when needle was inserted. Patient tolerated well. Bleeding abated. RN administered a 2nd dose of vaccine to the patient with no problems on the same LUE, more medial by about 2 inches than the first attempt. Bandage applied to both sites due to scant bleeding. Patient tolerated well, but showed no emotion. Pt complied with all instructions, and RN thanked patient for coming in.

                                                Sore arm; Muscle cramps all over the body; Sugar was very high; Dehydrated; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 46-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 27Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack (at the age of 39) and had couple of stents (and the things done) later after that, and Lyme disease (past this Summer). The patient was taking several concomitant medications (unspecified). The patient&#39;s mother was calling for her son (patient) as he works out on the road, but he has had a heart attack at 39 years old and has had some other problems. The patient got his first Pfizer shot and about 2 to 3 days later while he was working, he first just had the sore arm on 03Mar2021. The patient worked in fiber glass repair on pools and it was very warm, and he started having muscle cramps all over the body on 03Mar2021. The patient ended up in the hospital on 03Mar2021 and his sugar was very high, and he was dehydrated. As treatment taken for the events, they gave him fluids through an IV and they gave him metformin medication 500 mg. The patient underwent laboratory tests and procedures (his doctor did the laboratory work), and they did laboratory work at the hospital where he went. It was clarified that they just did blood work on 03Mar2021, but the patient&#39;s mother didn&#39;t know what it was. The patient was just held for observation and was out the next day (04Mar2021). That was only the first shot, so the patient was really afraid to get the second shot one. The patient&#39;s mother told him she will try to find out something about it. patient&#39;s mother looked up the side effects and she did not see that as a side effect. At the time of reporting, the patient still had cramps once in a while. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Muscle cramps all over the body&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                a 46-year-old male with no known past medical history who initially presented complaining of headache and neck stiffness with onset the morning of 04/03/2021.  The patient states that his headache was initially gradual in onset and eventually decreased in severity on 4/5 however, on 04/06 after a day at the beach the patient developed a severe headache with rapid onset that he described as the worst headache in his life.  He did try to medicate himself at home with 600-800 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hr with minimal decrease in his headache pain.  As result he presented to  urgent care for initial evaluation who sent him to the emergency department for possible brain bleed.  On arrival to the emergency department the patient had a head CT which showed trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basilar cisterns likely due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm.  He was transferred to  for continued workup of the subarachnoid hemorrhage with CTA and possible IR intervention.  At time my evaluation patient was resting comfortably in the bed.  He continued to complain of severe headache and neck stiffness.  He additionally notes that light and loud sounds make his headache worse.  He denied any focal weakness, paresthesia&#39;s, numbness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or any other concerning neuro symptoms.  Patient was hypertensive during my evaluation despite being on a Cardene drip.  Patient&#39;s mother was at bedside and was able to assist with history.

                                                On March 25, 8 days after the vaccine shot in my left arm, I began experiencing intense pain on the left side of my neck and head. By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

                                                I experienced mild fatigue and chills about 12 hours after the shot.  No treatment necessary.  I woke up at approx. 1:30 am feeling very warm.  I got out of bed.  While in the bathroom, I began to feel very lightheaded and passed out while I was washing my hands.  My wife heard me crash to the floor.    I returned to consciousness but passed out again while trying to stand, unresponsive to my wife.  I returned to consciousness after about 1 minute.  I stayed sitting for several minutes while my wife brought me some water.  I felt thirsty and it&#39;s possible I was dehydrated, but I had been drinking fluids (water) the day before as normal.  Due to the two fainting spells and a possible head injury, I went to the Emergency Room for treatment at approx. 2 am.

This lasted approximately 15 minutes. 3 minutes after receiving a vaccine. He started to complaint about feeling nauseated. He started rapid heart rate which caused him to have hyperventilation and almost fainted. The episode last for 15 minutes and he just want to go and report it. Consumer confirmed it was the Pfizer Covid19 vaccine. The consumer wasn&#39;t still experiencing the side effects. They lasted to 5pm. I got my shot at 11am.

                                                nstemi; Myocarditis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 46-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 26Apr2021, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  The patient had no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive  any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 27Apr2021, the patient reported to the hospital with complaints of chest pain with electrocardiogram (EKG) showing non-diagnostic diffuse ST elevations and elevated cardiac biomarkers. On 27Apr2021, the patient experienced non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and myocarditis. The patient was hospitalized for one day. and the event required an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: negative on 02May2021, covid-19: negative on 02May2021, electrocardiogram: unknown showing non-diagnostic diffuse ST  elevations and elevated cardiac biomarkers, myocarditis: unknown. Cath report did not reveal coronary artery disease (CAD). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of NSTEMI (acute myocardial infarction), myocarditis (myocarditis), chest pain (chest pain), EKG showing non-diagnostic diffuse ST elevations and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The outcome of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), myocarditis, chest pain and electrocardiogram (EKG) showing non-diagnostic diffuse ST elevations and elevated cardiac biomarkers was recovered on an unknown date. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient was tested for COVID-19 on 02May2021 and was negative.   Information on lot number/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment of the case.  Based on currently known drug profile it is unlikely that events non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and myocarditis are related to BNT162B2. This case will be re-evaluated upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and investigators, as appropriate.

EKG showed no sign of heart attack and I was released from the emergency room after 3 hours of monitoring at which time the blood pressure normalized to 130/90. 12 hours after the injection I had pain at the injection, extreme full body aches, mild headache and slight nausea. All side effects were gone within 36 hours.

I did not feel as if I were having a heart attack, yet I experienced intense pain that was amplified when I would lie down - it was aggravated by even subtle movements.  Self guided research brought be to, &#34;Pericarditis,&#34; as a very plausible explanation as the symptoms mirrored online descriptions.  I did contact my primary care provider, however did not schedule an office visit as symptoms were manageable and improved across a period of several days.

Narrative:  12/21 employee received vaccine at 0930 - later in the afternoon he noted tachycardia to about 100. He was watching the rate on his Apple watch. The highest rate was 130. His only other symptom was fatigue which was bad enough on 12/22 that he had to go home. He saw his PCP on 12/22 for the tachycardia who ordered labs which were all normal. He is a resident so he asked anesthesia to do an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia. On 12/23 his heart rate average went down to 100. Today (12-28) his resting heart rate is 70-80 which is his baseline. He has not had recurrence of the tachycardia since 12/23. He also reports he had soreness at the injection site and myalgias both of which have since resolved.

                                                Approximately 13 hours after receiving the vaccine I became overwhelmingly tired. Went to get ready for bed by first going into the bathroom. While getting ready I passed out (micturation syncope). Hit my head on the floor and sustained a concussion. I am still experiencing post concussive symptoms but this is to be expected as it has been less than a week.

Pulse-oximetry applied revealed normal spO2, but tachycardia to 140bpm (this patient&#39;s resting HR is approximately 55-65).  Apple Watch data confirmed rapid increase in HR at that moment.

HR gradually recovered to normal levels within 30 minutes and patient was released after 60 min observation.  Patient reported generalized fatigue in weeks following injection.   Nineteen (19) days after injection, patient developed unprovoked resting tachycardia to approximately 180bpm (following some moderate weigh-lifting exercise).  Symptoms did no resolve sufficiently and patient was transported by EMS to ER for evaluation

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

This 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; borderline diabetes. Concomitant medications included losartan; alirocumab (PRALUENT, injection) on 20Jan2021. Since 23Jan2021, patient was dizzy all along and almost fainted and was still having symptoms of mild migraine and he don&#39;t know like some light sensitivity. Doctor believed it was from vaccine. Patient was wondering how long was this going to be last as he had second shot coming out. He didn&#39;t think it was an adverse reaction and he thought he should get the second shot. But this was continuing to me and it had already been two weeks and patient still having symptoms of mild migraine. Patient was worried about taking the second shot as a result. He had never had a migraine before and was told it was probably from the vaccine and that was not something he wanted to hear. Patient wanted to know if this was normal to still be having this side effect for this long. Patient was taking acetaminophen (for migraine), it was not a TYLENOL, it was from a different brand. Patient did liver and cholesterol test and blood test in Jan2021 at Cardiologist and they came back fine, nothing was found there. The outcome of event migraine was not resolved. The outcome of rest events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Waited 20-40 more minutes, then felt dizzy and began to have hives in addition to previous reactions. I went to Urgent Care where they took vitals. Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated, throat was abnormal, and I had hives. They gave me antihistamine and steroid shot.  After 30minutes - and hours, vitals returned to normal.

                                                I started having heart palpitations/irregular heartbeats  on the night of 03/23 until I fell asleep. I had a few heart palpitations on 03/24 during the day and when I laid down for sleep my heart palpitations were non stop all night. It felt like every few minutes my heart would stop, then flutter, them resume normal beating. This was the worst episode This lasted all night until the morning, after I got a little sleep. Since 03/25 the episodes are getting fewer but still linger.

                                                Got my first Pfizer shot on March 24 at 2 pm. The first day I felt way off like I was drunk or on some kind of drug that gets you high with bouts of dizziness and some major hypertension. My back and chest were very tight the whole time. The tension finally subsided around 11 pm that night but I was still uneasy. The 2nd day I felt ok in the morning and throughout the day until about 3 or 4 pm I started getting really nauseated and tired. I went to lay down to sleep and felt a little better when I woke an hour later. Day 3 I started feeling extremely tired and fatigued with some major chills. Basically slept most of that evening and throughout the night. Woke that next day and couldn&#39;t get that dizzy foggy feeling out of my head the whole day. Day 4-5 still bouts of dizziness, chills and fatigue with some nausea also I noticed I developed a wheezing dry cough which points towards respiratory distress. Day 6 still feeling yucky, tired, fatigued, some nausea and that dam cough. Today  03-31-21, still feeling weak and tired with some episodes of dizzy spells, nausea and respiratory distress cough.   Also forgot to mention on day 2 and 3 I had some major tingling on the right side of my head for most of the day. Felt like spiders crawling on my head and face. The last time I felt tingling like that I got shingles which also got me very sick and put me in the ER and ICU years ago. So there is also some post traumatic stress from that as well.  Made an appointment to see a Doctor on 03-30-21 to have my blood pressure checked and get an overall check up.  My blood pressure is elevated and stress levels are high with anxiety.  Dr prescribed me some anxiety medication. No other recommendations from the Doctor.

His blood pressure was very elevated in the systolic 170 range and he did require some IV labetalol.  The patient states he really has not missed any doses of his medications.

Heart rate started to decrease after 10 minutes and returned to normal within 30-40 minutes.  Numb areas returned to normal within 45-60 minutes.  Slight feeling of anxiety for several hours, but this could have been simply from stress from the initial reaction.  I also occasionally have random panic attacks and could have potentially had a small one at the onset of my face going numb which could have contributed to the length of unease.

                                                Difficulty operating a motor vehicle at speeds over about 45 mph. I drove to the first vaccination appointment that morning (3/2/2021) and everything was fine. Driving home from the jab I started to experience trouble driving my car when crossing a major bridge in Pittsburgh. The feeling was akin to the anticipatory feeling of being on a climbing roller coaster or drop ride in an amusement park. Elevated heart rate; disorientation and a sort of adrenaline like rush. The feeling returns every time I attempt to drive on a freeway/bridge/etc though local driving is fine. (I was driven to the 2nd jab.) The issue continues now, close to 2 months after it began 45 minutes after receiving the 1st jab. In the several months prior to the jab I was driving extensively with no issues.

This happened about three days after my first dose for about 4 days. Starting to feel better now though. I didn&#39;t know what was happening and was tempted to go to the emergency room a couple of times but didn&#39;t. I&#39;m just finding out about this from an article I&#39;m just reading about 30 minutes ago and thought I should report this. I&#39;ve only had my first dose and now I&#39;m very concerned about the second due June 22nd.

The BP was 179/91. Heart rate has also been high and this morning BP was 150/71. Patient was send home from work and he was feeling that from two days after he got the shot but it&#39;s been couple of days ago. The patient went in upstairs and then was sent to medical to that they said his face was red, &#34;I didn&#39;t look like, look good&#34; and took blood pressure and it was 179/91 and patient was sent home and told to stay home today (06May2021). Patient called his doctor and he said &#39;it would be risky&#39; for a couple of days. This morning my blood pressure has come down some but it was still high, it wasn&#39;t near high as it was, run like 129, 130 over 58 or some like that and this morning it was still 150 over 70 over 69 which is quite high.

He did not take it within 7 days of taking the shot because he was told not to take it within 7 days of taking the shot, so he got off the medicine for the shot. The patient went for one actually two weeks ago or three weeks ago for his heart checkup and all that stuff, everything was fine, cholesterol was fine, everything was good.

I left the hospital, start driving, and suddenly felt that my right arm was heavy, numb, with a tingling sensation. I stopped the car and called the nurse and I was told that it will go away, and I can take a tylenol/motrin. It improved over the next hour and I felt it resolved a few days later but then it returned on 1/18 but not to the same extent, and I also felt intermittent tingling and numbing in my right foot. I also experienced intermittent episodes of fast heartbeats and missing heartbeats since the vaccine almost daily. I was fatigued and extremely thirsty for 3 days but that resolved completely.

But every time I was stable and tried to use it again I felt pain again. Pain was always there - it was tolerable. I was told to take Ibuprofen about three hours later. Second day,  I could feel it but I didn&#39;t take medication. It slowly went away. No swelling, nothing. On January 4th started having symptoms nose bleeding; diarrhea; cold sweats; had a fever - but I didn&#39;t take it to know what it was. I very tired/ extremely sleepy; my eyes started feeling warm- these symptoms creeped up on me. It started around 10:00 am and within an hour an a half I had to tell my boss and they told me to leave work - but I couldn&#39;t drive. I stayed in my car and just slept and I was extremely tired. I had a coworker keep an eye on my because I looked really bad. I slept two or three hours in my car. I was still tired and I couldn&#39;t drive yet. So I stayed in my car a little longer until I felt stronger and drove home. I had started coughing and knocked out - but I was beginning to coughing a lot  on drive home- the  first hour I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was coughing so much - lasted an hour. Chest coldness for a couple of days - cold chest. It wasn&#39;t tight. Next day,  January 5, 2021 - went to doctor and they ordered COVID test. Dr thought I had a stomach virus. Diarrhea continued for two days. Weak and fatigue for 5 days. My Fever - temperature was on the first day was one day only. Second day, I did have a lot of fatigue and I was coughing a lot.  The fatigue lasted 10 days.

                                                I awoke from sleep freezing cold.  Colder than I have ever felt.  violent shakes.  So much that I was worried my muscles would begin to sieze up and cramp.  I had warm clothes and 5 blankets and could not get warm for over 2 hours.  Elevated heart rate and breathing.  Nothing warmed me.  Eventually (and with ibuprofen) the incident subsided.  I felt weak and just &#34;off&#34; with slight body aces and fatigue for the next day and a half.

Felt fine Monday morning. Monday about 11 am began to feel tightness in chest, thought it was bad heartburn. Pain kept me awake Monday night, and continued into Tuesday morning. Called the doctor, was sent to urgent care. Urgent care detected elevated tritonin and had me transported to the emergency room. Elevated heart rate and rising tritonin levels had me admitted to the hospital. Given heperin and a beta-blocker, given a CT scan, and monitored over night. On Wednesday had a echocardiogram and then a heart catherter and imaging, which showed a healthy heart, no plaque, no blockages. Tritonin levels and heart rate returned to normal. Released from hospital on evening of 3/10.

                                                I recently began monitoring my blood pressure at home with an Omron Platinum series monitor. On the morning of Wednesday, April 7, I received a reading of an irregular heartbeat. I also received a reading of an irregular heartbeat on the evening of April 7, the morning of April 8, the evening of April 8, and the evening of April 9. I reported this information to my doctor who suggested I wear a Holter monitor for 48 hours to see if I had any issues with my heart. The result of the Holter monitor showed that I am having PVCs less than 1% of the time. Since I got so many readings of irregular heartbeat in a short amount of time on my monitor, I thought the irregular heartbeats may be related to the vaccine which was administered the afternoon before I began getting the irregular heartbeat notifications.

                                                The night after my first shot, I felt pressure on my lungs, It felt as if I had the onset of Pleurisy as I have had that issue in the past.  I figure I would wait to get it treated as it is not always picked up in the x-ray in its infant stages (based on past experience).  On March 2, the pain became unbearable and I went into a urgent care center to get an x-ray and something to help with my issue.  The urgent care did not take my x-ray they immediately sent me to the hospital strongly intimating that the problem was probably more serious than I thought.  I was in the emergency room, they ran tests and made me comfortable enough as they also gave me a ct-scan which is when they found the bi-lateral pulmonary embolisms.  I have since gone to my primary care physician and he directed me to a hematologist/oncologist.  The event was found to be unprovoked.  I am on blood thinners for 6 months.

I asked him if he is ok and if I can call 911. He said he is fine . He was helped to sit on the chair. He was wearing a black mask and seating. I asked him if he wants to me to call 911. He said he is feeling better. There was blood dripping out the mask. I asked him to check . His lips were split and his mouth was bloody. He fell flat on his face, that resulted in the bloody mouth. I gave him a ice pack and sat next to him . He called his wife and waited in the same area. I sat next to him. His wife came in and took him to the immediate care .

                                                Please note that I am the patient in question here, but also an physician, so I will write this in technical terms as best as I understand what happened.  For background, my cardiac history is important. I had a work-up for palpitations performed more than a year ago that revealed normal cardiac function (EF &gt; 65% by NM myocardial perfusion study), normal coronary arteries, and significant exercise tolerance (I maxed out the treadmill test).  Usuallly I have to engage in vigorous exercise to raise my heart rate &gt; 160 bpm. My resting heart rate is typically in the 50s or less.   On Jan 15, 2021 I had an elective cerebral angiography and embolization procedure performed. I was asymptomatic prior to this procedure.  The procedure requires general anesthesia for several hours.  I have had the procedure conducted a few months previously and it typically has an unremarkable recovery, one night required in the hospital.   After the procedure and following extubation, I had hypoxia on room air, tachycardia, wheezing and fatigue.  The working cause for this was suspected atelectasis due to general anesthesia and I was given bronchodilators.  While my breathing improved overnight, I was very tachycardic even while sleeping ? pulse greater than 130.  Overnight telemetry noted arrhythmias with sinus tachycardia.   The tachycardia persisted long after prior albuterol use so I had CTA chest on 1/16.  No PTE was noted, though some basilar atelectasis and mild upper lobe ground glass opacities.  I was discharged but due to continued mild hypoxia overnight, low grade fever (&lt; 101F), and persistent tachycardia with any movement, I went to the ED on 1/17 for additional evaluation.   In the ED, I had tachycardia with arrhythmias noted (rate up to 160). Sinoatrial exit block noted on EKG and telemetry.  COVID-19 testing was negative by nasopharyngeal PCR and antigen testing.  Resting heart rate was &gt; 90 even when sleeping.   Follow-up echocardiogram on 1/21/21 revealed depressed ejection fraction (40-45%).  Cardia MRI on 2/1 was performed to evaluate for cardiomyopathy.  Symptoms at this point were fatigue, dyspnea with even mild activity (e.g. walking), and tachycardia  &gt; 140 bpm with even just walking.  My resting heart rate improved to 40s-50s.  It showed normal wall motion and ventricle size with slightly reduced ejection fraction. Cardiology recommended cardiac event monitoring which I wore for 28 days. It only revealed sinus tachycardia and bradycardia.   I still don?t feel great but able to do more physically than a couple of months ago.  I await further f/u cardiac imaging to see if there has been improvement in the heart function.

I was not under any stress, have never had anything like this occur, was not doing anything strenuous and all of a sudden had what I thought might even be a stroke or heart attack. I walked back to the house and took BP and it was 172/75 and pulse rate was only 64...but I was sweating, faint feeling, blurred vision, completely exhausted and it felt like my heart was pounding...but it wasn?t.??  I took BP multiple times but it was fine.  Just a really strange anxiety attack I guess that lasted a few hours.  I wasn?t worried about it and was t going to report it but have had 3 other people who unsolicited told me about their anxiety attack between 5 -7 days after shots. Two were phizer and one was Modena. Figured I would report it in case it helped someone else to not panic if they had an event like this.  It was quite scary and I don?t get worried about things like that!

Her symptoms improved throughout the night. She went home on Christmas morning and went to bed.  She woke up at around 5:00 p.m. She had swelling of her eyelids and an urticarial rash across her face and chest. She did have some mild throat itching.

                                                Background, I had Covid back at the end of May/beginning of June with 1 week of constant fevers (with 500mg tylenol q6), shortness of breath, fatigue, but no real cough. O2 sats somtimes in low 90&#39;s . I am one of the radiology faculty at the hospital I work at. Received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday Dec 18 at about 21:30. After the injection, I had moderate pain at the site of injection about 6 hours later, not unexpected. However, the next evening, I was feeling fatigued and went to bed at about 7 p.m. For the next three hours, I felt chills and finally at about 10 p.m. I took my temp after I felt that my fever had &#34;broke&#34; and temp was 101.9. Used a finger pulse ox just to make sure sats were ok, they were at 97%, but unexpectedly, resting heart rate was 130 bpm. I took some tylenol and called the ER, and they suggested calling the covid hotline pager and coming in if I did not improve. I called the hotline pager, and we discussed things and eventually decided that I should go to the ER as temp remained at 101.6. By the time I reached the ER, my temp was down to 100.8, but pulse still 122 (EKG with no other abnormalities) and BP was 165/100. I had no other symptoms to account another infection. Over the next two hours, vitals became more normal with HR down to 95 to 100, and BP down to 145/85 or so without any other intervention.  Sunday, still with some mild low grade temps of 99.8, but heart rate at 85 to 90 (I&#39;m usually at about 80).   In the ER, we came to the conclusion that my body mounted a significant immune response to the production of antigens after processing the mRNA given the lack of alternative diagnosis and the improvement of sx without any other intervention besides the 500 mg of tylenol I took before coming in.

Denies any allergies but did states she has history of low potassium and has had issues with medications nad vaccines in the past.  However no sx like this but does get &#34;a little loopy&#34; even when taking motrin. Instructed her to notify any provider prior to any vaccinations of the above sx. If I would have know any off this I would have highly recommended her to get authorization from her PCP prior

That night fatigue got worse but headache improved.  Went to bed at 9pm and had severe chills and shaking, heart was beating fast.  Chills lasted for several hours.  Increased heart rate all night and could not sleep at all.  Fitful night sleep and started to sweat in the Early morning.  Woke up for work at 5:30 am and had headache, dizziness, and flu-like symptoms with joint and muscle aches.  Had sweats all day today.  Went home early from work and slept from 9:30 am to 4:30 pm.  Most symptoms improved now but feel like I still have a fever and sweats.

A 49-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported) via unspecified route of administration in the arm right on 21Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced drug allergy; also received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number: EJ1685) via unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Dec2020 14:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: clinic. It was reported that on 23Jan2021, couple of days after the second shot, patient experienced skin on hands and the bottom of my feet started to peel off and bleeding and very painful in the fingers and the feet.  The events resulted in both: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, and Emergency room/department or urgent care. It was unknown if treatment received for the events. Outcome of all events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship and known drug profile, a contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded in the development of bleeding, skin exfoliation and pain in extremity.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Moments later, heart rate elevated north of 190 bpm and blood pressure went up to approx 180/100. Developed dry mouth (was very thirsty) and shaking/chills. Took about 60 minutes to stabilize. Went to ER for evaluation and tests around 2:30P. Received a liter of fluid. Both EKG and Bloodwork was indicated as normal. Released from hospital around 6P. Slept through most of the night.   3/26: heart rate was erratic all day. Would race and then stabilize throughout the day/night. Extremely lethargic. No trouble breathing (was able to breathe and take deep breathes) but took effort to breathe.  3/27: 1:40A woke up heart began racing at close to 200 bpm. Dry mouth, shakes. Similar to what I experienced immediately following the vaccine shot. Went to ER out of precaution. Symptoms stabilized after about an hour. Hospital did EKG, blood work and chest X-ray. all were normal, lungs were clear. However, glucose and bilirubin were both slightly elevated.  3/29: Still feeling lethargic. Heart rate has stabilized some but is still erratic. It  easily increases from simply walking around the house (much more than usual).   3/30: Scheduled appointment with primary care physician 3/31: Scheduled appointment with cardialogist

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Dose 1) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 20Mar2021 18:15 (batch/lot number: ER2613 and expiry date unknown) at 49 years old at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at the Hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history included obesity from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient had no previous heart issues and had no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications or other medications in two weeks of vaccination.

The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 21Mar2021, 12:00 am, patient went into atrial fibrillation with a high heart rate up to 160 bpm. It was reported that the heightened heart rate started on evening after the vaccine (on 20Mar2021), it topped out at a resting heart rate of over 160 bpm. Patient went to a primary health care physician, he did EKG (results unknown), then ordered patient to Emergency Room (Hospital name). The patient was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation with RVR. The patient was prescribed Apixaban (Eliquis) 5 mg oral tablet, 1 tab 2 times a day and Metoprolol (metoprolol succinate 50 mg extended release) 50 mg 1 cap per day. Patient was also given Diltiazem 10 mg via IV push while at the hospital. It was reported that patient continued to have increased heart rate and have not returned to a normal sinus rhythm as of 23Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included EKG: unknown result on Mar2021; heart rate: heightened (topped out at a resting heart rate of over 160 bpm ) on 20Mar2021, up to 160 (high /bpm) on 21Mar2021 and heart rate: continued to have increased on 23Mar2021; and sinus rhythm: have not returned to normal  on 23Mar2021.

                                                I went with my wife, whom we were more concerned about possible reactions to the vaccine given her history of anaphylaxis reactions to bee and wasp stings, has had to carry a Epi-pen always, so we stayed an additional 15 minutes for 30 minutes total before we left.  She was completely fine throughout, I however as we were walking out I began to feel a little ?Off?, not necessarily nauseous or dizzy, just a bit Off.  Told my wife that and that I wasn?t sure I should drive us home (I drove us there), so she drove.  About 15-20 minutes into the drive, it got worse and I passed out.  My wife says my eyes rolled in the back of my head with my eyes open but no responsive.  She says she kept hitting my chest but I didn?t respond. I came to about 2 minutes after passing out.  She asked me if I felt like I needed to goto the hospital, I told her I needed to eat, that I felt like what I needed was food, then we go from there.  I did eat breakfast, an English muffin at about 8am that morning, it was almost 12:30 by that point.  When I finally got food in me I felt much better and have had no adverse reactions since.

                                                I counselled the patient prior to giving him the Pfizer Covid19 vaccine.  He received the vaccine at 10:10am.  During the 15 minute observation period, one of my technicians was standing next to him talking to another patient.  She saw some papers slip out of patient&#39;s hand and noticed he was unresponsive when she tried to talk to him.  She yelled out for help and I ran out and saw his head rolled back, eyes open, and he sounded like he was snoring.  He never left the chair--just his head rolled back.  We tried to rouse him awake and I had my other technician call 911.  I also called for a store manager.  The patient came to about 15-30 seconds later.  I asked him his name, what day it was, and if he knew where he was.   He answered all questions correctly.  He told me that he&#39;s fainted before after vaccines, however he never disclosed this to me prior to the vaccine and had answered &#34;no&#34; under the question if you&#39;ve ever had a serious reaction to the vaccine.  We gave him some water and a cold paper towel.  The paramedics came and evaluated him.  He declined to go to the hospital and his wife came and picked him up.

He went for a heart cath yesterday and CABG this morning. Per the cath report his LAD was occluded.  I believe he was more aware of his symptoms after receiving the vaccine and that is why he finally came in.

                                                The evening of the shot my body basically turned on itself and began an all out mission to rid the vaccine.  Of course, that couldn&#39;t happen, but my body was going to proceed until I was dead or recovering.  I began having severe chills, roasting heat flashes, headache, and body ache.  Every sweat gland turned on full blast and did not turn off.  I began to vomit in outrageous fashion.  As violent as I&#39;ve ever experienced.  I had &#34;sessions&#34; of vomiting at least thirty times from Thurs night to Monday afternoon.  When I could get out of the bathroom, I would collapse back into my sweat soaked bed.  I would have an awful time trying to catch my breath.  It would be up to ten minutes of hyperventilating and racing pulse, until it would suddenly normalize.  And then I&#39;d be utterly exhausted and slip into some kind of semi-sleep coma.  This would not last even an hour before I&#39;d be racing to the bathroom again.  This was the first sixty hours.  Vomit. Hyperventilate. Wish for death.  Sleep coma. Repeat.  About 24 hrs in I added severe diarrhea that was a part of every bathroom journey from then on.  Ate nothing.  Couldn&#39;t take normal meds.  Sipped some pedialite.  Late Sunday I turned a corner and felt like I wouldn&#39;t die.  Took a full seven days for me to get any energy back and feel human again.- Every single symptom besides headache, was the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced.

A 49-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199 and expiration date not provided) intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 16Mar2021 13:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has no relevant medical history. Family history included diabetes (mother). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200 and expiration date not provided) Injected intramuscularly in left upper arm on 23Feb2021, 13:30 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced DVT symptoms, soft tissue injury, muscle pull and ankle strain. The patient experienced DVT left lower extremity and bilateral pulmonary emboli on 23Apr2021. The patient called regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He had adverse events to report. He has a DVT on his left calf, which he later clarified was left lower extremity. He is currently on double dose of apixaban (ELIQUIS) since Friday. He finally went and got it looked at. He is still being treated and will be seeing a hematologist. He stated that DVT symptoms occurred after first dose and was undiagnosed. He treated it as soft tissue injury and thought it was a muscle pull and ankle strain. Eliquis was started on 23Apr2021 and dose is 5 mg. He is taking two tablets twice daily for 7 days and then 1, 5mg tablet bid (twice a day) as well. No emergency room or physician&#39;s office required but Urgent care facility was visited on 23Apr2021. During this visit, they did Lab work, D Dimer results 1590 on 23Apr2021; Venous Doppler resulted in positive DVT in Left Lower Extremity. Chest CT resulted in positive peripheral defects in small branches of the lower lobes bilaterally, left greater than right, consistent with Pulmonary Emboli. Left sided pleural effusion and left basillary infiltrate, possibly atelectasis or developing infarct. Few pleural based nodular densities at right lung base, again atelectasis versus developing infarcts. The rest just states what was normal. Eliquis was prescribed on 23Apr2021, 5 mg two tablets twice daily for 7 days, then regular dose times 7 days. He is to report to hematologist on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the events deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was unknown. The reporter assessed the events as serious (life-threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events DVT of legs and Pulmonary embolism cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He had his first dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer) on 4/23, and his symptoms began on 4/29. He was itchy all over, but when he developed fever and SOB he came to the ER on 5/2 and was discharged on prednisone. His symptoms continued and so he came back to the ER and was admitted. He had a lymph node biopsy to rule out lymphoma (pathology returned negative for lymphoma). He was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and doxycycline. He tested &#43; for EBV IGG but not IGM. EBV PCR was pending upon discharge. He had a borderline positive lyme serology. He was discharged on doxycycline and steroids with improved symptoms. He returned to the ER with again worsening SOB, night sweats, worsening rash, recurrence of fever. He denies sore throat or any sick contacts. He reports a normal appetite. He was found to be hypotensive and in AKI.

Symptoms worsened and he was admitted to ICU on May 21st via the ED for multiorgan failure including respiratory failure with R pneumonia, Shock, Renal failure, Disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock liver failure requiring invasive vent support and treatment for septic shock including vasopressor support and antibiotic therapy.  He was started on CRRT on the 22nd.  His INR continues to rise and Hb dropping consistent with worsening DIC.  Blood cultures are positive for MRSA.  He will likely die from progressive septic shock and MSOF.

                                                Patient was given the second dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine on 6/2/21 at 12:29pm and was asked to wait for 15 minutes to watch how the patient reacts with the vaccine. He didn&#39;t have any side effect on his first dose. After 3 minutes of getting the vaccine, his wife notified me that she needs assistance. He was sweating profusely and was about to lose consciousness. His wife and I kept saying his name to check his response. He could not response or was about to faint. His pulse is slow, and his face is red. Since there was other customers waiting for shots in the clinic, I asked the technician to ask for pharmacy manager assistance. He came in the clinic, and checked patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure. The blood pressure was high (170/89). We checked his blood pressure again, and it was lower after couple minutes. Patient started to have consciousness and understand what we are talking. He told us that he always had the same reaction after getting his blood drawn. We asked him to sit down and was monitored by us in the clinic. After 30 minutes, he said that he was feeling fine without any problems and decided to leave. He can breathe ok and didn&#39;t have any adverse reactions such as swelling of throat and lip or hives. His wife and he didn&#39;t eat anything before getting the vaccine. I checked his blood pressure again, and it was 130/80. Will follow up on him this evening and tomorrow.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via unspecified route on right shoulder single dose for COVID-19 immunization; second dose with lot number: EV10161 on 22Apr2021, first dose with lot number: EP7533 on 01Apr2021, at 49-year-old. Medical history and concomitant medication were not reported. The patient was non-smoker, non-drinker. The patient had a little headache with the second shot but 2 weeks later on 03May2021 started having chills every night and would sweat. He was having chills and hot flashes and stomach was cramping and when inhaled like taking a deep breath, felt pressure in his back almost like pneumonia like lungs were filling with fluid or clotting. On the 07May2021, he took a little flu medication Theraflu over the counter (treatment) thinking that&#39;d clear it up. Every time he took a deep breath, it&#39;d just hurt right below my chest and in stomach and skin became extremely prickly. He&#39;d have like a low-grade fever like 99. This was 2 weeks after the second shot, so he went to the ER on 07May2021 and was given a COVID test, a fluid test and lab work trying and figure what he was having. One of his blood test - Dimer test showed kind of high levels with mainly blood clot so they gave him a CT scan, scan showed no blood clots, no kidneys stones or anything like that should had any sweating. ER doctor gave him an antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) for infection like diverticulitis or diverticulosis. The doctor said the patient did not have a stomach infection, his tests showing such high levels for clots so the doctor did more lab work a PRC, CRT, TRP or CPR, a CRT lab work and some fiber or Fibrogen which was for thickening of blood. Those numbers are supposed to be between 400 and 420, his was 879 today (17May2021). The patient did have COVID, it was positive COVID antigen test, I got those results today (17May2021). Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

After the dose was administered the patient experienced tachycardia (pulse 110), elevated BP (measured with arm cuff at ~180/120), headache, and warmth. The patient was offered a cold pack, given water, and was taken away to a secluded room to relax under supervision. After about 1.5 hours the patient improved (BP 120/76 and pulse 85). The patient informed me that his rheumatologist recently had him stop his treatments for Crohn&#39;s disease in preparation to receive the vaccine. He stated that he had similar symptoms before when trying different treatment regimens for his underlying condition. The patient left on his own and no further adverse effects were reported.

Approximately 5-7 minutes post injection experienced onset of difficulty swallowing and rapid heartbeat.  10-12 minutes post injection sensation of throat closing with some difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing increased.   15-17 minutes post injection, paramedics arrived.  Blood pressure was 169/113.  Dizzy upon standing.  20 minutes post injection paramedics administered 50mg Benadryl  due to difficulty swallowing and sensation of throat closing however it wasn?t worsening.  Paramedic asked me to rate the swallowing difficulty (1-10) which was a 5-6 but never exceeded that.  Transported to Emergency Room.

                                                Every since getting my vaccine I have been having these symptoms.  I received my first dose of phizer on 1/22/21 and a second dose 21 days later but was given Moderna not phizer.  I continue to have headaches on and off all day, they are short but intense lasting about 5-10 minutes, sometimes hour or two between.  Also shortness of breath and increased heart rate with just slight activity.  Going up a flight of stairs my heart rate will quickly increase to 130-140  BPM which has never happened before.  I have a fitness tracker on my watch so I watch it closely every day and it was never that high.  My heart rate will recover fairly quick if I sit and it will come down to 80-90 BPM, at night when relaxed for a while the lowest I see it is about 70-75 BPM, sleeping it will be around 65 bpm.

The clinical outcome of the events Heart palpitations and chills was recovered on 11Mar2021, the outcome of the event face started to clench a little was recovered on 03Mar2021.

Injection site pain - feels like been punched in arm. Headache in the evening. Night chills and complained of &#34;tight&#34; (not acute) chest pain... but no breathing problems. Morning fever of 101F. Headache, Dizzy, Fatigue, Muscle Pain (esp in legs, asif he had &#34;run a marathon&#34;). He spent most of the day &#34;resting&#34;.  Evening on day two, we noticed a large bump under his vaccinated arm. Radius about 5cm - larger than what I know swollen lymph nodes to look like - almost looks like a bicep between his armpit and nipple. Tender to touch. Morning of day three (48 hours after vaccine) bump under his arm remains and all other symptoms seem milder.

I got in my house and told my wife I was not feeling right and started to notice a dizziness coming on. I was to call the pharmacy to find out what I should do, but noticed my heart rate was up, I looked at my Apple watch monitor and my BPM was 164. I felt flush and told my wife to call 911. Ambulance arrived and took my vitals and ( I do not recall the blood pressure, but it was high for me) when they put me into the ambulance I began to shake uncontrollably and then began to sweat profusely. They took me to the emergency room, but did not administer any drugs. The Dr. came in and said he did not think it was related to the vaccine, but my personal Dr. agreed with me based on my medical history that it had to be related to the vaccine. My resting heart rate (I monitor this daily) is between 45 - 60 and my last blood pressure reading at my yearly physical on April 2nd, 2021 was 100/70.

Symptoms tapered off over 3-5 days. Similar experience with 2nd vaccine but less pronounced with a shorter timeframe, tapering off after 2-3 days. Strongest side effects after first vaccine, symptoms did not become noticeable until a couple of hours after it was administered, increasing next 24 hours before lessening over time. Basically identical to long covid symptoms but lasting only for a few days after vaccinations and not before.

I sat at the end of my bed and then do not remember anything until my head hit the bathroom floor.  My wife said i stumbled across the bedroom into the bathroom and it looked as if i just passed out and fell to the ground.

                                                I received the Pfizer vaccine on 21 December 2021.  On December 27 I developed a fever, cough and was diagnosed with Covid-19.  About 14 days later I started to get a rash on hands and feet with burning sensation.  I was evaluated and diagnosed with Covid toes.  About 1 week later I developed a fever and was evaluated and diagnosed with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and a DVT.  I continue to get worse to include arthritis in hands, wrists, feet and ankles.  I was admitted to the hospital with worsening pneumonia, reactive arthritis and a rash on elbows, knees, hands and feet.  I was in the hospital for about 5 days.  I have been evaluated by rheumatology, pulmonary and dermatology since.  The ongoing theory is I have a reactive arthritis from COVID and may have developed psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis.

                                                On April 1, 2021, I received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine at the Center and the only side effect from the vaccine at that time was localized soreness at the injection site of my left shoulder.   On April 2, 2021, earlier that day the soreness at the injection site began to dissipate after doing push-ups and massaging my left arm. After going to bed last night and that night is when the additional side effects started.  I was awakened by itching on both arms which had formed whelps from my shoulder to my forearm.   For the next 13 days, the whelps and itching were sparsely during the day (which had consumed my legs, upper torso as well as arms) as they presented the illusion to be getting better but would flare up at night while sleeping. I attempted to do home remedies from Calamine lotion, Benadryl and cold showers but nothing seemed to effectively work against the itching and the whelps that resembled Hives.    On April 13, 2021, while at work a new side affect began which was the swelling of my bottom lip (particularly the right half) along with itching in my throat.  The swelling reduced itself as I continued to work through the night but the discomfort in my throat continued. The whelps and itching were still sparsely present as well.   On April 14, 2021, later that morning, post work, the reduced swelling of my lower lip and throat discomfort I decided to go to the ER. While enroute to the ER, my top lip began to tingle and swell. These events made me more concerned about the severity I was experiencing since receiving the vaccine.   After checking into the ER and being triaged, the doctor informed me that I would be hospitalized overnight due to the swelling of my upper lip, elongated tonsils, elevated blood pressure and the diagnosis of whelps as Hives. For the next three nights I was intravenous administered Epinephrine, Benadryl and Prednisone.   On April 16, 2021, the third night I was discharged from the hospital with the same medications and informed to follow up with an allergist.

                                                Presented to ED today with complaint of right-sided CP onset yesterday. Patient has history of renal cell carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver.  He has had recurrent pleural effusions involving the right lung.  Has worsened pain with breathing. Had a R tube placed due to pleural effusion and last week when the tape was taken off it pulled and caused pain. Endorses SOB. No significant cardiac history. No h/o DVT, PE. Has renal CA and had L kidney removed. Patient admitted. Pulmonary/critical care was consulted regarding Pleurx catheter.  It is felt that his pleural effusion had decreased in size, and the catheter was likely contributing to his right-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Catheter is removed with good results of his pain.  Patient however did have recurrent fevers.  Empirically placed on Rocephin.  With this, he did improve. He was discharged in stable condition.

This was followed by 2 weeks of regular PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s noted by my self. This did not seem to be related to any kind of anxiety since I have never had anxiety problems.   I eventually had an echo cardiogram on  03/30/2021 which resulted as normal I also wore a Ziopatch for 2 weeks from 03/30/2021 which resulted as normal. By the time I was able to be tested most of my symptoms had resolved.

It lasted throughout the night.  I have had an arrhythmia sporadically in my past, but I don&#39;t recall it ever being this pronounced or sustained.  I had the same exact thing happen 12 days after a positive COVID test in which I exhibited mild symptoms.

Symptoms lasted a few minutes.  By the time I was evaluated at the emergency department a few minutes later I was feeling much better.  I did not need to take any medications.  7 hours later I began experiencing itching all over my body however, I never developed a rash.  My heart rate slightly increased.  Simply did not feel well.  Symptoms lasted a few minutes and again resolved without having to take any medications.

                                                After receiving vaccination, I started experiencing intermittent bouts of anxiety, rapid heart rate, sleeplessness and &#34;dark thoughts.&#34; This symptoms began approximately a week after the vaccination. I have no history of any of these conditions.

                                                Day 8, I woke with a headache, chills, vomited 4 times, muscle aches, and heart palpitations all day until around 8 pm. I couldn&#39;t keep food down until then. From Day 8 until yesterday (Day 11), I have been having intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, which is my only serious concern.  I have had a declining number of heart palpitations today, Day 12, but felt I should report these heart palpitations in case this is a sign of a serious complication. Should I avoid receiving the second dose?

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer on January 19, 2021.   3 days post vaccination (January 22, 2021) I developed right eye discomfort/irritation,  prickly sensations in throat.     On Jan 25, 2021 I developed tinnitus in right ear  which has still not resolved.     On January 30, 2021, went to ED with elevated BP 170/110, abdominal pain and tinnitus.    Had an abdominal  CT scan with contrast  which showed mesenteric inflammation (idiopathic etiology).   Was seen and evaluated by GI and had colonoscopy and endoscopy with no significant findings.    Took solu-medrol dose pack and abdominal pain symptoms  improved, but still not fully resolved.   On Feb 16 was seen by PCP for persisting, unilateral tinnitus.   Sent for MRI Brain which was normal .   Referred  for further evaluation by audiologist and otolaryngologist .  Was seen on  February 25, 2021 for right ear fullness, tinnitus.    Hearing test normal.   Diagnosed with right sided tinnitus.

He was initially bleeding and unconscious and was brought by EMS to the hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital he had a temperature of 40 C. He was found to have 2 small left temporal hemmorhagic contusions on CT scan. He had a seizure during the hospitalization. He was initially treated for HSV encephalitis but it is not clear if that was confirmed. The hospital team may not have known of the recent vaccination. He improved during the hospitalization, but remained with a very unsteady gait. He could not return to the group home. He was transferred to a rehab facility to receive PT on 02/16/2021. He remains at rehab. Prior to the fall, on the 3rd day after vaccination, on 2/8/21 at about 10 am, the patient coughed and had a small blood on the inside of his face mask while at his day program. He was seen by his PCP and had no abnormal findings. He had a CBC, BMP and CXR and all were unremarkable.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

I hit my head on a chair when I was falling and cut my head. I stayed laying down because I was still dizzy and hot. They called the squad and did vitals and I was fine. I sat there for about another half an hour and I went home. I have felt fine ever since. Only thing that hurt was my head from the fall.

                                                I received the vaccine at 12:15 PM.  I was a little tired but generally fine the rest of the day. I woke up at 2:30 and didn?t feel well. I got up to go to the bathroom. I started getting the chills and feeling dizzy. I passed out. My wife found me  passed out on the ground and bleeding. I needed six stitches in my head and have a black eye as well as other facial lacerations. I have no recollection of anything until my wife woke me.  I have never passed out in my life prior to this.

Within another 24 hours the pain shifted another 2 inches towards my left armpit. Pain can be slight to intense at times requiring me to sit down.  Within 24 hours I developed a painful bump in the trapezoid about halfway between neck and shoulder.  The bump has gone down now (day 10) but the pain continues. It?s relatively constant throughout the day but gets severe enough towards the evening to stop or minimize the use of my left arm. It seems to be activity related. The more I need to do that day, the worse it is in the evening. Pain in left arm has been as expected but continues at day 10. It is slowly subsiding and is minimal compared to the other two pain locations.

                                                Within 30-minutes of vaccination, the patient reported a headache, slurred speech, and right side weakness. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was hypertensive (197/129) with a FSBG of 95mg/dL. During stroke assessment, the patient had new onset facial palsy/droop and need speech abnormality which signaled a stroke alert. 12-lead EKG was unremarkable. EMS transported the patient to Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient presented with a headache, chest heaviness, and slurred speech, but no aphasia. NIH stroke scale was 0. Patient remained hypertensive (170/109). Labs, tests, and imaging did not indicate rtPA administration. ED physician administered 0.4mg SL Nitroglycerin, 10mg IV Hydralazine, and 325mg PO Aspirin prior to admission for suspected Transient Ischemic Attack. Upon admission, differential was TIA vs. CVA vs. ACS. Admitting physician ordered HbA1C, lipid panel, MRI brain, CTA head/neck, 2D echo, and neurology consult. Throughout course of admission, patient had recurring midsternal chest pain that was relieved with Nitroglycerin. Imaging ruled out CVA. Given elevated TGs and Cholesterol, patient was started on Atorvastatin 40mg PO. Suspected TIA and ACS.  Neurology consult reviewed the labs and imaging, and stated the episodes of stuttering are most commonly associated with anxiety or stress reaction. Neuro did not recommend any further workup unless this happened again unprovoked. Patient was discharged after a 3-day admission with diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease, unspecified. The patient was prescribed 81mg PO Aspirin, 20mg PO Lisinopril, and 40mg PO Atorvastatin.

Pulmonary embolism without acute cor pulmonale, unspecified chronicity, unspecified pulmonary embolism type (HCC) 04/26/2021   Resolved Hospital Problems No resolved problems to display.   CONSULTS: None    INPATIENT PROCEDURES: None    DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: Patient is a 51 y.o. male with a past medical history of psoriasis, environmental allergies who presents today with sudden shortness of breath, left side pleuritic chest pain 7/10, worsened with deep inspiration.  No recent travel, no family history, no history of malignancies, no immobilization or surgeries. He had his 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on April 1.  He does not have a history of COVID-19 infection, and COVID-19 PCR test was negative in ER. His blood pressure is a little high at 170 6/83 mm, pulse 76 per minute saturating 96% on room air, troponin less than 6, BNP 16, WBC 12.3,, EKG without any significant ST T-wave changes. CT angiogram of the chest shows nonocclusive thrombi in almost all the lobes, there is no saddle embolus noted.  There is no evidence of right heart strain.  Echo: The technical quality of the exam was limited due to suboptimal acoustic windows. The left ventricle is normal in size. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness. The left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. Regional wall motion abnormalities cannot be excluded due to limited visualization. The right ventricular size, thickness, and function are normal. No significant valvular pathology identified with Doppler examination. There was insufficient tricuspid regurgitation envelope detected to calculate right ventricular systolic pressure.  Injection of contrast documented no interatrial shunt. There is no comparison study available.  He was started on Heparin gtt. And admitted for observation. He required no supplemental oxygen. He was discharged later pm on Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, than 5 mg bid for 3 months. I am questioning did he had COVID-19 vaccine related bilateral PE. His hypercoagulable profile is pending. He has no sign of malignancy, no new symptoms, no weight loss. He had normal colonoscopy 2 yrs ago.  He should follow up with his PCP.  He was given work excuse from 4/26-5/3/21. She shouldn&#39;t take non steroidal anti-inflammatory (Ibuprofen (Motrin), Naproxen, Naprosyn, Voltaren, Relafen ... meds because of blood thinner Eliquis.

Patient is a 51-year-old male with a PMHx significant for hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis and morbid obesity who initially presented to the ED for evaluation of chest pain, cough and shortness of breath.   On presentation, vitals were mostly unremarkable other than some mild tachycardia and tachypnea.  Patient was able to maintain adequate oxygenation on room air but was placed on supplemental oxygen for comfort.  Blood work was mostly unremarkable.  ABG was not particularly concerning.  Troponin was negative x3.  Patient underwent chest CTA which showed basilar atelectasis bilaterally and scattered groundglass opacities and scattered borderline size hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes consistent with patient&#39;s known sarcoidosis.   Patient was treated with supportive care and monitored overnight.  He was able to maintain sufficient oxygen levels.  On the time my evaluation, patient continues to complain of bilateral rib pain worse with deep breaths consistent with costochondritis.  I discussed with the patient that he will need to continue to take NSAIDs on a scheduled basis to help with his discomfort.  Additionally I offered to prescribe cough medicine. I discussed possibly discharging the patient on steroids however he states that he makes a point to avoid taking steroids due to his history of hemochromatosis.  At this point, patient no longer requires care in the hospital and can be discharged home.  Patient is agreeable with the plan and all questions have been answered appropriately.

A 51-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ER8729), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 26Apr2021 17:00 (at the age of 51-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included insomnia. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included mirtazapine taken as sleep aid. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ER8734) administered in left arm on 05Apr2021 18:00 (at the age of 51-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 27Apr2021 19:00, the patient experienced pronounced exhaustion, occasional mild headaches, and a transient heart arrhythmia usually lasting 5-15 seconds.  These symptoms have not subsided, and the arrhythmia became persistent enough last night that it required a trip to the local ER. The consistent heart palpitations which ultimately brought him into the ER. The patient was referred to a local cardiologist and was told not to worry about the arrhythmia, that it would clear up in a few days. The reported events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. There was no treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                On 5/20/21 the patient was at home with his mother when he had acute nausea, light-headedness, and abdominal pain. He presented to the ED by ambulance. Excerpt from ED notes od MD follows: &#34;Initial ED interventions: iv fluids, low dose iv ativan, iv toradol, iv zofran.  ED course: patient arrives very anxious, writhing on bed, difficult to redirect. With chronic tonicity, not seizing. Mother arrives, and he recognizes her, seems to be consoled somewhat by her presence, but she is unable to direct him, and describes his behavior as irregular, and events acute this evening at her home.  Patient rests, and then HR decrease to 50s on monitior and patient found to be pulseless - I immediately start chest compressions, and achieve ROSC after PEA arrest with administration of EPI/compressions. Patient intubated per procedure note without complication. L femoral central attained per procedure note without complication. CPR performed over ED course intermittently (always PEA arrest) with ROSC achieved with administration of EPI, EPI drip started in addition to sedation meds, and iv fluids. No obvious STEMI on ECG to administer lytics, with suspicion of dissection and AAA prominent. I am able to stabilze and accompany patient to CT suite, where I recognize B/L massive PE immediately. I discuss with Dr. of Cardiology, who agrees with admininstration of alteplase. I disucss risks with mother who consents verbally. Patient without response to alteplase, and with continued pattern of PEA arrest following bradycardia. I discuss etiology of presentation with mother,and that patient is with very poor prognosis of survival, and likely poorer prognosis of neurological status, and patient is made comfort care, and fentanyl drip increased, patient is taken off of ventilation and drips. Pronounced deceased at 22:00.  MDM: Initial concern for but not limited to appendicitis, AAA, diverticulitis, renal stones, pyelonephritis, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis, toxic ingestion, ACS, obstruction, perforation, sepsis (2/2 PNA, UTI, meningitis, intra-abdominal infection), AAA, dissection, PE - as ED course progresses, differential narrows and consider more likely PEA arrest secondary to ACS, PE, dissection, AAA, necrotic pancreatitis, tension PNX (less likely). Considered but do not suspect seizures, stroke. Imaging studies reviewed - CXR with ETT in place, no acute pathology. CTA chest/A/P remarkable for massive proximal B/L PE. Labs reviewed. ECGs without STEMI, with sinus tach initially, LBBB after initial ROSC, and then AFib in RVR on subsequent ECG. Per above, patient suffered massive B/L PE, with subsequent cardiac arrest, despite heoric efforts including thrombolysis. Death called art 22:00.  Diagnosis: massive B/L PEs, PEA arrest.  Disposition: deceased.&#34;

There was a blood clot in my brain that was broken up after tPA was administered about 2 hours after the symptoms of the stroke set in. To date (May 30) I have had many tests, including 2 MRIs, CT scans, TEE, heart monitoring etc.    So far, it has been called a &#34;cryptogenic stroke&#34; because there is no cause.  The only thing different was the vaccine I received 5 days before the stroke.

The second shot triggered a reaction similar to being stung by a wasp, I am allergic to wasps and carry an epipin; however, I broke out in a red rash all over my body and remained very red Saturday and Sunday and now months later, I have unexplained rashes which  pop up on my arms from time to time. Thankfully, they go away within a day or so,  but the rashes are annoying, especially bc they seem to be spontaneous.  Also, when I got the second shot, it felt like someone was grabbing my heart from time to time on the morning of my shot. Sorry for only reporting this now.

He said he had some pain at the injection site and mild headache in the afternoon; however, around 12 to 1 am in the morning, he was feeling heart palpitation and he felt his muscle twitching from his upper torso which went down to his thigh and no loss of consciousness.  He said he checked his heart rate and it was 70 and he did not have any problems breathing.  He said his heart palpitation felt better after taking some deep breaths.  He said he no longer had heart palpitations or muscle twitching any more.  He denied any other symptoms.   Generally, he appeared well, no facial drooping, awake, alert, oriented, speech clear, and normal gait. (Today)

A 52-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ELO140) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 11Jan2021 at 9:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The relevant medical history included Covid-19 from 17Jul2020 to 14Aug2020, he didn&#39;t get hospitalized but was pretty sick. He had circulation issues with it. He had numbing and tingling in his left three fingers (clarified left three fingers as his middle finger, index finger, and ring finger) and numbing and tingling in his toes as well. Concomitant medications included ubidecarenone (COQ-10), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), rosuvastatin and monascus purpureus (RED YEAST RICE). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 52 years old on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. With second dose the patient thought he would be better, but about 12 hours later he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm. He checked his body temperature and he didn&#39;t have a temp. His temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit. He tried to keep himself warm. He got nauseous with it. Basically he looked on line and was having them. Today he started to feel better, but still a little nauseous. He had severe fatigue. He didn&#39;t realize he could go fill out something on the website for CDC. He knew he had wanted the vaccine because he had some severe symptoms when he had COVID. He didn&#39;t want to get COVID again. His hospital frustrates him sometimes. They didn&#39;t put the date on there when he was to come back for the second dose. They didn&#39;t tell him to come back on the 13th. He had to figure the dates from the website and emails. He talked it over with his wife. He came in contact with it every night. He was taking care of people that were critical. He worked in the intensive care unit. Even the people he took care of that didn&#39;t have it, ended up with it. He wore a mask. He used hand sanitizer. He didn&#39;t want to get it again. People were shocked when he got it the first time. He did verify that he got the second dose one day sooner, instead of the three day window. He was sick with the first and was expecting to be more sick with this one. He wanted to give himself an extra day before he had to go back to work. He had a couple of emails where they discussed increasing the window to do it a day sooner. He was going to have to go an hour an half a way to get the second dose and he didn&#39;t want to do that. The patient underwent lab test included height was approximately six two, weight was about 194 lbs on an unspecified date, and body temperature showed 96 degrees Fahrenheit in Jan2021. The outcome of the event he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm, temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit was recovering, for the events he got nauseous with it and he had severe fatigue were not recovered.

History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: None, this was the first dose. No other vaccine administered on the same date. The patient had no events prior vaccination within 4 weeks. In all his life. He had vaccines that received and had no adverse event or side effect whatsoever. He had had the regular flu vaccine early November. The patient experienced feeling anxiousness in the brain, Heaviness in the head, feeling weak in Feb2021, Localized soreness and pain in Jan2021, Goosebumps tingly sensation in head, Blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat is getting higher and higher on 04Feb2021. The patient could not take Benadryl as he cannot tolerate Benadryl. With Zyterc he does not have secondary effects like he does with Benadryl. The first week after getting the vaccine he only had kind of had localized soreness and pain in the area. He later clarified it was in the area where got the injection, vaccine. He just had pain soreness in that area. Other than that he had no side effects at that time. The third week, initially stated as, about 5-7 days ago he started to have a feeling of anxiousness in the brain. He could feel anxiousness and sensation in his brain that he did not feel before. It was like he had the flu kind of thing, but he did not have a temperature. However, the feeling is in his head. It is like heaviness feeling from the flu in his head. He has been having the heaviness in the head feeling for 4-5 days. He later further clarified and initially clarified the localized pain and soreness was noticed the second day, the day after getting the vaccine. This only lasted a few days. He does not remember exactly when this ended. He did not take anything for the localized pain and soreness in the same area as the injection. He confirmed he has recovered completely from this event. Caller further clarified the feeling of anxiousness started Thursday or Friday of last week, maybe 05Feb2021. Stated it was like this feeling is getting worse and worse. Stated it was hard to explain, but he started to feel a goosebumps tingly sensation in his brain in head, in scalp Thursday of last week first. It started with that and slowly over the past few days it has changed and transformed into this heaviness feeling that one would feel from the flu, but he has no fever or anything; it is just in his head. Also, along with that feeling at the same time his blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat was getting higher and higher. His regular blood pressure medications won&#39;t work anymore to bring it down. His blood pressure typically ranges in the 130/85 or less range with all the blood pressure medications he was taking. Once he started having this tingling sensation in his head he had the higher blood pressure and higher heart rate. Now his blood pressure would average being about 170/110 to 180/115. This was like the upper and lower range. His heart rate was typically around 70-75 and now it goes about 80-85. Later during call, he also added, every six months or so his blood pressure may be elevated on these medications. Sometimes his blood pressure was not maintained by the three different blood pressure medications he takes. He was also prescribed two other medications for emergent use Clonidine and Xanax. Usually every six months he would have to take Clonidine and Xanax and typically in an hour to two hours the blood pressure would come down and it&#39;s good. However, this time, he took two Clonidine and Xanax starting last Thursday when had the high blood pressure episode and they were failing to bring the blood pressure down. He further explained it would bring it down for some time, but then it would go back high. The Clonidine is no longer working for the last six days.

He went to see his primary care provider on Monday. On Monday the doctor doubled the dose of Carvedilol. Since then instead of taking 12.5 twice a day, he is now taking 25mg twice a day. On Tuesday, yesterday, he went to get blood work done. Blood was drawn but has no results yet. Localized pain and soreness time of onset didn&#39;t remember, stated he may have had a little pain right after getting the vaccine, but it was around 21:00 25Jan2021 he really noticed the soreness and pain. The following morning around 9 AM it woke him from his sleep and he could feel it more compared to the first day. Anxiousness in the brain around 16:00. The patient had no emergency visit. Stated he almost felt like going when his blood pressure was 182/116 on Saturday night of last week. He was about to go to the ER but decided not to.

Over the next 2 weeks I experienced vascular claudication in that leg and was eventually diagnosed with arterial thrombus in Left tibioperoneal, anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial  arteries. I do not have any known predisposing conditions for arterial thrombus and no history of thromboembolic disease.

Only occurs during the evening around bedtime or while I&#39;m sleeping, and occurs every other day.  Blood is a steady stream that begins with no warning.  Blood flow stops after I push tissues up my right nostril and apply gentle pressure for 15 minutes or so.  I have never experienced this before.

Probably not, but i thought best to report it in case others have had similar medical issues coincidentally with getting the shot.  One week after the shot I was hospitalized with a Pericardial Effusion and required a Pericardiocentesis procedure.

(My normal resting rate is about 80 bpm). Heart rate came back up shortly but still below my normal bpm. When I got home at 7am was very weak and chilled, and on both hands my fingers turned completely white like they wasn?t getting circulation and were very cold.. I went to bed feeling horrible hoping it wasn?t serious and after I slept more than normal, I feel good now.  Can?t say my heart rate going that low wasn?t kinda scary.

When I woke up to go to the bathroom at 4:30 in the morning I was not feeling well in my stomach and I felt a little dizzy.  On my way back to bed from the bathroom I fainted and fell face first into the wall heater and then to to the floor.  This action fractured my nose and gave me multiple bruises and cuts in my face and upper body.

By 4PM CDT, the pain was bad enough that co-workers insisted I go to the hospital for evaluation. At approximately 4:30PM CDT, a co-worker drove me to the hospital. I was admitted at 5:16 PM CDT on 13 March 2021 to  Medical Center, to treat multiple, bi-lateral pulmonary embolism. While still in the emergency room, I was injected with a blood thinner. I was released from the hospital on 15 March 2021, with a prescription for APIXABAN (Eliquis), which I am required to take for 6-months. I was directed to see my primary care physician within 3-weeks of being discharged.

Patient stated, that he had been trying to report an adverse reaction to the Pfizer COVID 19 Vaccine, the second shot through the &#39;portfolio&#39; on the website and he tried 3 times and for whatever reasons it just won&#39;t transmit the information. So he was wondering, it is possible to report that with a live agent today. The outcome was not recovered for Hand and feet were extremely cold and unknown for rest of the events.

                                                I had COVID in early December 2020.  I waited a few months to get the vaccine.  I was fine the day of the vaccine 16 MAR.  I took the next day off 17 MAR  because I was running a fever and and had body aches.  I did not have any alcohol on St Patty&#39;s day.  I pretty much slept the whole day.  I went back to work on 18 MAR and was feeling better with only a mild ever.  The night of 18 MAR I began to run a fever and had body aches.  The body aches worsened during the night I could not sleep.  The body aches became centralized in my upper back and shoulders,  My neck was hurting too.  I began to feel chest pains.  The chest pains increased in intensity.  I researched the symptom&#39;s which suggested I was having a heart attack.  I took some aspirin to try to alleviate the pain.   The pain continued and more severe so I drove myself to hospital. The staff  gave me an EKG and took blood samples for testing.  The EKG was normal.  The blood test came back with elevated levels of Troponin.  The Dr.  advised that the Troponin level indicated that I probably had a heart attack. the first hospital did not have a cardiac unit so I was transferred to  downtown location.  The staff there ran more test.  The EKG was again normal and the Troponin elevated so a Coronary angiography was conducted with catheter and dye.  The angiography was also normal with no sign of a heart attack the doctor said I probably had a reaction to the vaccine.  He suggested that I still get the second vaccine.  I did  get the second vaccine. After the second vaccine I only had fever and body aches, I pre0-gamed with aprin  and plenty of rest for the second vaccine.

A 52-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 08May2021 at 15:30 (at the age of 52 years old) (Batch/Lot number: EW0176, Expiration date was unknown) as the 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/Lot number: ER8730, Expiration date was unknown) on 17Apr2021 at 2:30 PM (at the age of 52 years old) for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was not administered at the military facility. Relevant medical history included ongoing high cholesterol, ongoing high low density lipoproteins (LDLs), ongoing high triglycerides, and patient might have borderline diabetes, possibly prediabetic, but the reporter was not quite sure. The patient had family history of heart problems. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications, but the reporter did not know the medications that the patient was taking. It was also reported that the patient was not completely compliant with his medications. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior to vaccinations (within 4 weeks), the patient had no other vaccinations and there were no adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations. The reporter stated that in the morning at the time of the report on 13May2021, about 5 days after the second COVID-19 vaccine, the patient had signs of a transient ischemic attack; he lost control of the left side of the face and possibly of the left side of his body; he had elevated blood pressure 180/100 and came down to 140/100 after the one-hour long episode; and he experienced weakness, but was able to move around. At the time of the report, the patient was on his way to the emergency room (ER). The event &#34;loss of control of left side of face&#34; did require a visit to the emergency room. It was further reported that the patient had signs of a transient ischemic attack and loss of control of the left side of his face and maybe the left side of his body, but the reporter was not sure; he also had some weakness and this episode lasted about an hour during which time the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 180/100. After the hour, his blood pressure came down to about 140/100. The patient was able to move around and on the way to the emergency department. No further information was available regarding the patient&#39;s visit to the emergency room at the time of the report. The reporter was asking for information on transient ischemic attacks and the Covid 19 vaccine and if there were reports of strokes as well. The reporter stated his family called several doctor friends and doctor relatives and based on the patient&#39;s symptoms, it seemed likely that he had a transient ischemic attack. The outcome of the events was unknown.

But the coughing stayed for over a month. As of today (5/31/2021), I still cough occasionally.  * Fast heart beat. My normal heart beat is 57-60 per min. After the first shot, my heart beat went to 70 above, some times 80 and above. The fast heart beat stayed for weeks. That was why I was hesitant to take the second shot. Eventually I took the second shot on 5/26/2021, 33 days after the first shot. I did not have much side effect for the second shot, except sleepiness. Ironically, on 5/30/2021, I suddenly felt much better after getting up from the bed. I measure my heart beat, it was below 60, back to normal.  Fatigue.  I  did not feel the same as before after the first shot.  I felt fatigue. Un thet weenkend after my second shot,  I was back to normal. No fatigue any more.

A 52-years-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 21May2021 10:10 (reported as 10:10 EST) (at the age of 52-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 22May2021, the patient called to report an adverse reaction to 1st dose of vaccine, and currently in the emergency room (ER) at the hospital, in a bed with heavy clotting issues in his left kidney through his bladder which was causing urinary issues, literally urinating large blood clots. He currently had a catheter in, they have done blood work and CT scan, but no results provided. The patient had no issues with anything with prostate or kidney but hemorrhaging blood clots. The patient was not yet admitted to the hospital, just in the ER somewhere around 10:00 in the morning. The patient had a follow up and still at home had a catheter and still he was bleeding and follow up tomorrow with Urology department at 10:00; had full blood work follow up tomorrow and had a CT scan. Everything came back as normal as far as his organs go. The patient added, &#34;I would appreciate it if someone would call me with some professional advice what I should do about this whether I need to take the second dose. I need some clarification on what is going on with this and then I need to have a discussion on whether I should take the second dose or not.&#34; The outcome of the event was not recovered, at the time of this report. The seriousness of the events was unspecified by the reporter.  There is a medical information request included Caller (male, age 52 years)- his question was the first and 2nd dose the same. Tomorrow he should have the full make up back and causes of this from the doctor. It has been a rather traumatic event which he thought was going to be nothing.&#34; Due date of second dose. Response included: As noted in the Fact Sheet for Recipients, the patient should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if he had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if he had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. They refer him to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. His healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.&#34; and from VR-As the Prescribing Information does not include all adverse reactions that have been reported or that may occur, please consult with doctor/healthcare provider about what he had experienced/were experiencing.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

A 52-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 15May2021 10:50 (Lot Number: EW0173; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included vasovagal reactions in high school. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Within 2 minutes of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine he started feeling like something was wrong. He pulled to the side in the parking garage and as soon as he stopped the car he passed out. He woke back up and was able to put the car in park and he passed out a second time. He woke up again and his foot was on the gas pedal and he tried to roll down the window. He was able to roll down the window but he wasn&#39;t able to get anyone&#39;s attention. He passed out a third time. When he woke up again he wasn&#39;t able to get the door open and he was nauseated. He basically had nausea, dizziness, and a definite lack of coordination. He just had sort of a feeling like being really drunk. He doesn&#39;t drink. He had very little strength but he was able to push his car horn. He was out of it. He could see someone in his car mirror a little ways behind his car and the horn didn&#39;t get the person&#39;s attention so he honked a second time and someone came to help him, maybe from the fire department and maybe some emergency medical technicians. He was placed on a golf cart or ATV to be transported downstairs to a waiting ambulance and while on the ride he vomited himself. He mentioned that the EMTs called it a vasovagal reaction. He was brought to the hospital in which he had a lot of tests done. He did not feel well at all and was not able to feel well enough to stand up. He had tests done at the hospital, a chest x-ray and his blood was drawn. He had a cardiac ultrasound later in the afternoon the next day on 16May2021. The doctor&#39;s didn&#39;t find anything wrong other than his cholesterol was high at 208. He was admitted to the hospital on 15May2021. He continued to have his blood drawn through the night and the next morning, on 16May2021, he had a CAT scan. For his cholesterol he was told to eat better and maybe follow up with a doctor in a couple months to check his cholesterol again. No one had any answers to the effect of what happened to him. Everything was fine, his tests were normal. He was told he had a vasovagal reaction. He&#39;s had vasovagal reactions before and he can tell this was much different than the vasovagal reactions he&#39;s had before. In the past when he&#39;s had vasovagal reactions the world went black like looking through a small circle, his vision got blacker and blacker and then he&#39;d pass out. He did not have this feeling with the Covid 19 vaccine. He can only describe this feeling that he had like an occasion in his past when he&#39;s drank to much and he&#39;s stumbling around. He may have passed out briefly to someone helping him move to a bed and his arms are weighted and he can&#39;t lift them and he&#39;s disoriented but still has a sense of what&#39;s going on but he feels like he could vomit at any second. He&#39;s comparing his experience to the Covid 19 vaccine to drinking to much alcohol and then falling asleep or passing out. He was pretty much out of it for 5 hours. Between the fourth and fifth hours after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine he was comfortable enough to stand on his own for brief moments. He was feeling better and was able to use the restroom. By the next day, around the 24 hour period after the vaccine he was feeling almost normal. He was released from the hospital the next day, 16May2021 at around 4:00PM. He was maybe in the hospital for about 27 to 28 hours. At the hospital he had all these tests and he was found to be healthy with no problems. He also had a Covid 19 virus test, he never asked what the results were but he&#39;s going under the assumption that if he was Covid 19 virus positive the hospital staff would have told him. Passing out, nausea, dizziness required a visit to Emergency Room. The outcome was unknown.

A 52-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 23Apr2021 (lot number: EN0170), as 2nd dose, single dose, at age 52 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), administered in the left arm, on 24Mar2021 (lot number: EP6955), at age 52 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within four weeks of BNT162B2. On 23Apr2021, the patient received his second dose of BNT162B2. On 23Apr2021 at 19:30, the patient experienced injection pain/injection site extreme pain. The patient did not act on it because he knew the injection site may be sore for a week. On 24Apr2021, the injection site was hurting bad but again he did not act on it because he knew it may sore but it had been a whole month and it was concerning. The reporter stated that the pain was causing the patient&#39;s blood pressure to be elevated. The reporter noticed the blood pressure elevation about 2 weeks after the second injection in the morning time (May2021). The patient also experienced headache at the same time as when the patient&#39;s blood pressure was elevated around the morning time, about 2 weeks after the second injection (May2021). It was reported that the pain was so bad that the patient could not sleep at night within a week of the second injection (Apr2021), time of onset was reported as &#34;around 15:00 or 16:00 and as it goes over to the night 190:0 or 20:00, sometimes he is not going to sleep until 02:00 the next morning&#34;). The events required physician&#39;s office visit on an unspecified date (reported as &#34;the other day&#34;) and the reporter brought the events to the doctor&#39;s attention and stated that the patient was in pain throughout the day. The reporter was thinking of taking the patient to urgent care. Treatment for the event &#34;injection pain/injection site extreme pain&#34; and &#34;pain&#34; included heating pads, ice packs, lidocaine patches, unspecified cream and rubbing lotion to try and ease the pain. The reporter was thinking about Advil and asked every how many hours should the patient take the Advil. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

The first day:  I took the covid-19 vaccine Pfizer shot on Thursday the 4th of March; there was pain at the injection site just as any other vaccine I have been administered during military service.  After the shot I felt tied, and my left arm did hurt from the shot, I started to feel irritable (angry or even aggressive), my chest became tight and my heart rhyme felt somewhat off causing me to start coughing and sometimes uncontrollable to the point I could not catch my breath I thought about seeking medical attention but did not..  The second day:  Pain in my left arm went away at the injection site, tiredness went away, and the feeling of irritable (angry or even aggressiveness) went away, tightness in my chest and coughing went away. I have been having a chronic pain in my left arm for about a year and after the shot the pain was gone I noticed that on the second day. I did notice my body temperature was up and down showing symptoms of histamine reaction but not out of control.

The took my vitals and found the my blood pressure had dropped to 85/45.  They called 911 and hit me with an EpiPen.  I never blacked out.  After another 10 minutes the fire department arrived and they took vital signs; all normal.  Another 10 minutes and ambulance arrived.  Vitals in the back of the ambulance were fine.  Got to the emergency room and vitals were fine including ekg.  Was released from the hospital about 4.5 hours after the initial shot.  I feel a little sluggish today but otherwise fine.

Then that night I woke up at 2:30 AM with severe pain in my right knee.  I was unable to bend the knee or walk for the next 36 hours.  After that the pain transitioned to the back of my calf muscle for the next few days.  The pain then went back to my knee for a day and then returned to the back of my calf muscle.  On 3/30/21 I saw my primary care physician who then sent me to get an ultrasound which determined that the pain in my knee and calf were caused by blood clots (DVT).  I was then prescribed Eliquis 5 mg blood thinners.

I then called my wife and talk to her (and my children) about what was happening and where I was. I asked to call 911 if I loose consciousness. At about fity five-Sixty minutes went by and symptoms were unchanged  and I took third dose of 6.25 mg of cavedilol.

                                                Blood clots in right leg below knee; he passed out from pain; pain in his right knee; he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all; knee was swollen; couldn&#39;t walk/limping around; his knee more stiff; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 53-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 21Mar2021 at 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing Factor V Leiden heterozygous, allergies to mushrooms from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and a torn meniscus in his right knee and he had surgery 3 to 4 years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Cephalexin and Percocet and experienced allergies. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested post vaccination. On 22Mar2021 at night around 2:30AM, the patient woke up and started walking to the bathroom and he passed out from pain. He had pain in his right knee. He thought he had torn his knee again. He had surgery 3 or 4 years ago for a torn meniscus in his right knee and he thought he had torn his meniscus again. He passed out, his wife found him and he went back to bed. In the morning, his knee was still very very sore, he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all. He took an Advil between 6:30AM and 8:00AM. He hadn&#39;t taken any medications prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. His knee was swollen but the pain was manageable. He couldn&#39;t walk, he was on crutches for about 24 hours then the swelling started coming down and he put a brace on his knee. He could then walk without the crutches but it was still painful. The next day he had pain in the back of his knee. He thought the pain was caused because he had put the brace on and had been using the crutches. Like he had made his knee more stiff from not using it. He was limping around and the pain was bearable. At that point, the pain was maybe a 4 on a scale of 1-10 where his pain had been a 9 on a scale of 1-10. He took another Advil and he realized the pain in the back of his knee wasn&#39;t going away. He went to see his family doctor and his doctor was able to get him in that same day for an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed 2 blood clots behind his right knee. The patient had blood clots in right leg below knee. The week of the report, he got an appointment with a hematologist. The hematologist reviewed his case and the doctor isn&#39;t 100% sure the blood clots were from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine but the doctor isn&#39;t ruling it out either because it happened within 24 hours of receiving his first COVID-19 dose. He hadn&#39;t done anything strenuous before getting the COVID-19 vaccine, nothing that he thinks would have caused the blood clots. He would like to add, what he thinks is relevant, is that he is positive for Factor V. He reports he has one copy and Factor V only impacts about 3% of the population. The hematologist thought that he might be prone to developing blood clots. The hematologist reports that he has had patients who have had the COVID-19 virus who have developed blood clots. Maybe it&#39;s possible that the COVID-19 antibodies were trying to build up his immune system to COVID-19 and it created something similar to having the COVID-19 virus. If he is predisposed to blood clots then the COVID-19 vaccine may have precipitated the blood clots. His second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for Sunday, 11Apr2021. He had talked to both his family doctor and his hematologist and they both thought he should be ok in getting the second COVID-19 vaccine. He was prescribed blood thinners. If the second COVID-19 vaccine caused more blood clots the blood thinners would help him. He was asking if there is any additional information or guidance on receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine after his reaction. The pharmacist told him that the COVID-19 vaccine trials were all done in the left arm. He received his vaccine in his right arm and his right knee was affected. If he gets the second COVID-19 vaccine he&#39;s getting it in his left arm. He was prescribed Eliquis 5mg take one tablet twice daily. The outcome of the event blood clots in right leg below knee was recovering while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 53-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm at 53 years old on 20Mar2021 08:00 (Lot Number: EP7534) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure from 2018, he says he has had this for roughly 3 years. Concomitant medication included amlodipine at 5mg once a day for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date in 2018 and ongoing, he says he has been taking this for a few years, maybe 3 years. No additional vaccines were administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect or within 4 weeks. He was not sick at the time of vaccination previously. The patient was calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He says he is just trying to get answers because what he experienced was very alarming to him. He got the vaccine at 8:00 in the morning. He says a student did it, she took a long time, she was very timid. He says she was being supervised by an RN. He experienced shortness of breath on 07Apr2021, he says it was in the morning that the shortness of breath started, because he did make an appointment to go the the COVID test, he got the COVID test around noon that same day. He says he was diagnosed with pericardial effusion requiring drainage and inflammation of the heart sac. He says he had fluid overload on the lungs that required IV diuretics. He says the symptoms started after the vaccine, and these symptoms were what was causing the shortness of breath. He says the fluid around the heart made the heart beat super fast to pump up blood. He says the fluid triggered the shortness of breath. He says when they removed fluid the breathing got easier but then it settled into the lungs. He says Tuesday he dropped off the cliff, Tuesday or Wednesday night, one of them, for two nights he was on oxygen, they gave him a diuretic for the lungs, after 12 hours he started feeling better, continued to get better and better after they moved the fluid from the lungs with Lasix through the IV. He says he doesn&#39;t fit the profile of someone who would develop these issues, he has no history, no cancer, no autoimmune disorders. He says they say well maybe it is the virus but the doctors currently have no specific answers for the caller. He says they told him that someone having this would be the profile of an IV drug user. He says he never uses drugs, he does not fit a profile like this. He says he wants to be fully vaccinated. He says the timing is suspicious with the vaccine shot. He says it is 50/50 on the doctor&#39;s opinions, half say to get the shot, the other half say don&#39;t do it. He says they say the second shot is worse. He says he is confused as to what to do, that he understands this is a big experiment, he wants the vaccine but not at the cost of another visit to the hospital. He says he was at the hospital on oxygen, he couldn&#39;t get out of bed for a day. He says the doctor said there was a study in (Withheld), the caller says he did a lot of research in the hospital for 6 days, that says the demographic is younger but it is heart issues with men for the heart with the Pfizer vaccine. He says they are studying it. He says a couple of doctors referred to that, the ones that say don&#39;t get the shot, not yet. He says he can&#39;t pinpoint it exactly. He says it could have been a fluke but the timing is very suspicious. He says that because of some of the side effects, his week in hospital, he was concerned for his life, he wants to be fully vaccinated but not at the cost of going though this or cost of killing him. He says he does not want to go through this again, he will not get vaccinated unless he is comfortable. He asks should he switch to (Withheld), is that a safer bet, (Withheld), should he just skip it all together or not. He says he knows they are a different type of vaccine. He says they had to remove fluid form his pericardial sac, he had 2 days of draining, they drained a liter from around the heart so it could beat normal again. He says apparently some of the fluid went to the lungs so he needed oxygen. He says this all happened Tuesday morning, he came back home yesterday, he looks pretty good. He says he just wants to do the vaccine and asks should he take the second one or not. He would like to get any information. He says the fluid in his heart was starting to build up on 05Apr2021 or 06Apr2021, he started getting symptoms that come and go. He says he was admitted to the hospital on 19Apr2021 and his procedure was on 20Apr2021 so his shortness of breath resolved the day after the procedure. He says he was hospitalized from 19Apr2021 to 25Apr2021. After reporting shortness of breath he says that was it, basically. He says he went to the nurse treatment center on 19Apr2021 because he thought it might be COVID but this event landed him in the hospital. The events required a visit to emergency room, he said he went to the emergency room on 19Apr2021 and a doctor told him he might not make it. The patient said he was scared and he didn&#39;t know why the doctor would have said that to him. He said he did not have an appointment date to physician office yet, he was waiting to get a call back. Relevant Tests included: Rapid COVID test, Date 07Apr2021 Result negative, Date 15Apr2021 Result negative, Date 19Apr2021 at Patient First Result negative, Date 19Apr2021 at the hospital on admittance, Result negative. Standard COVID test, Date 19Apr2021 Result negative, Date 15Apr2021 Result negative. He says at the hospital there was a lot of tests done on his heart and lungs, nothing was coming back scary, they were coming back as perhaps viral markers. The outcome of shortness of breath was recovered on 21Apr2021, of other events was unknown.

A 53-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 53-year-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Apr2021 11:15 (Lot Number: EW0153) at 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. The patient received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included famotidine (PEPCID AC).  The patient previously took flu shot in Oct2020, prilosec [omeprazole magnesium] for seasonal allergy and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced unexpected bruising near injection site. Bruise was the size of the bandaid, approximately 1&#34; x 2&#34;. Bruising had persisted for more than a week now. The patient had never experienced bruising like this with other vaccines. He would like to rule out possible thrombosis reaction before second shot. He did not have bruising at any other locations other than the injection site.  Bruise was purple and red splotches and has now progressed to mostly yellow. He believed the discoloration was a reaction to the vaccine and not the result of the needle. The shot itself was painful but patient felt minimal pain/stiffness following the shot. The event start date was on 20Apr2021. No treatment was received. The outcome was unknown.

This lasted for about 4 hrs after the shot, but was most noticed directly after the shot.  I did not say anything because I blew it off as me bei g nervous about the shot, but Im not really ever apprehensive or nervous during shots.  The exact same thing happened for the second shot,  little more intensely thi, but was ready for reaction so did not make fuss about it an did not contact nurse on duty or my doctor afterwards, but noticed that other people were having heart reactions with the Pfizer Vac, so thought should let you know about my reactions even tho molder than those reported.

                                                At 5:30 am the day following vaccination woke up with severe new unset right flank pain.  Went to ED and was found to have a kidney stone on CT scan.  Was treated with hydration and Toradol.  However, spiked a fever (possibly due to vaccine) and was pan-cultured (blood x2 and urine) and given IV antibiotics for possible UTI/pyelo.  Blood and urine cultures were negative and was discharged after overnight observation.  Did not have a history of kidney stones before this event.

A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 (at the age of 54-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included metformin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, glimepiride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, lisinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient experienced not feeling well, ate a bit but not much, kind of pale, vomiting, trouble in breathing, and agitated on 04Jan2021; body was hyper dried and restless on 05Jan2021; mind just seemed like it was racing on 06Jan2021; and not responsive and he passed away on 06Jan2021 at 10:15 (reported as: around 10:15 AM). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the vaccine on 04Jan2021, after which he started not feeling well. He went right home and went to bed. He woke up and ate a bit but not much and then was kind of pale. The patient then started to vomit, which continued throughout the night. He was having trouble in breathing. Emergency services were called, and they took his vitals and said that everything was okay, but he was very agitated; reported as not like this prior to the vaccine. The patient was taken to urgent care where they gave him an unspecified steroid shot and unspecified medication for vomiting. The patient was told he was probably having a reaction to the vaccine, but he was just dried up. The patient continued to vomit throughout the day and then he was very agitated again and would fall asleep for may be 15-20 minutes. When the patient woke up, he was very restless (reported as: his body was just amped up and could not calm down). The patient calmed down just a little bit in the evening. When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn&#39;t breathe, and his mind was racing. The patient&#39;s other brother went to him and he was not responsive, and he passed away on 06Jan2021 around 10:15 AM. It was reported that none of the symptoms occurred until the patient received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of all of the events was unknown; not responsive was not recovered, the patient died on 06Jan2021. The cause of death was unknown (reported as: not known by reporter). An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and has been requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: not responsive and he passed away

Patient also had mild fever for the last two days and was on Tylenol, blood pressure also remained elevated moderately than the usual readings. Patient was admitted through ER for 2 days and was discharged on 1/24/21, with a diagnosis of possible TIA, Todd&#39;s paresis post seizure. Patient&#39;s CT head and MRI of brain was negative for acute stroke. Patient&#39;s left facial droop and right side facial puffiness resolved over a week but noticed to have right sided pronounced weakness with moderate swelling on right arm. Patient used to eat by himself,but now not able to do so and not able to hold cup in the right hand. Patient was again sent to ER for repeat CAT scan of head, further evaluation and management. Not sure if patient had an adverse reaction to Covid-19 vaccination, but definitely these symptoms were developed after 2 weeks of receiving Pfizer vaccination, which may be coincidental. Patient was followed up by the neurologist a week after the discharge from hospital who couldn&#39;t rule out adverse reaction of vaccination. Patient is awaiting for an EEG, carotid ultrasound and Echo as an out patient.

                                                Within approximately a couple of days from the first of two COVID19 Pfizer injections, I developed a progressive, systemic, neuro/neuro-muscular inflammatory pain response.  The inflammation and pain first manifested in my left wrist and hand, greatly worsening recent symptomology that may have been the start of a carpal tunnel syndrome.  The inflammation and pain then progressed to my right wrist and hand and right shoulder.  Then they progressed to my left shoulder, under my clavicles, my hips,  and my upper lumbar/lower thoracic region of my spine.  Muscle groups tightened and hurt, chief among them my hamstrings and upper back.  All within days.  The inflammation and pain were severe, especially from the early a.m. (3 or 4 in the a.m.) to waking hours.  And the conditions left me nearly debilitated and incapable of sleeping well or performing many ADLs.  Then, on Monday, March 29, 2021, I saw an orthopaedic for the pains in my wrists and hands, and he prescribed me a steroid for a preliminary diagnose of bilateral carpal tunnel.  The inflammation and pain throughout my body decreased considerably after only two doses of the steroids.  That led me to seek a consultation with the rheumatologist.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

I adv try not to drive yourself call back if issues.

                                                had pulmonary embolism in both lungs; blood clots/blood clots in the lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm right on 07Apr2021 at vaccination age of 54 years old (Lot Number: EN6208; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There was no medical history.  No known allergies.  No Covid prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left on 08Mar2021 14:00 at vaccination age of 54 years old (Lot Number: EN6205; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. No other vaccine in four weeks. No other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced had pulmonary embolism in both lungs on 17Apr2021 13:00, blood clots/blood clots in the lungs on 17Apr2021 13:00.  Events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. The patient had pulmonary embolism in both lungs. He was in the hospital for 3 days and now he will have to take blood thinners in definitely. He was admitted 17Apr2021 and discharged home 19Apr2021. He did not have history of blood clots and zero risk factors. Two doctors blamed the vaccine. He did not want to take blood thinners forever. He needed help figuring out how to determine if this was related to the vaccine. He had a reaction to the second shot and he had been in the hospital the last 3 days and the 2 different doctors that saw him said the only thing that was different was that he had received the COVID vaccine. He had blood clots in both of his lungs, he was in serious condition for a couple days there but his biggest concern now was that they were telling him that he will have to take medication forever to thin his blood because they didn&#39;t think there was a genetic reason it happened and that was the protocol that healthcare providers have to follow. They were telling him that he might contact a hematologist and do a blood study but they said they were certain that it came from the vaccine because there was no history of this in his family or himself. He said the condition&#39;s medical term was pulmonary embolism but he just said blood clots in the lungs because he thought he would make it easier to explain. Both doctors that saw him felt it was brought on the by the vaccine. He was not looking to sue or anything, he didn&#39;t want to be taking a blood thinner for the rest of life. He was not doing this for any reason other than to get well. He realized this situation was very rare with Pfizer, it was like 4 in 1 million with Pfizer according to his physicians. Covid tested post vaccination: Nasal Swab on 17Apr2021 with negative result. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of had pulmonary embolism in both lungs, blood clots/blood clots in the lungs. The outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

On 5/6 he answered the Vaccine Questionnaire question of &#34;are you sick today?&#34; as &#34;unsure&#34; and further discussion was had with a pharmacist to verify he was eligible to receive vaccine. Neither the pharmacist or patient remember the details of this discussion.  Patient and wife have belief that his ethnicity contributed to dismissing of possible illness during the vaccine screening process, but due to the patient&#39;s lethargy and brain fog at the time, he could not provide specifics of the conversation. His wife was not with him during the screening process with the pharmacist or during vaccine administration. The appointment time was 4:55pm. The wife states the patient was so fatigued after the shot was administered on 5/6 that he was asleep in his chair in the observation area.  Later that day fever of 100.5 was noted and controlled by OTC ibuprofen 2 hours after the ibuprofen was administered. The wife states that he rapidly declined over the 3 days after second Pfizer vaccine and she called an ambulance on Sunday 5/9. From the ER he was admitted to the ICU with the primary reason for admission listed as hyperglycemia but a COVID was listed as a contributing factor. The COVID test administered Sunday was positive. He had high blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, and sodium. Patients vitals have since stabilized other than the sodium is still high. He is in ICU at hospital still very lethargic as of today 5/10.

Patient was hospitalized for management of severe sepsis secondary to Covid pneumonia resulting in acute hypoxic respiratory failure.  Patient was also treated for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia given duration of Covid symptoms prior to coming into hospital.  Patient made nice recovery and was able to wean off from high flow oxygen down to 2 L with exertion.  Patient overall made nice recovery hence he was discharged home.   Patient was noted to have rising D-dimers despite clinical improvement in Covid infection.  He is at high risk for developing DVTs hence he was recommended to use Xarelto 10 mg daily for 1 month to prevent any risk of DVTs.   Patient voiced understanding of this.  In he was discharged home with home health care.   His readmission potential is low to moderate.

                                                After the 15 minute  post shot waiting period patient said  he felt &#34;confused&#34; with clammy hands.  He sat in the chair and was slow to talk.  I asked him if he was diabetic, and he responded that he was, but he never feels this way and had eaten before coming in.  After talking a while longer, I was going to ask him if he&#39;d like us to check his sugar, he asked me if we had a blood pressure cuff.  I said we did, but he wanted to use the machine in front of the store because he felt well enough to get up and wanted to walk.   I walked to the machine with him.  He sat and answered the many questions tapping on screen with no issues at all.  The confusion was not evident.  The maching reported 111/68 or very close, with a pulse of 48.  He said, &#34;that&#39;s the issue, my pulse is down.  I need to walk around.&#34; I said he could stay back at the pharmacy where we could see him, or we could call someone for him.  He said staying back here would not help his pulse. I told him there was no hurry, he&#39;d been here for his 15 minutes, but we could keep an eye on him or help him and call whatever he needed.  He said no, he&#39;d be fine, he just needed to walk around.  He now had  pressure in his head, not really a headache just pressure, he said it was all related to his pulse. He said if he needed help later he could always go to an Urgent Care, I offered again to call anywhere for him or call for assistance, he was not interested.

Treatment team Acute nonintractable headache, unspecified headache type Clinical impression Headache Chief complaint Triage Note:  To ED c/o severe HA behind R ear since being dx w COVID 4/30. Denies cough, dyspnea, fevers. Reporting he has had 1 round of COVID vaccines. Has taken &#34;alieve, tylenol, and advil&#34; w/o relief. Last doses all &#34;early this morning.&#34; pt awake and alert in triage.   History of Present Illness     Patient is a 54 y.o. yo male presenting to the ED with severe headache behind the right ear since 4/30.  Patient was diagnosed with Covid at that time and has taken 1 round of the Covid vaccine.  He has tried Aleve, Tylenol and Advil without relief.  He states that his last dose were all early this morning.  Denies any numbness or tingling, visual disturbances, ataxia, photophobia.  He has no history of strokes, MI or blood clots.  He states that prior to his Covid diagnosis he is otherwise healthy. ED Discharged  5/8/2021 (4 hours)  Last attending ? Treatment team COVID-19 Clinical impression Fever Chief complaint   Medical Decision Making     54-year-old male who presents today due to uncontrolled fever, diagnosed with Covid on April 30.  Symptomatic for about 2 weeks now.  On exam appears to be uncomfortable, is febrile and tachycardic, however remaining vitals are stable.  Physical exam is also reassuring.  Patient not complaining of any chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness.  Will provide patient with symptomatic relief including fluids and ibuprofen, if able to improve patient&#39;s symptomatology will have him discharged home.  His labs also show some slight hyponatremia, he will likely improve from fluids as I believe this is secondary to his diarrhea that he has been having over the last few days.  CK also slightly elevated, would likely benefit from fluids.   After a single liter of fluids, patient symptoms improved, fever and tachycardia also improved, continues to endorse some generalized weakness, will give second liter of fluid and Tylenol at this time as he is due for this.   After receiving a second liter, the patient states that his symptoms have greatly improved at this time, comfortable returning home.  I advised the patient that she should take ibuprofen and Tylenol on 6-hour cycles very regularly, he can take it in a pattern where he takes Tylenol followed by ibuprofen 3 hours later followed by Tylenol again 3 hours later, as long as he keeps 6 hours in between doses, explained to him that he should not take this any sooner than this however he should be sure to take these regularly as these will help control his fever.  Also encouraged him to hydrate appropriately as this will likely prevent him from feeling poorly.  He is agreeable with this plan, I provided him with appropriate return precautions.

Did not think about the vaccine until two weeks after the second dose I struggle to walk with severe pain in my legs, arms, and hands. Life since has been pretty rough passed out from the pain on May 16th had to have 9 staples in my head. Now my life is trying to balance medication so I can sleep at night. And get through the days at work. I have had to miss days.

Was sleeping 12 plus hours a day without feeling rested in the least. No problems with sleep. Also had heaviness of chest - felt like rib cage made of iron- this dissipated by the 28-29th. No excessive cough or fever, did have dyspnea with any exertion and this continues but seems to be lessening. Was not able to work due to fatigue. Yesterday remained tired but felt noticeably different-felt lighter-and today seems promising.

                                                Diffuse abdominal pain onset approximately 10-12 hr post dose.  I was initially awoken that first night with nausea and abdominal pain. This continued through 1/22/21. My nausea had subsided and I was able to eat in small quantities. My abdomen felt bloat with mild distention. The AM of 1/23/21, I awoke and the diffuse abdominal pain had abated. I was left with RLQ abdominal pinpoint pain. This became progressively worse throughout the day. I presented to the ER on 1/23/21. Chem panel was normal. CBC also normal.   I received an abdominal CT scan with IV contrast for R/O appy. My appendix was normal. The scan revealed a serosal venous thrombophlebitis wth inflammation in the mesentery and transverse colitis.  The pain continued to progress, so I presented to the ER again on 1/25/21.  I received another abdominal CT along with additional lab work.  Lactate normal. D-Dimer mildly elevated at 0.7 and CRP was 9.7. Again CBC was normal. This CT did not reveal the micro-emboli or colits but rather omental inflammation.  At this point, surgery was consulted along with hematology for opinion regarding anticoagulation. The decision to anti coagulate was deferred. The diagnosis I received was omental infarct.  I remain on pain medications and continue to monitor for changes in my pain and a fever.

They took some blood work, CBC panel were  negative, thyroid test, normal, anaiongap, normal, glucose reading, normal and an EKG normal.  2nd episode 01-21-2021 started 11;45am, that morning when i woke up i felt really strong feelings of sadness and despair.  At 11;45a i was about to eat and i started to feel again brain fog, total body weakness, elevated BP, they took my BP again and it was 144/88 so i went to the ER again. I could not keep my eyes open. They did a EKG again with a CTA and a CT with perfusion both were normal. They gave me fluids, sodium fluids. Agian it was transient my BP slowly went down and went home.  Third episode 01-25-2021 started about 9am,  i was at home did not have access to a BP cup, symptoms were same but less intense, i could feel my heart pounding, brain fog and body aches and this lingered throughout the day. It felt like I had the  flu.  No elevated temperature on all three of my episodes.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.  RADIOLOGY DIAGNOSTIC - CHEST PORTABLE 02/04 2051 *** Report Impression - Status: SIGNED  Entered: 02/04/2021 2059 IMPRESSION: 1.

Ill-defined patchy opacities within the bilateral upper lobes, right middle lobe, in consolidative opacities within bilateral lower lobes which could represent aspiration, and/or multifocal pneumonia. 2. Small right trace left pleural effusions. 3. Diffusely dilated small bowel without a transition point and mucosal hyperenhancement involving the colon with areas of pneumatosis involving loops of small bowel within the left upper quadrant and portal venous air consistent with hypoperfusion complex. There is a small caliber appearance of the aorta and a flattened appearance of the IVC is well. 4. Intravascular air within the IVC and bilateral iliac veins could be secondary to right femoral central lying injection. 5. Somewhat abnormal enhancement pattern of the kidneys with hypoenhancement of the medullary pyramids which may suggest hypoperfusion injury as well. 6.

                                                had a feeling of impending death and thought he was gonna die.; Syncopal episode; My platelets counts drop; metallic taste; Potassium level went down; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 55-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248) first dose on 12Feb2021 on Deltoid Left at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Covid-19 and High cholesterol. Concomitant medications were not reported. He said that he was 60 days post COVID and his doctor advised him to get vaccinated. He was feeling fine, but after 10 minutes into the shot, he had a metallic taste in the mouth. After 12-13 minutes, he had a feeling of impending death and thought he was gonna die. It freaked him out. He was rushed to the ER and had a complete blood count (CBC) and Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) test run on him. It was that his Potassium level went down to 3.3 and his platelets dropped to 141. He had tests on 28Jan2021 and mentioned that his Potassium levels were normal and had a platelet count of 181. He mentioned that there was no other way but the vaccine that could have caused this. He is if he would already have passed away from the shot from his opinion. Patient had a Syncopal episode of some type. He had an intended feeling like he was going to die after the shot, he was 60 days post Covid when he get that shot, he was getting over Covid and he was 60 days and he didn&#39;t wait the 90 days his primary doctor care told me that he can get it too because he was feeling better which he was feeling better but since then he have gotten that shot, he went to the doctor on the 28Jan2021 and he had CBC drawn on him and he went for his regular physical and Covid follow-up at his doctor, his platelets counts drop since he have had shot struck at 40 points, feels concerning. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported &#34;feeling of impending death and Syncopal episode &#34; and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient received first dose of Pfizer vaccine 3/24/21. Patient became unsteady and was directed to stretcher. Patient has a hx of HTN and reports not taking his BP medication for &#34;a while.&#34; Patient was unsure what BP medication he was on. Reports potentially taking Lasix and Vit K. Patient reports not eating or drinking prior to receiving the vaccination. Alert and oriented. Denies SOB/chest pain.     Vitals taken at 10:45AM:  BP 197/11  HR 75 SPO2 98% RA   ED rapid response called. Pt unable to stand up from stretcher.   Patient was taken to ED and neurology was consulted.  Neurology noted:  55-year-old man past medical history of hypertension coming with uncontrolled hypertension systolic over 220.  Concern for gait instability, no evidence of strength weakness on any extremity with confrontational testing.  No evidence of change in altered mental status, no evidence of cranial nerve palsy, and no evidence of sensory loss.   No evidence of coordination problems with finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing bilaterally.  He exhibits 5 out of 5 confrontational testing to all extremities muscles as above albeit with giveaway weakness.  NIHSS 0.     Although patient presents within TPA window he has had no disabling symptoms and therefore is not a candidate for TPA.  Although the patient presents with a mechanical thrombectomy window he has no disabling symptoms and no evidence of LVO either on exam or my preliminary read of his CTA head and neck.  As such he is not a candidate for mechanical thrombectomy.   Symptoms do not localize well although patient presents with clear hypertensive urgency versus hypertensive emergency.  Would recommend full medical work-up for this condition as we rule out signs of acute ischemic stroke.   Patient passes dysphagia screen in the ED.  Recommendation: 1. Admit to Observation.  2. MRI brain without contrast 3. Obtain stroke labs A1c, TSH, lipid profile 4. PT OT consult evaluation and treat 5. Social worker and case management consult for stroke work-up

                                                Within 5-minutes of vaccination, the patient reported weakness and confusion. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. No signs of stroke. EKG demonstrated NSR, rate 77bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG was 290mg/dl. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. Enroute, the patient became increasingly confused, forgetting their birthday and location. Patient was hypertensive (178/104) and reported a &#34;crushing headache&#34;. EMS crew became concerned for stroke. In ED, the patient remained hypertensive (178/93). ED Physician had high suspicion of TIA versus acute reaction to COVID-19 vaccine. Administerd 650mg acetaminophen and 1mg Lorazepam. Admitted patient to critical care unit where patient stated they had developed a sudden-onset diffuse banding-like headache with associated nausea, diaphoresis, blurry vision, and confusion. MRI was negative and patient was transferred from ICU to hospital. Hospital physician believed the symptoms were likely a vagal mediated response or reaction to his COVID vaccination. Patient was discharged on 3/20 with diagnoses of TIA, Acute encephalopathy, Insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, Essential hypertension, CAD, Unspecified mood disorder, Dyslipidemia, Obesity, and Mild neuro cognitive disorder

But that 2nd day after, G.I. issues began middle of nite. So fatigued &amp; short-of-breath, barely made it to dialysis, where they put me on oxygen. All during treatment, BP fluctuated 90-170, temp 96-101, chills (shivering!), continued fatigue &amp; weakness, even after leaving - they wanted to give me antibiotics &amp; send me to e.r.!!! Staff did collect blood sample for culture (result in 24 hrs &#43; neg). I refused antibiotics and e.r., convinced it was vax reaction, and I was right, all normal another day later.  Anxious bout 2nd shot ??

                                                I received the vaccine about two - three inches from the center of the muscle and in back of center - it was more in back of deltoid than the front of my deltoid. When I first got the shot, I had a burning sensation from the site of needle to back of neck to behind my ear area. It felt like a burning aching feeling. My ear felt like it was clogged up and aching. I told the medical site about it and the doctor on site said that more likely they hit a nerve. My blood pressure was very elevated. They had me stay to be observed for 45 minutes. I went back to work. I still felt it at night. The next day, I started feeling up my neck and my collarbone and my left side of my face and my head - my face felt tight and my lip felt numb on the left side and I had a slight confusion too. I went to Emergency room. They did CAT Scan and exam. After that, I noticed it was going all the way down my arm, all the left side of my body to toes. It felt like numbness - like neuropathy type feeling. It felt like constant pain. I went to the Urgent Care and they gave me Prednisone steroid (5 days of it) 5 mg to help with inflammation.  I took that for the five days. I started noticing a little black bruising on my body. After that,  I went to the Urgent Care again and they gave me Naproxen  and and Dr gave me more Naproxen to take.  He took bloodwork, too. I went to the ER and I was still feeling sick and hot. They said it was anxiety. I am still going through it - I feel it on the spot where I got the shot - and on my neck and on my head and on my left eye and down on my legs a lot - some days are worse than others but not as bad as when I had the first symptoms.

Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base. He had pain in the base of his right foot. Blood tests were in the second week. Glucose was high and he is hypoglycemic. Glucose 117 mg/dl (79-115 normal range), zinc 54 mcg/dl (60-120 normal range), CMV IGG AB &gt;10 u/mL (positive is &gt; or = 0.7 range). The outcome of the events was unknown.

This 55-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in his left arm on 05Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Arthritis, Sinus problem, Asthma, Bipolar disorder. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date at age of 55 years old for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced injection site pain, severe pain in his left shoulder after that second dose. Some major pain up around his shoulders and around the back of neck, his left side was worst. He said that the pain was shooting down to his heart. So he went to the hospital because he thought it was something to the heart. They tested him, they evaluated him but they ruled out anything that has to do with the heart. They checked his heart, he had a cardiac catheterization, and was ruled out, everything came out negative.  So, he just got out of hospital and was still developing the pain and it&#39;s on his left side, it&#39;s on his right side (as reported). He called all his doctors, they had no answers for him, now he was still in a lot of pain in both of shoulders like he was saying his left side was still the worst, and it has not gone away and the pain is still shooting down around his heart and shooting down around the back of neck and now it&#39;s going on the top of his legs.  He went to the bone doctor and he was getting an MRI done, because the doctors said nothing was torn in his arms or tissues. He stated the pain was around his arms, back and wraps down to the heart. He was in dire pain, 8.5/10 and had a feeling of it was related to the vaccine. He clarified the pain was in both shoulders and the left side was worse and that was the side he had his shot on.  Patient stated he had stomach problems, he was collapsed stomach. The outcome of events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I needed to remove the mask as I was having difficulty with the rapid heart rate and feeling of fainting. I also felt pins and needles type feeling in my legs and my face felt slightly swelled. I felt tired and that tired feeling lasted for the entire day. I stayed at the vaccination site for approximately 30 minutes at the advice of the EMT and went home. Later I had a slight headache but heart rate became more normal.

                                                Mild palpitation; faint feeling; Arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 56-year-old male patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, lot number: EL0140, exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (vaccine location: right arm) on 05Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: Hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no Covid prior to vaccination. On 05Jan2021, 30 min after injection, felt a mild palpitation-stronger than any previous mild ones but not as strong as the strong one he experienced after the first injection, and he had to close his eyes due to the faint feeling. This was followed by a mild one 3 min later. In the next few days, he had several additional mild to weak palpitations. The strong one that he experienced was 12-14 hours after receiving the first dose, did not show. The patient also experienced arm soreness after the first dose (Jan2021). The patient was not Covid tested post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

                                                I was symptom free when I went to bed four hours after vaccination.  In the middle of that first night (03/02/21), I awoke with an overall body ache, which persisted through the next day.  In the morning of the next day (03/03/21), I awoke with soreness at the vaccination site, tightness in my chest, and a swollen, red left ankle.  The overall achiness and sore arm were understandable, but the chest tightness made we wonder if inflammation in the region persisted from my cardiac ablation in May 2020 and was aggravated by the covid vaccine.  I have a Kardia home-test ECG monitor, and the results of the test continue to be &#34;normal.&#34;  As far as the ankle, an MRI in August 2020 determined that I had torn my peroneal brevis tendon.  After six weeks in a walking boot, I began physical therapy and noticed that if I exerted myself too much that I would get swelling and soreness.  Everything in my ankle was healed by October 2020, and I have been hiking / running four times a week since without incident.  I did not injure myself before the vaccination, so it seems to much of a coincidence that inflammation returned to my previously injured ankle just hours after receiving the covid vaccine.

Two days later I started having diffuse sporadic and intermittent tingling on various parts of my body.  That lasted about 2 days in its greatest severity.  On day 6 post vaccine, I was walking in an airport and developed chest pain, tachycardia, and shortness of breath out of proportion to my level of exertion.  This chest pain, shortness of breath and tachycardia with minimal exertion (a flight of stairs.  A walk to the end of driveway.) has persisted since then.  A cardiac w/u with Echo and  treadmill stress ECHO were negative.  I also have intermittent fatigue, headaches, and a mild &#34;brain fog.&#34;

This would be the end of the rib at the center of my chest. I didn?t think much of it at that time. When I woke up around 0600, the pain was throughout the center of my chest. The more I exerted myself, the greater the pain. I also had a headache and neck pain. After 36 hours, I was fine. I didn?t go to the ER as I felt that the problem was muscular. My heart felt fine.

Patient was returned to supine position with legs elevated. He continued to shake and patient lips blue ? sweatshirt placed over him. RN noted that Pts? eyes rolled back in his head. RN went to alert the Clinical Team Manager/RN of the situation and stated that 911 should be called as patient not improving. Clinic Team Manager/RN concurred. While RNs stayed with patient and informed patient?s friend about what would occur, Clinic Site Manager  called 911. BP 140/80 at next check. Patient continued to sweat and have chills. Rescue squad arrived ? blood sugar was 116. After emergency services assessment of patient, emergency services checked blood sugar again and it had dropped to 88 within those ~5 minutes. Patient was taken by Emergency Services at 6:36pm. RN  noted that the patient remained with emergency services in parking lot  for several minutes and then pt was transported to the hospital by the emergency services. His wallet, glasses and hat were given to his friend who had accompanied patient to the vaccination clinic. His friend stated that she would call patient?s wife to inform her that patient was taken to ED by emergency services.

Within 60 seconds of taking the oral diphenhydramine, he stated that he could feel it working and was starting to feel much better. Patient was advised to remain at the pharmacy for further observation but refused (documented). He left with his caregiver.

A 56-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 07Apr2021 14:30 (Lot Number: WR8783) as 1ST DOSE SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing sciatica, back problems, stomach was sensitive, lower back pain, bone spurs down his spine. He was a medical marijuana patient, he had Shigella when he was a baby. He was 2 or 3 and almost died but came out of it; His mom had cancer from smoking, he got the worse flu sick of his life. His stomach was sensitive all of the time. If he was too happy or too nervous get upset. He can eat spicy food, not super hot, but he can eat anything and it doesn&#39;t go crazy. He has a little bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes. He can&#39;t take a multivitamin or supplements because he would get sick to his stomach, this was before the vaccine. He was getting that same sick feeling now that he would get if he was taking a multivitamin. He had his blood drawn a week before he had the vaccine to check his kidneys with the pills he is on. It was perfect and normal, and he has had nothing since then. In his 20s he had the flu vaccine, and he had never had the flu in his life. That year he got the worse flu sick of his life. He never got the flu vaccine or other vaccines after that. That was probably between 1987 to 1990. His folks passed away. He had been in the hospital when he was little.Concomitant medications included acetaminophen taken for back pain, sciatica from an unspecified start date and ongoing; nabumetone taken for sciatica, back pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient experienced he passed out for 2 days (medically significant) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, been sick pretty much everyday (non-serious) on 07Apr2021 22:00 with outcome of not recovered, not feeling good in his stomach (non-serious) on 07Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, slept all day for several days (non-serious) on 08Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, responding strangely to people/but is still there and is so weird (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting (non-serious) on 15Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, his whole torso hurt and his stomach (non-serious) on 15Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, diarrhea (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really irritable (non-serious) on 09Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, he had no energy (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of recovering, he was lethargic/weakness (asthenia) (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, dizzy (non-serious) on 10Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast (non-serious) on 17Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, breathing hard (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, wouldn&#39;t feel good (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, arm started hurting where he got the shot (non-serious) on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, headache (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, his arm was a little sore (non-serious) on 13Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, a fast heartbeat (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, chills (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown. Patient got sick around 10:00 at night. He was supposed to get his second dose but he was so sick and they said lets give it a week. Then he talked to his doctor and he said to wait 2-3 weeks to make sure he is back to normal. So he is scheduled for the second dose next week at 6 weeks. He asked if it was okay that the shot was given in the sunlight. He stated that he saw that it was in an ice chest but the person had to walk it over to him 20 feet and deal with his sleeve for a second or two so it was in the sun. He said all that walking it was 100% in the sun and he has read that it should not be in the sun. He asked if this could have caused bacteria and caused his symptoms. He stated his doctor was only concerned about giving him antibiotics for bacteria if it was in the sun and if that was a problem. He just read from CDC, once mixed the vaccine can be left at room temp for 6 hours and mixed vaccine does not need to be protected from light. So it sounds like his first shot was good. He had gotten the shot at about 1430 in the afternoon. He was like he is going to get the shot and everything will be great. He didn&#39;t think there would be an effect. Then strangely enough at about 2200 he was about to eat dinner and he got to not feeling good in his stomach. It had been close to 8 hours. The next day he slept all day, got up and had coffee, and Saturday he was in the chair in the living room. He is never in the chair during the day because he works. He slept all day and all night and the next day. He was responding strangely to people, and he was in and out of it. He had the shot on Wednesday and then his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting. He has back pain anyway and bone spurs on his spine. He was telling his wife whatever pain he is normally in was enhanced. His whole torso hurt and his stomach. The following Monday he had diarrhea. Then he started getting really irritable and didn&#39;t want to talk and was impatient. He was lethargic and had no energy. That was the second week. By the end of the second week he had a couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast. He thought it was a heart attack, then thought it was just pain not a heart attack. Every time he wouldn&#39;t feel good he would start breathing hard. Once in a while he gets pain through his chest area. His stomach would start and he would breath hard every time he didn&#39;t feel good. The third week he was supposed to get the second shot. He called the department of health for New Mexico. The nurse called back and said not to do the shot that week but to wait a week. He rescheduled for a week later. By the third week he was still not feeling good and called the doctor. He asked about the pain in his chest 3 times and he said it seemed to be okay. His arm started hurting where he got the shot in the second week. He still had no energy and he told the doctor this. Patient started taking 2 extra Tylenol during the day for pain. Lately he has been good until one little thing and then all of a sudden his stomach is hurting and he is holding his stomach. He was good today, all he did was eat a cookie and he didn&#39;t get sick. He was worse for a little while in the first or second week, he was really bad. It came and went over the next 2 weeks and now it is coming and going less frequently. He slept through 2 or 3 days. Thursday, Friday, and then Saturday he was in and out. He woke up to take the garbage out on Friday then saw he already took it out and forgot it was out there. And it was Saturday. He was kind of out of it. When he would respond strangely he would respond with a question he just asked and someone answered. It is like brain fog or like he is on something. It started after the weekend, more on 12Apr2021. Once in a while he will forget a little something still, but just once in a while. He would walk and hold his rib cage with both arms when he was hurting. He wrote down that it felt like somebody had hit him in the back with a bat in the lower back. One day it was that bad. His back pain was on Thursday 15Apr2021. The pain now is not like where it hit him with the back. He has back pain every day but more than he used to. The sore like he was hit in the back pain was just the one day. He had diarrhea 12Apr2021, 13Apr2021, and 14Apr2021 then it left for probably a week. Then it came back last week one day. Instead of every day it was every 3 or 4 days. He has not had it in the last 4 days. He hopes it is done. He noticed any time he has salad or lettuce he feels bad in the morning so he stopped eating those. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. The irritable feeling started right away the Friday of the week he got the shot. He is still struggling some, it will come and go. Yesterday he was zonked. With having no energy it is a big thing. He has to do something instead of what he would be doing. He works all day and takes long orders and stuff. Now he does like one order when normally he did 10. One for him is a huge little sore so he will lay on his right side. His left arm still hurts like a pulling hurt from his neck to his arm. It has been every day from 13Apr2021. It is much better and he will move and it will relax a little bit. It was really weird. The whole time he held the phone with his left hand up until one second he moved his phone and it was the same pain. At night the left side where he had the injection pulls on his neck muscle coming from his arm. He was actually taking two Tylenol in the morning and two at night when he went to bed. With the pain he takes 2 during the day, 650mg each. He was just taking 500mg and then his wife said take these. It seems to have gotten a little better. He always took them 2 times a day and now he takes them 3 times a day. After the first dose he experienced difficulty breathing dizziness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, chills, nausea, headache, he passed out for 2 days and has been sick for 5 weeks. He started having some dizziness a couple of days later and reports, it&#39;s like I would stand up too quickly and get a head rush, that kind of dizzy feeling. He confirmed that his dizziness did not start until a couple of days after he received his first dose.

A 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11May2021 10:30 (at the age of 56 years old) (Lot Number: EW0182) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, allergies: contrast dye. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were not any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient reported that there was a slight discomfort of the arm where the shot was administered (11May2021) - not enough to worry about &amp; expected.  The next morning (12May2021) he felt painful sensations in the lower left leg - sensations similar to stress fractures and palpations. It subsided and has not returned. About three/four days later (reported as 14May2021 18:00) continuing two weeks leading to the second dose - he felt a constant and migrating thrombosis/palpitations on the right side of his head. It was mildly painful - not quite a headache yet persistent and localized to the RT temporal lobe above the temple &amp; slightly above that region. It became exacerbated by critical thinking when it occurred &amp; persisted for long periods of time. The cognitive effect has become slightly debilitating &amp; stressful. No treatment received. The outcome of the event &#39;a slight discomfort of the arm where the shot was administered&#39; was unknown, of the event &#39;painful sensations in the lower left leg&#39; was recovered, of the other events was not recovered.

                                                24 hours after the second vaccine I had crushing, tightness in my chest. It felt like a myocardial infarction. It lasted 24 hours. I had difficulty doing my job. I considered going to the ER to rule out a myocardial infarction not related to the vaccine. I also had bone pain in right forearm and hand which lasted 24 hours. In addition, I had muscle pain in my entire upper body but not lower body. On day 2 I had right axillary swelling and pain.

Patient states 2 days ago, he had to take his dog to the vet, and they accidentally ran away; he had to run &#34;full tilt&#34; to catch it, which caused him to become acutely short of breath.

He has been using albuterol several times per day (3-4 times today), as well as his BiPAP machine that he uses for OSA, during the day without relief.  Denies chest pain, though he has chest tightness associated with difficulty breathing.  History of similar difficulty breathing with exertion during the winter, but never this bad; has not been hospitalized or intubated for RAD.  Got his second COVID vaccine 3 days ago, after which he had fevers, now resolved.  Denies recent antibiotics; no history of COPD, slight cough today, not productive of sputum, no hemoptysis.  Reports a month of right leg swelling; has a history of prior right knee surgeries; no posterior calf pain, no acute changes; no history of VTE, no history of cancer, no hemoptysis, no recent procedures/surgeries/immobilizations.

                                                On  January 8,  I started having a cramping feeling in my right calf. It went on throughout the day without a event.   I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

                                                I had my first shot of Pfizer vaccine last Friday morning (March 5). In the evening, I felt fatigued. So I went to sleep early. When I got up Saturday morning, I felt dizzy. The dizziness went away in a few minutes. In the next 36 hours, I had the angina feelings - tightness in the left chest and I felt heart be squeezed occasionally. When I stand up and walk, I felt better. Finally Sunday evening (March 7), I took a walk outside and felt symptom free. Maybe the walk helped, maybe the &#34;thrombosis&#34; had run its course before my walk.   I have not had the severe angina symptoms since my PCI procedure in Feb 2018. I am sure the recent occurrence is related to the vaccine.   Besides reporting the adverse event, I want to get advices whether I should receive the second shot.   Thank you!

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) on 14Jan2021 (at the age of 57 years; as reported) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) on 28Dec2020 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had a stroke on 01Feb2021 at 15:00. The event resulted to  emergency room/department visit and physician office visit but was not given any treatment (as reported). The patient was hospitalized for stroke for 27 days. The event was considered serious, life threatening, and disabling/incapacitating. Patient&#39;s nasal swab test on an unspecified date was negative. The outcome of stroke was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on know n drug profile  it is unlikely that the reported cerebrovascular accident was causally  related to  BNT162B2.  This is probably an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product and on the conduct of the study are evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 48 hours after vaccination, I experienced sudden onset of tachycardia (heart rate ~130-150) which continued into the morning (April 1st 2021). The tachycardia transitioned into atrial flutter (confirmed by an EKG in the cardiologists office that afternoon)  with associated shortness of breath (secondary to the cardiac arrhythmia).  I had a cardio version that afternoon (4/1/2021, 4:00pm)  and converted to normal sinus rhythm. I was given a rhythm and rate modifier medication and anticoagulant.   Prior to the COVID vaccination,  I had been symptom free for 3 years from my atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

A 57-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 57-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included joint pain and ongoing 45-packs per year smoker. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), hydroxyzine (manufacturer unknown) and diclofenac sodium (manufacturer unknown). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The physician reported, &#34;patient had anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema on separate hospitalization (I was not involved for this but reviewed photos and this was reportedly attributed to the vaccine; I&#39;m uncertain if that event was reported). On hospitalization, the patient was with small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism on a CT PE (CT scan for Pulmonary Embolus). Patient is an active smoker. No other obvious cause.&#34; As a result of the adverse events (unspecified), the patient was hospitalized for one day. The start date of the events was on 29Mar2021. The patient was treated with apixaban (for pulmonary embolism). The clinical outcome of &#34;anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema&#34; and &#34;small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism&#34; was resolving.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for events pulmonary embolism, anaphylactic reaction and associated generalized rash and generalized erythema. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Patient was found down on 4/25/2021 for an unknown amount of time and EMS was called. Patient noted to be seizing on EMS arrival. Blood glucose was noted to be 32 and an amp of D50 was administered. Patient arrested, received CPR (approximately 1 round) and was intubated in the field. His second glucose reading was undetectable and he received a second amp of D50. Patient also received sodium bicarb, calcium, and epinephrine and transported to ED. Patient subsequently transferred to Medical Center. He was treated for septic shock. His mentation remained very poor after pressors weaned off and sedation stopped. He likely had severe brain injury from hypoglycemia and anoxia - poor brainstem reflexed but did have spontaneous breathing - very poor prognosis - patient was extubated for comfort measures and all interventions stopped after family discussion and per their plan.

                                                Within just a couple minutes, I felt tightness in my chest.  A few minutes later I felt tightness in my throat.  This is the same affect I have when I breath in cooked, steaming mushrooms on pizza or other cooked foods. I informed a nurse nearby about it and she had another nurse  come over and talk to me.  They asked  me if I wanted to go to the Emergency Room at the hospital and I declined, thinking it would subside, and because I was there with a woman whom I am one of her home care providers.. I did relaxation exercises and drank water to relax and it helped a little but after leaving, I went to a pharmacy and purchased Benadryl and took a 20ml dose.  Within about 30 minutes I was feeling better and the next day my chest felt fine but my throat still bothered me; I assumed my throat muscles were still sore from the swelling.

                                                difficulty breathing; face was flushed; heart rate went up; Wheezing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 57-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 57 years, on 26Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0170) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included autoimmune thyroiditis, allergies, hay fever, allergies to grasses, cheese and weeds; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHYROXIN) taken for autoimmune thyroiditis, start and stop date were not reported and an unspecified Antihistamine. The patient stated that 45 minutes later (26Apr2021) he stated that his face was flushed, his heart was beating fast, he was wheezing and had difficulty breathing but, not severe. He states that these conditions were not serious enough to seek medical attention and reports that they were gone by the end of the next day. The patient reported 5 hours after shot at his symptoms were at about 50 percent of what they were, By the next morning, they were down to about 10 percent and by the end of the day, on 27Apr2021, they were gone. The patient would like to know if this will keep him from getting his second dose of the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included heart rate: increase on 26Apr2021. The outcome of the events was recovered on 27Apr2021.

On 23Mar2021, the patient experienced event COVID-19 (hospitalization, medically significant). On 06Apr2021, the patient had COVID-19 pneumonia (medically significant and hospitalized). On 06Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 6 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalized due to pneumonia and remained hospitalized at the time of reporting. The patient was also hospitalized in 23Mar2021 for COVID. Since 06Apr2021, the patient remained hospitalized due to COVID. On 16Apr2021, the patient had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID, AHRF secondary to Influenza B exacerbating PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (acute respiratory failure, hospitalized, medically significant), pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) exacerbation, AHRF (acute hypoxemic respiratory failure) secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, pHTN treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hospitalized and medically significant), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (influenza, hospitalized), volume overload (fluid overload, hospitalized). On 16Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 16 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalised due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID and for AHRF secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, then transferred to the other hospital with volume overload and diuresis. The patient was presented with volume overload and needed oxygen requirement (none needed at home prior to both hospitalizations). The patient&#39;s breathing and oxygen were improved with diuresis. Patient&#39;s pulmonary hypertension was treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus. Patient was given intravenous (IV) solumedrol (25 mg in AM and 16 mg in PM) as per the discussion with rheumatology and pulmonary hypertension cardiology with improvement in oxygen status. On 24Apr2021, the patient relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included: complete blood count (CBC) WBC (white blood count) 4.79, RBC (Red blood cell count) 3.31, Hgb (hemoglobin) 8.4, Plt (Platelet count) 146. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) Na (sodium) 141, K (potassium) 4.1, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 39, Creatinine 1.68, glucose 90. On 25Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.51, RBC 3.24, Hgb 8.2, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 39, Creatinine 1.59, glucose 117. On 26Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.41, RBC 3.30, hgb 8.3, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 37, creatinine 1.54, and glucose 90. The patient was discharged on 26Apr2021. Patient&#39;s physical exam at the time of discharge showed pulse 65 bpm, respiratory rate 18 per minute, blood pressure (BP) 138/78 mmHg, temperature 36.5 °C and weight was 90.9 kg. The patient was breathing comfortably in no distress on 2 Litre nasal cannula (NC). Minimal crackles appreciated in the morning posteriorly. The patient had 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs and edema unchanged but overall leg size decreased. Continues to be pitting but improved on the day of discharge. Patient&#39;s discharge diagnosis pulmonary hypertension exacerbation. Patient&#39;s diuretics were increased from 40 mg daily to 60 mg daily and may needed more diuretics. Discharge medications included: Protonix (pantoprazole), Demadex (torsemide), Medrol (methylprednisolone), Citracal &#43; d (calcium citrate, ergocalciferol), Lanoxin (digoxin), Epipen (epinephrine), Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), Folvite (folic acid), Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine sulfate). Patient&#39;s medications of Pepcid, Lasix, and Aldactone were stopped after discharge from the hospital. The patient was instructed to take pantoprazole 40 mg daily while on steroids and when steroids tapered, he had to discontinue it in future and would stop pantoprazole and resume taking home dose of famotidine. Patient was on nifedipine at home and physician thought to be the contributing factor to lower extremity edema so stopped taking the nifedipine in house. It was reported that steroid induced the diabetes. It was reported that the patient needs transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) due to had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) but not agreeable at that time. The patient tried ethacrynic acid 50 mg daily but felt it was not making a difference with his weight. The patient went back on the Bumex (bumetanide) on Friday. Patient&#39;s weight slowly coming down to see doing good later on Bumex, his rash subsiding and leg was healing. Patient&#39;s weight was stable at 155 lbs and had multifactorial stable shortness of breath (SOB). Patient&#39;s weight was above baseline and needed more diuretics. Patient had been in touch with his COVID positive brother who was symptomatic and refused to be covid testing quarantining at that time. On 24Feb2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 °F. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, CI 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight since discharge from the hospital. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose due to the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was updated to dose decreased and for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with nifedipine, and Medrol dose for the events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with COVID-19 Vaccine was not applicable. The outcome of the events of rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events of pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unreported date in 2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect products was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.   Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia, and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available,The casual association between the reported events and suspected vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The medical examiner told us that prior to the second vaccine in the last few weeks he had suffered some sort of heart issue that damaged his heart, but wasn&#39;t big enough for him to notice or think anything of it. The timeline the medical examiner gave us would have been after receiving the first vaccine. He then received his second Vaccine on a Thursday which was the last time anyone heard from him and he didn&#39;t show up to work Friday and was found Saturday after we were notified he didn&#39;t show up to work and we called 911. The medical examiner said he suffered a heart attack. The medical examiner said they had to write the death date on Saturday because that was when he was found, but the last anyone heard of him was prior to getting the vaccine and then he missed work the very next day(which was Friday).

I was already not feeling my best that morning symptoms of warmness at home no fever , I checked. No issues with vaccine given approximately 0715, until 1005 am after a very busy morning with nothing but coffee to drink. As I sat down to assist in order entry in our chemo clinic I suddenly became aware of a very rapid heart rate. I realized that I was having a vaso-vagal response and started perspiring lightly and realizing I was having drop in blood pressure. I composed myself removed my mask and breathed slowly and drank cold water while sitting. After a few minutes I was able to slow my heart rate and felt secure enough to leave the pharmacy. I slowly walked and controlled my breathing and continued to drink water. I was able to return to work and continued until the end of the day. I felt somewhat fatigued until bedtime that evening. Slept reasonably well that night and had no other symptoms to my memory the following day.

                                                Heart rate increased; Swelling arm; Arm soreness; soreness at the vaccine injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 13:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) at an unspecified dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was reported as &#34;no pre-existing conditions.&#34; He mentioned that he reviewed his allergies with a pharmacist prior to vaccination but did not specify what his allergies were. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was a tobacco user from an unknown date. The patient also reported a history of pneumonia which was reported to have occurred on seven different occasions following each of seven different vaccinations with the flu vaccine (manufacturers unknown) prior to 2013. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. He stated that after receiving the COVID 19 Vaccine he had side effects. He said the side effects went away at twenty four hours later, but he is still having one side effect, and has a concern. He clarified that he has an elevated heart rate since getting the COVID 19 Vaccine. He said he has never had an elevated heart rate before getting the COVID 19 Vaccine. He reported his heart rate is normally low, between 62-65. He said when he was at work on 28Dec2020 his heart rate was OK, but prior to going to bed that night his heart rate was 93 - 95. He said he thought at first he was just stressed. He also reported the COVID 19 Vaccine is the only thing he has taken. He mentioned that his heart rate has been down to 93, but then up to 105, and higher. He specified that he first presented with an elevated heart rate between 4:00 5:00PM on Tuesday, 29Dec2020. He said the elevated heart rate subsided enough for him to sleep later that day. He said he then started work around 10:00AM today, 30Dec2020, and felt the elevated heart rate in himself, and didn&#39;t say anything to anyone at work. He said when his heart rate got bad, it was about 12:30PM today and that today (30Dec2020) at work he didn&#39;t feel right at lunch, so he took his oxygen level and heart rate. He said his heart rate was 141. He said he called his primary care doctor, but didn&#39;t go to the emergency room. He said he doesn&#39;t have chest pain. He said he said something about his heart rate to a staff member at work, and the staff member tested his heart rate, and told him it was 141. He said he spoke to the nurse at his doctor&#39;s office, and the nurse said the doctor couldn&#39;t do much, and that he could go to emergency room or their practice&#39;s urgent care that is open until 7:00PM.  He said he tried to go to the hospital emergency room, but ended up driving by because the hospital was so busy they were triaging patient&#39;s in the parking lot. The patient also experienced arm swelling and arm soreness following the vaccination on 28Dec2020. He said he could feel the soreness at the vaccine injection site when he moved his left arm. He stated that the swelling was down to his biceps and it resolved within 12- to 14 hours after the vaccination. As treatment, the patient took a generic 81 mg Baby Aspirin (UPC Number: 050428323922, Lot Number: P110657 Expiration Date: May2020) on 30Dec2020 between 3:00 and 3:30. The patient stated that the generic 81mg baby aspirin was an expired product. The clinical outcome of heart rate increased was not recovered and the clinical outcome of arm swelling, arm soreness and vaccination site soreness was recovered on 28Dec2020.

Later in that same morning the swelling starting going down, so I waited to go to the emergency room...did not want to spend the money for all of the tests. I woke up the next morning and still had heart pain, so I decided to go to emergency room .

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He was acutely distressed. He was treated with IV benadryl and IM epinephrine. The difficulty swallowing resolved, but chest tightness persisted. Trial of nitroglycerin did not improve his pain so pt was given IV hydromorphone. After approximately 10 minutes he was  relaxed and breathing comfortably, but still endorsing chest pain.

Pt returned to work 03/01/2021 then checked into urgent care the following day d/t worsening symptoms. Patient Plan written by PAC: &#34;At this time the nature of your pain is not clear. Your cardiac enzymes are within normal limits except for myoglobin which often goes up with skeletal muscle pain. Your BNP test which can come up with congestive heart failure is elevated slightly from your normal.  We will want to recheck this in a week or so. Differential diagnoses could be skeletal muscle pain/injury, herpes zoster or shingles. (This can sometimes have sharp nerve type pain that will develop into a rash within the first 7 days.) Your rapid COVID test was negative.  We are sending a PCR test out just to confirm.  While awaiting test results please isolate at home. We will call you soon as results are back. Refer to Mendocino County&#39;s packet/isolation order. Your potassium level is low at 3.2.  It should be 3.6. We gave you some potassium to take in the clinic.  I am going to give you some to take for an additional few days. When you follow-up next week plan to have your labs redrawn.&#34; Plan Orders: SARS-CoV-2 RNA (COVID-19), QUALITATIVE NAAT to be performed. URIC ACID to be performed. The patient had the following medication order(s) completed today: Potassium Chloride 40meq PO; Toradol 15mg IVP.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

                                                Syncope episode; Lightheaded; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable nurse. A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscularly on 19Mar2021 at 13:00 (01:00 PM) (Batch/Lot Number: ep6955) at the age of 58-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. There was no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history and patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced lightheaded/syncope episode on 19Mar2021 at 13:15 (01:15 PM). The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. It was unknown if the patient received treatment for the events. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported event syncope episode cannot be completely ruled out given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

It was a level of disorientation I have never experienced before in my lifetime.  I fainted one time and was having extreme difficulty getting my bearings and walking and was simply in total &#34;mental disarray&#34;.  I was having difficulty producing words, a prolonged stutter, you might say.  I was shaking.  The local paramedics came and I was taken to the local ER.  Because I was having difficulty speaking, the paramedics (and later the physicians) thought I might have had a TIA.  An MRI on 04/07/2021 at 5pm produced a negative result.  So i can only attribute my reaction to the vaccine.  It was very significant, and i thought it made sense to report it.

                                                passed out/unconscious; feel weak; dizzy; not normal; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 26Mar2021 09:45AM (Lot Number: ER8730) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no other medical history or known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not have COVID test post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. After taking the vaccine the patient waited for 15 minutes prior to departing the facility in order to make sure there was no adverse reactions. At approximately 10:15 10:30 AM the patient drove back home. After driving for about five minutes while stopped at a traffic light the patient completely passed out at 10:45, he was unconscious for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, almost crashed his car and EMT support had to be called. The patient regained his conscience but it took him over a half hour to feel 50% better. Until 8:30 PM 26Mar2021, the patient still felt weak and dizzy and not normal. No treatment was received for events. The outcome of events was recovering.

I had not been able to keep down food in 10 days and for 3 days could not keep down liquids, so I went to the E/R. Pulse was down to 37bpm.  Blood had a high clotting factor as was starting to clot. Every nerve in my body felt like it was being electrified while on Fire at the same time!  Acute pain in my heart - Thought I was having a heart attack. High fever with chills and sweats.  Extreme dehydration.  And my kidneys hurt like hell.  They are taxed working overtime.   I was in such extreme pain, they had to shoot me up with Morphine every 4 hours to get it under control. They had to administer blood thinners to prevent clots.  I&#39;m still on blood thinners thanks to this damn vaccine! I was so dehydrated, they gave me 5 bags of IV Saline, a picture of Ice,  a picture of Water, then a picture of Tea, before I could even urinate.    I got to the E/R just in time before my heart stopped,  or before a clot formed and killed me.  Was in the hospital for 2 days.    I&#39;m home now, but still in pain.  I can&#39;t eat but force myself to drink liquids.  I do know if I will be getting any more vaccines...

                                                Initial symptom was swollen lymph nodes in left armpit--where I got the shot. I am informed enough to know this means I had active antibodies that recognized the virus and attacked it. This lasted approximately 4 days.  After day 2, this began where I am today; occasional vertigo/loss of balance with persistent high blood pressure/headaches consistent with when I contracted Covid 11/2020. I have been to my primary doctor twice. The possibility of this being a vaccine reaction has never come up. It is as if I have the headache/blood pressure portion of Covid infection all over again.    There is no outcome yet. Having read other people&#39;s comments, it is a waste of time and money to get diagnostic tests, and physicians are guessing. No thank you,  I learned of these symptoms and this website from the many internet forums (one is listed above) where people are discussing their vaccine reactions. I never wanted this vaccine, but there is considerable pressure to get vaccinated, even when you contracted the virus. I feel vaccine passports are going to be forced on people. I regret the decision to do this.  My second shot is scheduled for 4/30, but I am cancelling it, I am certain this is Covid vaccine related. I am a very healthy and physically fit 58 year old that eats well. Don&#39;t drink, don&#39;t smoke, mainly vegetarian diet.

A 58-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8734) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:00 at age of 58-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It also stated the patient was one of the most vulnerable against virus so he took the Covid-19 Vaccine. Medical history included ongoing cardiac failure congestive diagnosed probably 10 years ago, ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed probably 20 years ago, ongoing dialysis for 3.5 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing unspecified blood thinner. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t take any blood pressure medications and that she knew the patient took a blood thinner. Caller unable to provide further detail for the patient&#39;s medications as she doesn&#39;t have the patient&#39;s list of medications with her. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EP7534) injected in left arm in Mar2021 at age of 58-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fatigue after the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that it was hard to determine the cause of the fatigue because the patient was on dialysis, but that the patient has been more fatigued since he received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was a compromised fellow with a host of pre-existing conditions as far as heart disease, diabetes, and dialysis. Caller was calling in regard to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she was calling to report a bad reaction that her husband, the patient, received on Sunday, 04Apr2021, following his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Approximately 3 hours after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient had a full blown seizure at 15:00 on Sunday, 04Apr2021. Caller reported that she had to call emergency responders following the patient&#39;s seizure. The patient was doing better but the experience with his seizure was quite traumatic. Caller stated that if it was going to happen, it was going to happen to us. About 3 hours after receiving his Covid-19 vaccine on 04Apr2021, the patient became real sluggish and his speech started getting slow before the seizure occurred. Caller reported that the patient made a gradual descent downwards. Caller reported that she swears the patient has not been the same as far as fatigue goes since the patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior. Caller reported that she thought the fatigue was maybe from dialysis. The patient started to get slow just before the seizure, about 2.5 hours after he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was laying down following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s breathing was off. The patient&#39;s breath was heavier. Caller reported that after she noticed the patient&#39;s breathing was off, she asked the patient if he was ok. Caller reported that this is when she noticed that the patient&#39;s speech was really slow and that he was experiencing confusion. The patient has had no more seizure activity. The patient was still being monitored in the hospital. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t remember any of it. It&#39;s hard to say if the patient&#39;s sluggishness and fatigue were ongoing. Caller reported that she couldn&#39;t go see the patient while he was in the hospital but that the patient&#39;s voice sounds much stronger. For Confusion and Speech: Caller reported that the patient seems to be back/ returned to normal. Caller reported that she knew that the patient&#39;s cardiologist went to see the patient. The patient&#39;s cardiologist said that there was nothing that happened to the patient&#39;s heart, that what the patient experienced was not a heart issue, and that the event had no effect on the patient&#39;s heart. The medical staff stated that the seizure the patient experienced was related to a blood pressure drop. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s blood pressure was very low on 04Apr2021. The patient required a visit to Emergency Room for event seizure, no visit of physician office. Admitted on Sunday, 04Apr2021 for seizure, and still hospitalized. For investigations: Caller reported that the medical staff at the hospital definitely did lab work but she was not sure if any imaging was performed. Caller reported that she has no results available for tests that were performed. The outcome of events confusion and &#34;speech started to get slow&#34; was recovered in Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021380129 same patient, different product(dose)/event

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 10Mar2021 at 16:30 (batch/lot number: EN6208) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (wanted the protection). Medical history included deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from Jul2018 and ongoing. No family medical history relevant to the adverse events. Concomitant medication included warfarin taken for maintenance level for history of DVT from Aug2020 and ongoing. The patient experienced DVT in right leg on 02Apr2021, swelling in right leg on 15Mar2021 and discomfort in right leg while walking on 15Mar2021. The patient reported that he had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and he believes that it was directly related to the COVID-19 vaccine. He reported that he has a history of blood clots in his right leg going back to 2018. He reported that his most recent DVT was in Aug2020 and he was cleared in Nov2020. He reported that he received the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Mar2021. He reported that on 15Mar2021, he started to notice his right leg swelling. He reported that he called his physician on 29Mar2021 and that his physician ordered an ultrasound. He reported that he had the ultrasound on 02Apr2021 and a deep vein thrombosis was found again. Swelling in right leg: he reported that the swelling has gone down. He reported that the reason that he mentioned that he has a history of blood clots was because of his warfarin dosage. He reported that he was first diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis in Jul2018. He reported that he went through that cycle and that his maintenance level of warfarin was maybe 10 or 12 mg of warfarin per day. He reported that he had another deep vein thrombosis in Aug2020, and since Aug2020 he has been on 17 mg of warfarin daily. He reported that the blood level on warfarin maintenance was supposed to be between 2 and 2.5. He reported that now because of the deep vein thrombosis he experienced in Aug2020, his doctor wanted his level to be at 2.5 to 3.5. He stated that he doesn&#39;t think that at that blood level for his warfarin that he should have gotten a blood clot. He reported that something compromised or interfered with the warfarin, resulting in a deep vein thrombosis. Discomfort when walking: he reported that it feels like his leg was compressing. He reported that the discomfort seems to have gotten better. He was queried for details of warfarin prescription. He reported that the 10 or 12 mg warfarin tablets that he had been taking when the blood clot was diagnosed in Aug2020 have been consumed and he no longer has the bottle. He reported that he did not have the bottle with him for his current warfarin prescription. He reported that the warfarin was not auto-refilled by the pharmacy. He reported that the warfarin was only prescribed a week or two at a time. Investigations: he reported that since Aug2020 when the deep vein thrombosis returned, he started doing self INR tests at home. He reported that he constantly self-monitors his INR at home and his levels were consistently at 3.0 to 3.1. He reported that he monitors his INR at least once a week, sometimes twice a week depending on how he feels. He reported that sometimes his INR goes over 4 and he can feel it. He reported that his system was a little off when it feels too high so he knows how to adjust. He reported that he last checked his INR today, 15Apr2021, and that it was 4.0. He reported that he typically checks his INR on Wednesday. He reported that he keeps a log of his INR levels. He reported that he did not see his physician on 29Mar2021, but that he called his physician and his physician wrote a prescription for the caller to get an ultrasound. Vaccination facility type was pharmacy. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He reported that he doesn&#39;t usually get vaccines. BNT162B2 second dose (lot number: ER5729) was administered on an unspecified date; anatomical location: left arm. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 58-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Right on 04Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6203) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE, dose 2, administered in Arm Left on 04Mar2021 (Lot Number: EP6955) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included Stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma, Shellfish (rash), Peanuts (rash) and rash. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication(s) included cetuximab; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN); atorvastatin; cholecalciferol; levothyroxine.  The patient experienced large pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade physiology on 01Apr2021. Malignancy and infection were ruled out by cytology which showed only mesothelial cells; cultures were negative. The adverse event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Pericardiocentesis treatment received. The patient hospitalized for 6 days. The patient underwent nasal swab COVID test negative on 08May2021. The outcome was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported &#39;large pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade physiology&#39;, occurred 28 days after bnt162b2 vaccination, is considered unrelated to bnt162b2 but more likely an intercurrent medical condition. Patient&#39;s underlying malignancy, concurrent medical condition for which levothyroxine was administered, concomitant medication cetuximab may have contributed to reported event.

At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.

On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January.

I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician&#39;s Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.  Note however I move around very often during a work day and operate a farm tractor and have an active life style.  I have not recently had any extended trips more than 2 hours nor have I flown within the past year or so.

                                                Approximately 60 seconds prior to emergency, patient felt a sense of panic (first time ever).  Stated to me (wife) &#34;I feel like I am having a panic attack&#34; as we walked on to a parking garage elevator at 12:30 pm on 1.22.21.  As I turned to push the button to go down, leaned against the wall of the elevator. His eyes fluttered and back, he was a little pale.  When I turned around, again, he fainted and fell face down on the elevator floor.  He never stopped breathing and had no convulsions.  He was out for less than 30 seconds. When he came to, he got up by himself with minimal assist from me (911 was already on their way).  He did not remember saying that he felt like he was having a panic attack; but he remember the fear/panic he felt just prior to.  He was oriented x3.  I had him smile, stick his tongue out and speak to make sure it was not a TIA or stroke and there were no symptoms of that.  His bladder did release.  He went by ambulance to the ER (we were on a mini vacation to celebrate his birthday). They did a CAT scan, checked his blood sugar twice, EKG twice, complete blood work panels and urinalysis  All tests were either normal or negative.  They found nothing.  His BP was normal for the first 30 minutes at the hospital, then increased.  But has been normal ever since (he checks it daily). Absolutely no other symptoms since that episode.  He met with our PCP on 1.29.21 as a follow-up and she directed us to complete this form. She has ordered a consult with a Neurologist and that is scheduled for 3.10.21.  His second shot for the vaccine is due on 2.9.21.

                                                I have had a weekly routine of fasting one day a week for the last 20 years. Sometimes I would extend this to 3 days, water only. I am healthy, 6&#39;1&#34; weight 170-180 all of my adult life. Resting HR &lt;56. 9 days after having my first vaccination, I did a 24 hour fast. I woke at 2 am to go to the bathroom. I became lightheaded and passed out while standing over the toilet. I layed on the floor for over 5 minutes with my head spinning. I then realized I was hypoglycemic. I have never had this issue. I took some orange juice and recovered my strength. I hit my head on the top of the toilet which required my to have 5 sutures in my chin at the ER that night.  Today I was working out for 30 minutes on an elliptical. I work out 4 to 5 times weekly.  10 minutes after returning to my room I noticed I was dizzy and checked my pulse from my watch. My HR was 210. this lasted for over 10 minutes. I have never had this issue.   I believe it would not be in my best interest to take the second vaccination.

                                                Immediate after the shot i had a weird taste  and slight feeling of nausea  which soon went away. Around 6 pm on the day of the injection I noticed that my taste buds were more sensitive. Following that I became very sluggish. So I went to bed shortly afterwards. The following morning I was still sluggish and there was a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. The feeling of tiredness an no energy started and continued until Wednesday the 3rd of March.  That morning I awaken feeling better. I still have a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. But overall I feel great.

I then received a second dose (Lot # EN6206) on 3/13/21.  Over that weekend the pain in my leg grew worse and the leg began to swell. on 3/15, I went to my primary care physician who said it looked like a blood clot. He sent me to a radiologist for an ultrasound (?) of the leg. After confirming the clot, I went to a local ER. They started me on Eliquis to treat the clot

                                                Developed Left lower extremity DVT 24 hours after vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable Physician.   A 59-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number not provided), via an unknown route, on 24Mar2021 (at the age of 59-year-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM) and hyperlipidemia (HLD). The patient did not have history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and no other risk factors. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 before vaccination. No relevant concomitant medications were provided. She developed left lower extremity DVT 24 hours after vaccine, on 25Mar2021. The event required emergency room visit. The patient was treated with an anticoagulation therapy. Post vaccination COVID-19 test was not done. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, the event deep vein thrombosis was most likely due to the patient&#39;s underlying hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. However a possible contributory role of vaccine BNT162B2 to the event can not be totally excluded. Case will be re-assessed upon the additional information provided. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On the 4th day after the injection I start feeling the extreme weakness and extensive heartbeat which forced me to spend a few days in the bed. Right after that, even if the condition in general got improved, I?m still experiencing extensive heartbeat and occasional pain within the heart area. Also, I got new symptoms for the sciatic nerve related pain.

                                                On 7 April, approx 9AM, pt. experienced a TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack or Mini-stroke).  Siblings became aware by 10:30, and by 11:45 he was at the ER.  His speech was extremely restricted and he was barely able to speak a few words.  Face was partially asymmetric, but gross and fine motor skills basically unaffected.  He could walk and write his name, follow commands to move arm and legs.  Underwent multiple tests including CAT scan, when no sign of bleed stroke confirmed.  At admittance, Stroke Scale score = 4.  By 3PM, speech started to return, and continued to return.  Continued tests with EEG, EKG, and TTE, but no source for TIA could be pinpointed. Unable to perform MRI due to embedded medical device. By next morning speech had almost returned to normal.  No physical restrictions noted on following day.  Discharged 6PM on 8 April.  Doctors unable to explain cause and could not comment on whether related to receiving vaccine a week prior.  Recovery seems to be complete with no negative lasting effects as of 22 April, 2021.

On Sunday, 21Feb2021, he got the second dose of Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine, at night he started experiencing a reaction, he began having sight problems. He thought it would be temporary, so he went to bed (used slang), but on Monday he still had the double vision issue, he had problems in his vision, his eyelid was drooping, so he went to the emergency room at (Name). They determined he has double vision and right now his eyelid is completely drooped. He is very surprised after receiving the vaccine, he has low cholesterol and high blood sugar at 126, his blood pressure was 133-135. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood cholesterol: low on an unspecified date, blood glucose: 126 on an unspecified date, blood pressure measurement: 133-135 on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Two workers (from the mental health day program, he went to before the covid lockdown) both advised him to get the second injection, however, and he complied.  After injection he had episodes of difficulty breathing and vomiting for several nights.  Soon after that, he started having to go to the emergency room for blood sugars over 500 (prior to injection his diabetes had been controllable at care home). When he went to ER (for high blood sugar) March 18th, his heart stopped and could not be re-started.  He died.

His hands, arms, legs, and feet were experiencing pain and burning sensations, they were burning like nerve damage; he also has a little burning sensation in his nose and cheeks. He has never had this before. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. He was also having some weird sensations in his calf muscles, these sensations started within the past week and a half (Apr2021) which prompted physician office visit. The physician placed him on gabapentin 100 mg to start from 12Apr2021, but it was not enough, it was titrated up to 300 mg, three times a day and he is scheduled to see specialist soon. The patient mentioned that this vaccine has ruined his health. He also went to an urgent care center because his leg was bothering him, it was swelling on an unspecified date in 2021; he thought he had a blood clot; they did some kind of test where they looked at the leg and did not find anything. He didn&#39;t have a particular question. He would just like to talk to someone to see if this was going on with anyone else, if it will go away, or if this was permanent problem he will have. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. He received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 13Apr2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                I had the vaccination (my second) and waited the required 15 minutes after the injection.  I felt fine and got on my bike and road home.  I took a longer route (10 miles), and I remember things up to almost the end.  The bike ride ended with a bad fall, I presumably had a syncopal event and crashed my bicycle.  Bad hit on helmet, and I was unconscious for probably five minutes.  I was found and woken up by a passerby (I have no memory of this) and then the EMTs arrived.  Checked into Emergency Room.  They suspected a cardiac event, but I have so far passed all the tests (exercise stress test, echocardiogram, normal QT).  I have *never* had an event like this, the bike ride, while a little long, was quite normal for me.  I also note that I had possibly not had enough to eat or drink that morning.  So, based on the curious timing of this event, I personally believe it&#39;s related to the shot.  I also don&#39;t really believe this is an anxiety related syncopal event (it was more than an hour after the shot), but rather I suspect an immune response, perhaps aggravated by dehydration/lack of enough food.  But who knows?  I was out cold, and don&#39;t remember the minute or so up to the crash.  I did go back to inspect the bikeway that I was on to see if there was anything there that could have caused a crash (tree branches, rough surface) and I found nothing.  It was a pretty flat easy bike path at that point.

Hospital inserted stent. Spoke with all of the Cardiologists about my concerns as Heart problems ?Do not? run in my family. I have always had excellent blood pressure and low cholesterol....my father is 86 and was a smoker, and never been on blood pressure medication, same with my late Grandfather. I?ve ?never? had any type of chest pains in my life. Also, I am retired military and have had numerous vaccines, with no issues. The hospital cardiologists said that I could report this, but they believe the Heart attack is due to the fact that I smoke....I just don?t believe that....the Heart Attack occurred 36 hours after my second vaccine!!!

Symptoms worsened about a week ago with persistent fevers, increasing cough and shortness of breath.  Patient went to see his rheumatologist and diagnosed with interstitial lung disease this week and referred to see pulmonology.  He was monitoring his oxygen saturations at home which have been dropping down to 88-89% on room air that made him come to the ER.  Patient tested positive for COVID-19 in the emergency room.  CT angiogram of the chest showed no evidence of any pulmonary emboli but evidence of interstitial lung disease bilaterally.  He is currently being admitted for hypoxia secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.  Patient denies any chest pain   Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted.  Kept on steroids and oxygen.  Seen by Infectious Disease.  Got a dose of convalescent plasma   This morning he is on room air.  Past the walk study.  Feeling lot better.

Found to be pancytopenic with bone marrow biopsy consistent with MDS.  He was started on chemo but stay was complicated by neutropenic fevers, epistaxis, retinal hemorrhage, AKI, fluid overload, hypoxic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and shock.  He ultimately had a heart attack while admitted and was transitioned to comfort care after medical interventions could not stabilize hemodynamics.

                                                Starting on the day of the vaccine (2nd dose)- I felt &#34;a warm, chemical and electrical sensation&#34; in my chest a few hours after the vaccine. The next morning, I was unable to have a bowel movement, when usually I am very regular.  I was not able to have a bowel movement for a couple of days.  I felt very constipated and would try to force myself to have a bowel movement.  I ate more fiber and fiber pills and drink more water, which was uneffective.  I  was finally able to have a bowel movement but it took a lot of force and would push the point of exhaustion and almost passing out. On 2/19/2021, I decided to seek medical care for my constipation, stomach cramps, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and shortness of breath. The doctor diagnosed me with Covid long hauler (I had a previous covid infection in 11/2020).  I was prescribe probotics (for constipation) and  rest for 2 months.  I am still feeling fatigue and having heart palpitations. They order ECG(normal) and blood work (normal).

                                                blood pressure was elevated; a migraine like headache; persistent severe headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 58-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Apr2021 (Lot number and Expiry date was not reported) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing body mass index increased. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received first dose of vaccine on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. History included he does not really take anything.  He has had some injuries lately but that is not a medical condition. On 20Apr2021 the patient experienced a migraine like headache, on an unspecified date the patient experienced blood pressure was elevated. He has had a persistent severe headache which sometimes feels like a migraine since receiving the vaccine. She was concerned because his MD has never heard of a headache lasting this long (approximately 3 weeks) after the vaccine. She wants to know if this has been reported before. The migraine like headache from what caller&#39;s husband said was it started in the evening. He had the vaccine in the morning, but caller was a little fuzzy on that because they did not go together. By evening, he had a dull headache that got worse. He has headache ever since. He went to the doctors a week ago and they checked his blood pressure and did all kinds of things. They did say they thought there was a chance it was the vaccine even thought they had not heard of it lasting that long. This week, yesterday, they took him to the ER to get an evaluation and it just will not stop. The family doctor did full blood workup and everything was in normal ranges. They took his sugar and protein that tells you hydration. His blood pressure was elevated. When he went to the ER, caller things they repeated the screenings. They did carbon monoxide testing, CAT Scan, and Chest x-ray. Everything came out good or, well, it was negative. They want him to see a neurologist. They hooked him up to an IV and they tried to relieve the pain with a headache cocktail and it did not take the edge off of it. So, they are a little baffled by that. Caller does not know specific dates, times, or results. Caller states she does not know what the medications were, maybe it was Toradol was one thing she heard, and they also gave him Benadryl with it. They said it was something they give to people with migraines and it takes it out and helps them sleep. He usually does not take anything but she got him to try allergy medicine, a couple days of Excedrin, and a couple of days of other things. None of them seem to work. He told the ER and they said if it does not work, do not take it. Also, he took Aleve a couple of days. Caller does not have any of this information as she is at work, and she states she did buy all of them. He tried name brand Aleve, Allegra for about 3 days, generic Excedrin which she thinks was Ibuprofen, and Tylenol. Caller confirms her husband was not admitted to the hospital, they sent him home with a referral to follow up with neuro and not the family doctor, and to come back if it gets worse. Today he was supposed to call them. Caller&#39;s husband was at the ER yesterday, 09May2021. A CAT Scan showed no mass or anything. They gave him several different things to relieve the headache and nothing worked. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.
