A 40-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Batch/lot number: EK5730, via an unspecified route of administration on 26Dec2020 as a single dose (age at vaccination: 40 years old), right arm for COVID -19 immunization. Medical history included chronic back pain.  Concomitant medication included amitriptyline (AMITRIPTYLINE), cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL) for chronic back pain, and hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (NORCO) for chronic back pain. On 26Dec2020, the patient had a &#34;near sick able episode&#34; and a rapid heart rate.  The initial side effect was about 7 minutes after the patient had the vaccine, came on just very quickly. The place where they had the patient discharged him, allowed him to go home, but the rapid heart rate stayed with the patient for next 24 hours and he went to an urgent care and they sent him to emergency room. The patient went to the emergency room (27Dec2020) and they ran an EKG, X-ray, and did a COVID swab; everything came back negative. Lab work, X-ray everything came back fine, the only thing they found was hypoglycemia, heart palpitations, and abnormal EKG, which was described by the reporter as &#34;normal sinus rhythm left axis deviation pulmonary disease pattern&#34; and then at the bottom it said &#34;abnormal EKG.&#34; Heart rate was 136/88 (as reported) so it was definitely improving, the highest it was at 189/110 (as reported). No treatment was received for the events. The clinical outcome of the events &#34;near sick able episode,&#34; rapid heart rate, and palpitations was recovering, while the clinical outcome of hypoglycemia and abnormal ECG was unknown.

A 40-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine and also reported as Covid Vaccine; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration left deltoid (reported as once by injection on the left deltoid) on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 vaccination. The patient has no medical history and concomitant medications.  The physician reported that he got the COVID Vaccine on 18Dec2020 and he got Lymphadenopathy as a possible side effect of the vaccine. It was recently (03Jan2021), he noticed an enlarged lymph node (Lymph node is on left supraclavicular, so above the clavicle on the left side). It could be unrelated, but he was told to call and report it. He would like to know were there patients in the clinical trial who got lymphadenopathy (which part of the body). He did not received treatment. He knows that lymphadenopathy was reported in the study. The reported considered the event as non-serious. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Later that night, about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, I experienced mild wheezing for less than 5 minutes, but believe this was likely due to allergies and associated postnasal drip rather than the vaccine.  The following day I had mild muscle soreness and injection site pain without swelling or redness.

The first couple days I had a really sore left arm, but didn?t feel any ?side effects? until about Wednesday, 1/6 (about a week later). I remember waking up to a sore left side of my upper body. The left side of my neck, chest, arm, and lymph node (under my left arm) felt weird. It was until about Saturday night, 1/9, that I felt my left under arm lymph node noticeably swollen. I had a bad headache and loss of energy, and overall feeling unwell. No fever or night sweats to report. I was absent from work on 1/11 and 1/12, as a result.  1/13 was my first day back and feel better. The swollen left lymph node is no longer present, but still slightly tired. I did not seek Medical Care for my symptoms.

COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his &#34;deconditioning&#34; in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.

I couldn&#39;t get warm and had to put on extra clothing during the day and extra blankets when I went to sleep. I think this is considered to be chills. On both Tuesday and Wednesday, I ran out of energy by the afternoon. On both Tuesday and Wednesday, my head felt heavy.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

The medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine on 2020 for immunization 2-3 months before this BNT162B2 vaccine, previously took flu shot in the past for immunization and got sick from it. That was about 3 years ago (2018). The patient went and got the Pfizer BioNTech about 2 weeks ago. Wants to know if side effects can start then after the vaccine. He has had chills, muscle pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Got this at hospital and has not been able to go to work on Jan2021 that last 3-4 days due to feeling weak. Received the vaccine on 30Dec2020 and the dizziness and shortness of breath kind of started days after that on Dec2020. The chills started a couple of days ago, about 3 days ago (Jan2021) and has been off and on. The muscle pains started today (13Jan2021).

                                                The patient is a 41 yo male with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis who experienced DVT and PE temporally related to Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine dose #2 receipt.  He is a Service Member and reported  high levels of baseline activity, including running 10 miles each Saturday. He received vaccine #1 25 JAN 21 (EN5318) without AE. He received dose #2 on 16 FEB 21, (EN6200). He experienced no immediate symptoms suggestive of IgE event. On day 1 he reports feeling cold, mild fatigue but no other symptoms. On day 2 he was baseline. On day 3 he noted numbness, tightness  and discomfort to his right  calf. On day 4 (Saturday), his usual long run day, he experienced dyspnea and lightheadedness after running 20-30 feet. He states he noted tightness in his calf and instead walked the track while his wife completed her run. He rested day 5.  Day 6 he noted significant edema to his calf, which he describes as double normal in size, and iced it. Day 7, he tried to schedule with PCP and based on triage was sent to ER. ER diagnosed R DVT and bilateral PE&#39;s. He was admitted overnight, started anticoagulation therapy. He saw hematology, and the workup was negative for other causes.

Denies any fevers recorded at home. He feels like he has extra beats intermittently. Also reports some nausea, but denies vomiting or diarrhea. He has maintained good PO intake since symptoms started, but is worried he may be a bit dehydrated because he had a small AKI when he had covid back in March?.  Etiology of chest pains unclear, but given all of the above workup, unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac or pulmonary etiology.&#34;  He continued to have palpitations for the next week and had further EKG&#39;s don thru urgent care.

I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

They stated to take it as not enough data was present to prevent me to take.  On 02/11, I spoke with doctors onsite and discussed my medical history.  They advised to take the shot as not enough data was present to prevent me to take.  On 02/14, I noticed bleeding in gums and petechiae at the injection site.  I went to hematologist on 02/15, and platelets were at 2,000.  I started 60 mg of prednisone immediately on 02/15.  By 02/19, took blood sample and eceived one 70g dose of IVIG.  Blood results came back on 02/20, and platelets were at 22,000 but did not cover results from after IVIG treatment.  Hematologist decided to stop follow up IVIG treatment and stick to 60mg of prednisone daily as in the past my body has reacted well to it.  On 02/24, platelet count went to 300,000.  I&#39;ve started to taper prednisone to 50mg and will continue with weekly blood tests to verify that platelets remain strong.  Hemoglobin and all over blood levels in the CBC remained normal during this time.  Hematologist has advised not to take second Pfizer COVID-19 shot due to risk.

Body was shaking and didn?t have a fever. Skin felt like it was burning whole body felt swollen. Started around 2:30am with the cramping. It woke me up. Once I got up everything came so fast. Was rushed to hospital where I was admitted very quickly. I was blacking out on the drive there and blacked out while in their care. This was from one dose of Pfizer vaccine for Covid. I was put on a GI, Allergy, and steroid medications. I was hooked up to an IV and 3 drugs were injected. I passed out numerous times but was discharged at 5am.

                                                10 min after injection, my mouth started getting hot, then it moved down my throat and it was difficult and painful to swallow. I got quite dizzy. They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

Lymph nodes on right side do not seem to be affected.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 44-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EH9899) 1st dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 in the evening time (around 6-7 or maybe a little later) at single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was none.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the COVID Vaccine that same day, his heart rate went up and then it came down and he was fine. Later that night while sleeping he got up again because he could feel his heart rate going up. It was not way up, but he could tell it was up. He was trying to catch an actual reading on the monitor of his heart rate, but he was not able to before it came back down. He was calling because he is wondering if this was considered a severe allergic reaction. He got the vaccine and was able to walk to his car. His mouth got dry right after the vaccine within a minute or two and noticed his heart rate went up. Treatment: He took some deep breaths and drunk water and it got better. He drove home, but that at nighttime while sleeping he noticed his heart rate went up a couple of times, but then it came back down. He could not get a reading of heart rate right away. The highest he saw on the monitor that he was able to capture was 101 and then it came back down. He was not sure if this was because he was nervous. He just had a couple of episodes that night and then nothing again. He also experienced his arm being sore from the vaccination. However, he stated that is to be expected. He stated the arm sore started a few days after getting the COVID Vaccine and then it was gone. Stated he was calling because he was concerned because Pfizer said to report any issues. He started to feel better and added this may not even be an issue. He just got concerned. Mentioned he was not sure if real side effects or if he was over thinking things. Outcome of the events was resolved.

                                                As soon as I received the shot and went into the waiting area, I experienced a tingling sensation down my right arm where the injection was administered. Throughout the 15 minutes the sensation began to radiate throughout my body and extremities. I waited about 20 minutes before deciding to leave the facility and proceed with my afternoon.  Once I got home, I experienced chills, which I read on the pamphlet was an expected side effect. Both hands and feet were cold and I put on additional layers and lied on the couch and rested. During that time I began to notice the tingling sensation/paresthesia predominantly in the injected (right) arm, but also sporadically in other parts of my body including thigh (front/back), left arm, elbow, back, torso, neck, head, wrists, buttocks, etc. This sensation continued as I prepared for bed and continues as of this writing.  It&#39;s difficult to say whether the sensation is getting better or worse, but it is consistent best described as someone pricking you every so often.

                                                Fever/a temp of 101; feels something is different; intermittent minimal pain especially when he wakes up; Tachycardia; His CRP was up a little at 1.1; Nausea; Shortness of breath; Fatigue; Pain at injection site left shoulder; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician reporting for himself. A 44-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at a single dose on the left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 28Dec2020. Since receiving the vaccine, he has experienced multiple side effects at varying time points: pain at injection site left shoulder (experienced pain first day of receiving vaccine on 28Dec2020 and couple of days after fever (unspecified date) resolved (on an unspecified date); he was currently experiencing intermittent minimal pain especially when he wakes up; feels something is different; fever (experienced 08Jan2021); fatigue (developed 07Jan2021). He went to the ER on 08Jan2021 when he developed fever, nausea and shortness of breath which also resolved that day. When he went to ER, his CRP was up a little at 1.1. His PCR and antigen test was negative at that time (08Jan2021); a retest of PCR done 5 days after sxs started (unclear of time window) was negative. He was concerned that he had the fever many days after the vaccine. HCP was asking if any cases of fever and fatigue reported after 7 days (around the 10 day mark) of receiving the first dose. He stated that he is planning on taking the second dose. The patient is a physician calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine. He received his first dose on 28Dec2020. He had a little bit of pain in his left arm on same day, but it went away. About 10 days later, 07Jan2021, he had fever and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, he went to the ER with a temp of 101. He had tachycardia, nausea and shortness of breath. He was not admitted, stated his fever was controlled and his breathing was better. His oxygen was 100% and everything was ok and he was sent home. In the ER he had xrays and labs and everything was ok, except his CRP was a bit up. In the ER he had an antigen and pcr covid test (08Jan2021) and they both came back negative. About 4 or 5 days after the symptoms started, he had an outpatient repeat pcr test and nucleic acid rapid test (unspecified dates) and they both came back negative. He is on his way to get his second dose and he is asking if the symptoms could be side effects from the vaccine. Outcome the event fever was recovered on an unspecified date. Outcome of nausea and shortness of breath was recovered on 08Jan2021, while outcome of pain at injection site left shoulder was recovered on 28Dec2020. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

A 44-years-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Feb2021 17:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at hospital. Medical history included coronary artery disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unknown date for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not have covid before vaccination. The patient experienced small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. These events were serious as life threatening, disability and requiring hospitalization from 21Feb2021 till 23Feb2021 at 14:00. On 20Feb2021 07:00 the patient experienced headache, chill, running nose, shortness of breath with outcome of recovering. The patient experienced also pains in chest on 21Feb2021 11:00 with outcome of recovering and injection location had redness, hardness on an unspecified date with outcome of recovering. Clinical course was as follows. 19Feb2021-5:45pm the patient went to receive vaccine shot. 20Feb2021 the patient had headache, chill, runny nose, and shortness of breath. 21Feb2021 11am still had shortness of breath and pains in chest. Went to clinic had a rapid Covid test come back negative, pain increased and he went to emergency room. The patient was admitted to the hospital with small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues. Inflammatory response seems to possibly triggered possible underlying issue of minor heart disease. Then induced heart attack and myocardial issue. The patient would gladly be admitted to a clinic for observation and testing to assist Pfizer in understanding this unfortunate situation. The injection location had redness, hardness. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment due to the event which included multiple lab tests, Angiogram, CR scan and pain medicine.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

But the second dose of this vaccine (on 2/7/2021) was different. In addition to the severe pain on my left arm, I had (and still) a severe headache, pains all over my body and bones, high fever (102), dizziness, shaking, fatigue, cold at all times, and a little bit taste loss (as of right now, 24 hours after the vaccine). It looks like a hard flu symptoms exactly.

On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

Narrative:  12/21 employee received vaccine at 0930 - later in the afternoon he noted tachycardia to about 100. He was watching the rate on his Apple watch. The highest rate was 130. His only other symptom was fatigue which was bad enough on 12/22 that he had to go home. He saw his PCP on 12/22 for the tachycardia who ordered labs which were all normal. He is a resident so he asked anesthesia to do an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia. On 12/23 his heart rate average went down to 100. Today (12-28) his resting heart rate is 70-80 which is his baseline. He has not had recurrence of the tachycardia since 12/23. He also reports he had soreness at the injection site and myalgias both of which have since resolved.

                                                Approximately 13 hours after receiving the vaccine I became overwhelmingly tired. Went to get ready for bed by first going into the bathroom. While getting ready I passed out (micturation syncope). Hit my head on the floor and sustained a concussion. I am still experiencing post concussive symptoms but this is to be expected as it has been less than a week.

Pulse-oximetry applied revealed normal spO2, but tachycardia to 140bpm (this patient&#39;s resting HR is approximately 55-65).  Apple Watch data confirmed rapid increase in HR at that moment.  BP increased from normal baseline to about 150-160 SBP.  No chest pain reported.  No signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis (rash, wheezing, etc.).  HR gradually recovered to normal levels within 30 minutes and patient was released after 60 min observation.  Patient reported generalized fatigue in weeks following injection.   Nineteen (19) days after injection, patient developed unprovoked resting tachycardia to approximately 180bpm (following some moderate weigh-lifting exercise).  Symptoms did no resolve sufficiently and patient was transported by EMS to ER for evaluation

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

This 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; borderline diabetes. Concomitant medications included losartan; alirocumab (PRALUENT, injection) on 20Jan2021. Since 23Jan2021, patient was dizzy all along and almost fainted and was still having symptoms of mild migraine and he don&#39;t know like some light sensitivity. Doctor believed it was from vaccine. Patient was wondering how long was this going to be last as he had second shot coming out. He didn&#39;t think it was an adverse reaction and he thought he should get the second shot. But this was continuing to me and it had already been two weeks and patient still having symptoms of mild migraine. Patient was worried about taking the second shot as a result. He had never had a migraine before and was told it was probably from the vaccine and that was not something he wanted to hear. Patient wanted to know if this was normal to still be having this side effect for this long. Patient was taking acetaminophen (for migraine), it was not a TYLENOL, it was from a different brand. Patient did liver and cholesterol test and blood test in Jan2021 at Cardiologist and they came back fine, nothing was found there. The outcome of event migraine was not resolved. The outcome of rest events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Background, I had Covid back at the end of May/beginning of June with 1 week of constant fevers (with 500mg tylenol q6), shortness of breath, fatigue, but no real cough. O2 sats somtimes in low 90&#39;s . I am one of the radiology faculty at the hospital I work at. Received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday Dec 18 at about 21:30. After the injection, I had moderate pain at the site of injection about 6 hours later, not unexpected. However, the next evening, I was feeling fatigued and went to bed at about 7 p.m. For the next three hours, I felt chills and finally at about 10 p.m. I took my temp after I felt that my fever had &#34;broke&#34; and temp was 101.9. Used a finger pulse ox just to make sure sats were ok, they were at 97%, but unexpectedly, resting heart rate was 130 bpm. I took some tylenol and called the ER, and they suggested calling the covid hotline pager and coming in if I did not improve. I called the hotline pager, and we discussed things and eventually decided that I should go to the ER as temp remained at 101.6. By the time I reached the ER, my temp was down to 100.8, but pulse still 122 (EKG with no other abnormalities) and BP was 165/100. I had no other symptoms to account another infection. Over the next two hours, vitals became more normal with HR down to 95 to 100, and BP down to 145/85 or so without any other intervention.  Sunday, still with some mild low grade temps of 99.8, but heart rate at 85 to 90 (I&#39;m usually at about 80).   In the ER, we came to the conclusion that my body mounted a significant immune response to the production of antigens after processing the mRNA given the lack of alternative diagnosis and the improvement of sx without any other intervention besides the 500 mg of tylenol I took before coming in.

She did not have any symptoms until 5:00 p.m. the following afternoon when she woke up. She developed itching of her back and a mild erythematous rash across her chest.  That evening around 7:00 p.m. she noticed a rash on her arms that was itching.  At 7:30 p.m. she had tightness in her chest and a nonproductive cough.  She attributed the symptoms to her asthma. Her symptoms improved throughout the night. She went home on Christmas morning and went to bed.  She woke up at around 5:00 p.m. She had swelling of her eyelids and an urticarial rash across her face and chest. She did have some mild throat itching. She reported to work at 7:00 p.m. but continued to have symptoms with increasing shortness of breath. She reported to the emergency department and was evaluated. She was given famotidine, Methylprednisolone, and hydroxyzine.  She was also given ipratropium/albuterol nebulized.  Her respiratory symptoms did improve, and she was discharged around midnight. She continued to have a slight erythematous rash that was present until she went to bed the following morning. When she woke up it had resolved.

Denies any allergies but did states she has history of low potassium and has had issues with medications nad vaccines in the past.  However no sx like this but does get &#34;a little loopy&#34; even when taking motrin. Instructed her to notify any provider prior to any vaccinations of the above sx.

Palpitations became so frequent that I went to my PCP&#39;s office, where I was found to have an abnormal rhythm on my EKG (non-sustained V-tach, runs of 4-5 beats at a time).  I then went to hospital where I was admitted to observation in the ED for monitoring.

A 50-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at site of left arm at 09:00 on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included colitis (in remission right now). There were no concomitant medications. The patient received shot and felt soreness on 29Dec2020, had sharp pains on left side of chest on 30Dec2020, and when taking a deep breath there is a little soreness right below the ribcage. Clinical course: patient got the vaccine on 29Dec2020 and felt soreness, like with a tetanus shot. On the 30th2020 he was kind of sore and then by midday all of a sudden felt the sharp pain in his chest, and once in a while when taking a deep breath there is a little soreness right below the ribcage. He went to the emergency room on 01Jan2021 and they first did the EKG, then the X-ray and they both were normal. To rule out pulmonary embolism they did CT scan and that was all fine. He also just wanted to rule out heart or lung problems since he is pretty healthy. He did not receive any other vaccines the same day and none 4 weeks prior. Vaccination facility type in hospital. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                On 1/27/2021, after having received Dose #2 of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 01/07/21, I experienced severe calf pain while playing soccer. Over the next 2 weeks I experienced vascular claudication in that leg and was eventually diagnosed with arterial thrombus in Left tibioperoneal, anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial  arteries. I do not have any known predisposing conditions for arterial thrombus and no history of thromboembolic disease.

A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 (at the age of 54-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included metformin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, glimepiride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, lisinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient experienced not feeling well, ate a bit but not much, kind of pale, vomiting, trouble in breathing, and agitated on 04Jan2021; body was hyper dried and restless on 05Jan2021; mind just seemed like it was racing on 06Jan2021; and not responsive and he passed away on 06Jan2021 at 10:15 (reported as: around 10:15 AM). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the vaccine on 04Jan2021, after which he started not feeling well. He went right home and went to bed. He woke up and ate a bit but not much and then was kind of pale. The patient then started to vomit, which continued throughout the night. He was having trouble in breathing. Emergency services were called, and they took his vitals and said that everything was okay, but he was very agitated; reported as not like this prior to the vaccine. The patient was taken to urgent care where they gave him an unspecified steroid shot and unspecified medication for vomiting. The patient was told he was probably having a reaction to the vaccine, but he was just dried up. The patient continued to vomit throughout the day and then he was very agitated again and would fall asleep for may be 15-20 minutes. When the patient woke up, he was very restless (reported as: his body was just amped up and could not calm down). The patient calmed down just a little bit in the evening.

                                                Patient is noticed to have generalized weakness, holding his head towards right side, mild right facial puffiness with mild left facial droop, and sent to ER, on 1/22/21. Patient also had mild fever for the last two days and was on Tylenol, blood pressure also remained elevated moderately than the usual readings. Patient was admitted through ER for 2 days and was discharged on 1/24/21, with a diagnosis of possible TIA, Todd&#39;s paresis post seizure. Patient&#39;s CT head and MRI of brain was negative for acute stroke. Patient&#39;s left facial droop and right side facial puffiness resolved over a week but noticed to have right sided pronounced weakness with moderate swelling on right arm. Patient used to eat by himself,but now not able to do so and not able to hold cup in the right hand. Patient was again sent to ER for repeat CAT scan of head, further evaluation and management. Not sure if patient had an adverse reaction to Covid-19 vaccination, but definitely these symptoms were developed after 2 weeks of receiving Pfizer vaccination, which may be coincidental. Patient was followed up by the neurologist a week after the discharge from hospital who couldn&#39;t rule out adverse reaction of vaccination. Patient is awaiting for an EEG, carotid ultrasound and Echo as an out patient.

No excessive cough or fever, did have dyspnea with any exertion and this continues but seems to be lessening. Was not able to work due to fatigue. Yesterday remained tired but felt noticeably different-felt lighter-and today seems promising.

I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

                                                had a feeling of impending death and thought he was gonna die.; Syncopal episode; My platelets counts drop; metallic taste; Potassium level went down; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 55-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248) first dose on 12Feb2021 on Deltoid Left at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Covid-19 and High cholesterol. Concomitant medications were not reported. He said that he was 60 days post COVID and his doctor advised him to get vaccinated. He was feeling fine, but after 10 minutes into the shot, he had a metallic taste in the mouth. After 12-13 minutes, he had a feeling of impending death and thought he was gonna die. It freaked him out. He was rushed to the ER and had a complete blood count (CBC) and Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) test run on him. It was that his Potassium level went down to 3.3 and his platelets dropped to 141. He had tests on 28Jan2021 and mentioned that his Potassium levels were normal and had a platelet count of 181. He mentioned that there was no other way but the vaccine that could have caused this. He is if he would already have passed away from the shot from his opinion. Patient had a Syncopal episode of some type. He had an intended feeling like he was going to die after the shot, he was 60 days post Covid when he get that shot, he was getting over Covid and he was 60 days and he didn&#39;t wait the 90 days his primary doctor care told me that he can get it too because he was feeling better which he was feeling better but since then he have gotten that shot, he went to the doctor on the 28Jan2021 and he had CBC drawn on him and he went for his regular physical and Covid follow-up at his doctor, his platelets counts drop since he have had shot struck at 40 points, feels concerning. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported &#34;feeling of impending death and Syncopal episode &#34; and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EH9899), via intramuscular route on 17Dec2020 at single dose (dose 1, left deltoid) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included non-smoker. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient was scheduled to take the second dose on 05Jan2021, also reported as 08Jan2021. The patient experienced sore arm for 24 hours afterwards on Dec2020. Patient experienced mild COVID symptoms such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, and tiny bit of shortness of breath on 24Dec2020, but stated he was better now. The patient was positive in the COVID test on 28Dec2020. He wanted to know if it was normal to get COVID after getting the vaccine and if he should get the booster shot if he gets better.  He commented that testing positive for COVID was medically concerning. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow ECMO) or receive a mechanical ventilation. Treatment included over the counter medication. No additional testing was done. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the event sore arm was unknown; cough was not recovered; fever, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, tiny bit of shortness of breath was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number was already obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 virus test positive cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A 56-year-old male patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, lot number: EL0140, exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (vaccine location: right arm) on 05Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: Hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no Covid prior to vaccination. On 05Jan2021, 30 min after injection, felt a mild palpitation-stronger than any previous mild ones but not as strong as the strong one he experienced after the first injection, and he had to close his eyes due to the faint feeling. This was followed by a mild one 3 min later. In the next few days, he had several additional mild to weak palpitations. The strong one that he experienced was 12-14 hours after receiving the first dose, did not show. The patient also experienced arm soreness after the first dose (Jan2021). The patient was not Covid tested post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

                                                I started having exertional chest pain and dyspnea on 2/11/2021.  I had a negative stress ECHO on 2/16/2021.  Symptoms persisted and suddenly worsened on 3/9/2021 requiring an emergency cardiac cath and cardiac stents in my circumflex and LAD arteries.  The cardiologist described their appearance as soft and more like clot/thrombosis than atherosclerotic plaque.  There was an existing atherosclerotic plaque in my LAD that was unchanged from prior imaging studies going back to 2012.  Therefore, this event did not look like progressive atherosclerosis; but instead appeared to be the sudden formation of clot/thrombosis in 2 of my coronary arteries shortly after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine.

I exp fatigue and couldn&#39;t sleep  I went to ER HR 180/10, elevated HR/BP, muscle joint pain and tremendous back pain. After I followed up with my PCP still elevated BP 140/70  as a result I&#39;m on blood pressure medication. I was advised to stay on this new medicine until I receive the second dose of the vaccine. Also was told to take Benadryl and Tylenol before taking 2nd Covid vaccine.

                                                On  January 8,  I started having a cramping feeling in my right calf. It went on throughout the day without a event.   I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

I was already not feeling my best that morning symptoms of warmness at home no fever , I checked. No issues with vaccine given approximately 0715, until 1005 am after a very busy morning with nothing but coffee to drink. As I sat down to assist in order entry in our chemo clinic I suddenly became aware of a very rapid heart rate. I realized that I was having a vaso-vagal response and started perspiring lightly and realizing I was having drop in blood pressure. I composed myself removed my mask and breathed slowly and drank cold water while sitting. After a few minutes I was able to slow my heart rate and felt secure enough to leave the pharmacy. I slowly walked and controlled my breathing and continued to drink water. I was able to return to work and continued until the end of the day. I felt somewhat fatigued until bedtime that evening. Slept reasonably well that night and had no other symptoms to my memory the following day.

                                                Heart rate increased; Swelling arm; Arm soreness; soreness at the vaccine injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 13:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) at an unspecified dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was reported as &#34;no pre-existing conditions.&#34; He mentioned that he reviewed his allergies with a pharmacist prior to vaccination but did not specify what his allergies were. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was a tobacco user from an unknown date. The patient also reported a history of pneumonia which was reported to have occurred on seven different occasions following each of seven different vaccinations with the flu vaccine (manufacturers unknown) prior to 2013. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. He stated that after receiving the COVID 19 Vaccine he had side effects. He said the side effects went away at twenty four hours later, but he is still having one side effect, and has a concern. He clarified that he has an elevated heart rate since getting the COVID 19 Vaccine. He said he has never had an elevated heart rate before getting the COVID 19 Vaccine. He reported his heart rate is normally low, between 62-65. He said when he was at work on 28Dec2020 his heart rate was OK, but prior to going to bed that night his heart rate was 93 - 95. He said he thought at first he was just stressed. He also reported the COVID 19 Vaccine is the only thing he has taken. He mentioned that his heart rate has been down to 93, but then up to 105, and higher. He specified that he first presented with an elevated heart rate between 4:00 5:00PM on Tuesday, 29Dec2020. He said the elevated heart rate subsided enough for him to sleep later that day. He said he then started work around 10:00AM today, 30Dec2020, and felt the elevated heart rate in himself, and didn&#39;t say anything to anyone at work. He said when his heart rate got bad, it was about 12:30PM today and that today (30Dec2020) at work he didn&#39;t feel right at lunch, so he took his oxygen level and heart rate. He said his heart rate was 141. He said he called his primary care doctor, but didn&#39;t go to the emergency room. He said he doesn&#39;t have chest pain. He said he said something about his heart rate to a staff member at work, and the staff member tested his heart rate, and told him it was 141. He said he spoke to the nurse at his doctor&#39;s office, and the nurse said the doctor couldn&#39;t do much, and that he could go to emergency room or their practice&#39;s urgent care that is open until 7:00PM.  He said he tried to go to the hospital emergency room, but ended up driving by because the hospital was so busy they were triaging patient&#39;s in the parking lot. The patient also experienced arm swelling and arm soreness following the vaccination on 28Dec2020. He said he could feel the soreness at the vaccine injection site when he moved his left arm. He stated that the swelling was down to his biceps and it resolved within 12- to 14 hours after the vaccination. As treatment, the patient took a generic 81 mg Baby Aspirin (UPC Number: 050428323922, Lot Number: P110657 Expiration Date: May2020) on 30Dec2020 between 3:00 and 3:30. The patient stated that the generic 81mg baby aspirin was an expired product. The clinical outcome of heart rate increased was not recovered and the clinical outcome of arm swelling, arm soreness and vaccination site soreness was recovered on 28Dec2020.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.

On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January.

I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician&#39;s Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.  Note however I move around very often during a work day and operate a farm tractor and have an active life style.  I have not recently had any extended trips more than 2 hours nor have I flown within the past year or so.
