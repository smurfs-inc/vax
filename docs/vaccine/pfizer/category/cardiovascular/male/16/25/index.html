His mother gently lowered him to the ground (@ 1804). Patient&#39;s mother stated he just passed out and that this was his first injection ever in his life. Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient&#39;s legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling &#34;a star&#34; on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%. Immediately after the patient passed out the second time, his pulse was measured at 38 bpm and his lips displayed slight cyanosis. His pulse quickly rose to 52 bpm, within less than 10 seconds. One minute later his pulse was up to 68 bpm.

                                                High blood sugars for a week now.  My son is 16 year&#39;s old and was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in November.  He is thin and active, and an otherwise healthy teen and runner.  He is in his &#34;honeymoon phase&#34; of diabetes and I think the vaccine may be killing off beta cells.  He went from having blood sugar levels in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s at 12 units of Lantus to now 120&#39;s to 130&#39;s and up to 160&#39;s immediately after the shot.  His mealtime insulin is also not working at the same number of units and he&#39;s going in the 200&#39;s when he was around 160&#39;s before the shot. It has lasted now for a week instead of the 48 hours I was told about and read about.   As soon as we were leaving from getting his vaccine, he started experiencing extreme fatigue.  That night and for 2 days he had a headache.  He is still more tired than usual and having to take naps.

                                                vasovagal syncopal episode after receiving his first COVID vaccine.  Patient became nauseous and began to perspire.  He was able to respond to verbal commands, and never had complete LOC.  We were able to provide oral hydration and cold compresses.  After 15 mins I was able to have him sit in a chair, where he stated he was feeling much better.  After a total of 45 mins, he was able to walk out of clinic independently

                                                Patient was nervous upon receipt of vaccine.  It was an unscheduled (expiring) dose.  Per parent, he had fallen asleep outside vaccine room and they had to wake him up to get vaccine.   I gave immunization and asked him to stay for 15 minutes afterwards.  His Mom ran to consult window to notify staff patient was passing out.  I was sanitizing vaccine room so I immediately ran to him and his Dad and I caught him as he was slumping over.  He was shaking really hard, weak, and clammy.  He was coherent b/c I asked him his name but did not have clear recollection of timing of vaccine.  He was very pale in color.  His Mom grabbed him a Gatorade and he seemed very thirsty as he was drinking.  He mentioned he felt dizzy and that both arms were hurting and the arm I gave vaccine in felt like he had sweat dripping off it.  (I felt his arm and it did not).  I grabbed an instant cold pack and placed on his neck to help cool him off.  His color returned over the 30 minutes.  I asked parents if they wanted me to call ambulance but they wanted to wait and see how he responded.  He looked at his iPhone data and his heart rate had spiked.  Unclear if right before vaccine or right after but I believe he mentioned it went up to 120 when Mom said his normal resting heart rate was 60.  He ate some gold fish and seemed to perk up and have a few funny conversations showing his personality.  I explained to him very important to let parents know if he experienced any other side effects after leaving.  He was able to stand up and walk out of RX with parents.

After mom was vaccinated I had my bad to the patient and his mom throwing away supplies, Pt passed out and was not responsive to mom or to myself the pharmacist. I thought the patient needed an EpiPen and went to get the EpiPen out of the pharmacy and while my back was turned mom stated that the patient convulsed a few times. By the time I returned with the EpiPen pt was not convulsing and had passed out and started to recover and become responsive. Pt was pale but was aware of his name, birthday, date, and current president. A tech called EMS. Pt was talking when EMS arrived and color had started to return to normal. pt was able to walk out to the ambalance to be checked out. Mom stated she wanted to take pt to ER for more evaluation.

                                                Patient started to feel dizzy for about one minute. His father states that patient was sitting up on a chair and he started to fall backward, so his father caught him and lowered him to the ground. He did not hit his head. He was not responsive for approximately 10 seconds, per the father. Clinical monitors arrived and patient was alert and oriented to name, place, date/time. He was slightly pale and clammy but he denied any dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, headache, changes in his vision/hearing, or nausea.  He was laying on his back on the ground with his legs elevated on a chair and he started to feel better, and his blood pressure and oxygen saturation were stable with mild bradycardia per the vital signs obtained by one RN. He said he was feeling better and he was smiling and joking with staff. He slowly started to sit up and sipped bottled water. Stated that he had not eaten since 11am, and he agreed to a snack.  I left to get him a snack, and RN said that he started to &#34;zone out&#34; and he lost consciousness again for approximately 20 seconds. When I came back, he was sitting up, conscious, and had spit up saliva and water onto his shirt. His breathing was steady.   He again stated that he was feeling better very quickly, again in good spirits, but his father and I agreed that it would be best to call 911 to transport him to the ER just to be safe. He did not hit his head. He denied dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, changes in vision,  and headache. He was alert and oriented to name, place, and time. EMS was requested and they arrived, took his vitals, and he was transported to the Emergency Dept for futher care.   He and his father were confident that he would recover quickly as he had a history of syncopal episodes related to vaccines in the past.

                                                Pt was seated in the waiting area after receiving his first dose of covid 19. His parents who also received the vaccine were waiting with him. I was preparing another dose for patients waiting for their covid vaccination. I heard pounding on the clinic room and ran to check. The mom had knocked on the door because her son had fallen out of his chair.. when I arrived he was on the floor and his parents said he was regaining consciousness and moved him in to a seated position. At this point another customer was calling 911. I had my technician call management.  I observed the patient and asked if he was doing ok. His parents asked him if he was hurt and he responded in the negative. The patient was feeling cold and his hands were &#34;cold and clamy&#34; according to his mom so I held off on the cold compress. He wanted water but was also nauseous so I told the parents that I do not want to risk aspiration. We gave him a bag to throw up. I recommended that they take him to get seen when the paramedics arrived as I was concerned about him shaking before fainting. At this point the paramedics arrived and he was taken to the hospital as he was not feeling well. I followed up with the patient&#39;s mom and she said all his tests came back normal (EKG, et) and that the doctors may think it could have been due to anxiety from getting the vaccine. She was really appreciative of the call.

A 16-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 12:00 (at 16-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The caller is calling about her 16 year old son. She just left the doctor with her son who received his first Covid 19 vaccine. She would like to report an adverse event. Her son has had a fever of 105.2F (07Apr2021). The doctor just did blood tests, a rapid test for Covid that was negative, they tested him for strep throat that was negative and he doesn&#39;t have an ear infection. He&#39;s been running a fever over 105F for the past 2 days (07Apr2021). The caller wanted to rule out that nothing else is going on. They have called the Medical Director of (name)  and he didn&#39;t know what was going on with her son. If this fever continues she&#39;ll be calling Pfizer back. She is waiting on the results of his blood tests like his mononucleosis test pending and other viral and bacterial tests (unknown result). Her son started feeling bad about 4-5 days (unspecified date) after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. The last 2 days he&#39;s had a very high fever. He has a headache and body aches (unspecified date). He had a Covid 19 test not long before he received the Covid 19 vaccine and it was negative. She thought her son might have the Covid 19 virus but he had the rapid Covid 19 rapid test (09Apr2021) and it was negative. The caller does not know what is going on with her son. She took her son to a clinic because he was sick and because his fevers are too high. She also called the state but they told her that fevers are normal with the Covid 19 vaccine but if it persists after today, 09Apr2021, she needs to seek medical attention. It was further reported that earlier in the week her son told her he thought he was going to pass out at work (unspecified date). He told her he thought he had a fever but she checked it with a forehead thermometer and it didn&#39;t show a fever. Then on Wednesday, 07Apr2021, her son woke up around 4:30AM and had a fever of 105.2F with an oral thermometer. He woke Thursday, 08Apr2021 and this morning, Friday 09Apr2021 with a fever. His mother can control the fever during the day with Ibuprofen but he&#39;s spiking these fevers in the middle of the night. She knows fevers spike at night but she can&#39;t come with any other reason why this is happening. The patient lab tests and procedures also included CBC: pending, mononucleosis: pending, and rapid strep test: Negative; all from 09Apr2021. The outcome of events fever of 105.2f, headache, and body aches was not recovered; while for other events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He said he didn?t say anything  until his eyes were black and couldn?t see then he said he didn?t feel so good.  The color drained from his body and he went limp.  Luckily a nearby paramedic caught him and he was wheeled to a recovery room to be monitored. Patient felt better after 15 Mins but it was so scary.  We didn?t expect any reactions as hes gotten all of his immunizations and never had any reactions.  I was really traumatized by this whole event.  The staff there were very nice and helpful and helped us ease thru his recovery.  I wanted to report this incident so that way you have a log of adverse side affects from getting the vaccine.  I hope the 2nd shot will be ok.... I?m very scared at this point. TBD

Patient started to sway and lost muscle control.  I helped to the floor and laid him out.  Patient conscious whole time and never stopped breathing.  Did not lose cognizance.  Had momentary feeling of nausea that immediately passed.  Did not believe necessary to call 9-1-1 as patient did not exhibit any allergy symptoms of any distress during the whole episode.  Allowed to lay on floor for about 5-10 min.  Supplied patient with bottle of water to help with dry mouth and he drank and felt better.  After another 10 minutes patient was up on feet and feltmuch better.  Mother called an hour and a half later (about 5 min ago as I prepare this form) to inform me that he was back to 100%.

The patient appeared to having a moderate to severe vasovagal episode without total syncope. There did appear to be slight pseudoseizure activity present, however, there was no LOC or loss of bowl or bladder tone. The patient was placed in a supine position and moved to the monitoring area. With positional changes and aggressive hydration, he rapidly improved to baseline. He did endorse that he has had similar episodes with blood draws, etc.  He was returned home with his mother as the driver and with preventative instructions for his second dose.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after being administered with Pfizer COVID vaccine patient became lightheaded and almost fainted. Patient did not fall out of chair, but did slouch over in chair. The patient&#39;s father alerted pharmacy staff and the nurse administering vaccines today, and I went out to check on him. Patient was sitting up in chair at this time, but was very sweaty, pale and cloudy. Nurse instructed him to place his head down by his knees and provided him with water, Gatorade, and cold compresses. Once patient was feeling a little bit better we moved him into a private room with father and let him lay down at rest. When patient felt okay to leave he was advised to lay flat when he got home and eat. Father was also advised to stay with him until he was feeling 100%. Event lasted approximately 30 minutes.  A call was placed to parents around 3pm to check on him and he was doing well. (moving around and playing video games)

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  Patient is a 16 year old boy with ADHD who presented with fever and myalgias for 3 days, that progressed to sharp parasternal chest pain and some SOB. Patient received second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 4/26, and after that shot experienced fever to 102 at home and myalgias. Subsequently his symptoms of chest pain have occurred. He underwent workup revealing of elevated Troponin, and EKG with some ST segment elevation, a slightly elevated CRP at 32, and a normal ECHO. Admitted for observation and concern for infectious myocarditis vs MIS-C. Cardiac MRI was done confirming Myocarditis, Troponin I was elevated and peaked at 23, 325pg/mL. Workup unrevealing of SARS. Other testing showed Resp virus panel negative, blood pcr for EBV, CMV, Parvovirus B19, enterovirus, and adenovirus all negative, HIV antigen/antibody testing negative. Patient treated with Ketorolac with steady improvement in symptoms over several hospital days. Discharged home 5/2 with Troponin I well down and symptoms resolved. Given reports in lay press regarding other cases of COVID-19 MRNA vaccine associated myocarditis, we are reporting this as a vaccine associated adverse event.

He got the shot, I filled out his card, and directed him and his mom to sit in the waiting area for 15 mins in case of dizziness or a reaction. They were walking out of the room to the waiting area and he almost immediately fainted. He fell and possibly hit his head on the chair/ floor when he went down. (This was maybe 2 mins post-injection). He almost looked like he was going to have a seizure (arms were tensed up, his eyes were not focused, was starting to shake) but then he suddenly came-to. He seemed to be pretty coherent after he woke back up but 911 was called since he was bleeding

He was in his usual state of good health until 2 days ago when he experienced fever, chills and myalgias after receiving his 2nd dose of COVID pfizer vaccine. He improved until 5/2 when he developed a crushing, non-radiating, substernal chest pain which was waxing and waning in nature without specific alleviating factors. He had shortness of breath, but no palpitation, dizziness, or changes in pain on exertion vs rest. Family activated EMS who gave 325 mg of aspirin en route to the ED.   In the ED, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was mildly diaphoretic, but otherwise, unremarkable on physical exam. STAT EKG showed ST elevations in V5 and V6 and ST depressions in V1 and V2 as well as PR depressions, which persisted on repeated EKG. Given concern for myopericarditis, they ordered labs including CBC, CMP, troponin and inflammatory markers which were only remarkable for troponin of 1.94 and CRP 3.5. Chest x-ray was normal.    Cardiology was consulted and they recommended transthoracic echo which is pending. Cards also recommended starting Ibuprofen 600 mg q8 hrs and admission to cards for further management.

We called the pediatrician on call who recommended I take him to the ER.  At the ER, they performed two EKG&#39;s, a chest x-ray, bloodwork and an echocardiogram.  We were discharged from the ER 7 1/2 hours later with the following diagnoses: acute chest pain and acute pericarditis.  His treatment consists of taking 600 mg of Advil every eight hours for at least the next, laying low and not exerting himself for the next and following up with his primary care provider and seeing the pediatric cardiologist later this week.

As Medic approached, I helped patient to his feet and walked him over to a chair and sat him down, about 10 seconds after sitting him down he stated he was going to pass out, medic immediately braced patient and held him up and pt did go unconscious for about 15 seconds.  Pt quickly regained consciousness and was alert and oriented but still feeling light headed, he was helped to a wheel chair and taken to the cot area for eval.  Pt skins pale, cool, moist, pupils perrl, lungs clear bilaterally, vitals: BP 120/84, HR 52, RR16, SPO295%, pt asked if he has a slow heart rate and he declined, HR did return to normal at 82 BPM approximately 10 minutes later. PT kept on cot for 30 minutes, and felt much better after. Pt released to his father who stated that everyone in the family always passes out when they get shots.

The following day his throat was sore and he had cough and chest tightness.  He took an albuterol  neb which relieved the cough and chest tightness.  I saw him in clinic on 5/7/21.  His COVID PCR was negative.  His lungs were clear.  My assessment is that most likely his symptoms were related to a respiratory virus or seasonal allergies triggering his underlying asthma.  I do not suspect that his symptoms were related to the vaccine.

He started experiencing symptoms on 5/6/2021 morning a t06:07 AM.  He received his second dose of  Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 5/4/2021 10:: AM.  In the ED, CBC, CMP and UA was within normal limits. EKG at 20:46  and again at 21:14 showed  ST segment elevation in inferolateral leads with possible myocardial injury, ischemia or pericarditis.  Troponin 0 hour was 835 and at 2 hours 1674.  Patient was admitted to the PICU for further evaluation and management. Echo on 5/6/2021 showed normal LV systolic function with SF 31%  . Cardiac MRI on 5/7 showed contrast enhancement of inferolateral wall consistent with myo-pericarditis with small pericardial effusion.  Troponins were trended every 12 hours and plateaued in the 1800&#39;s on 5/8/2021. Patient was diagnosed with acute myo-pericarditis. Respiratory viral PCR and COVID-19 PCR on 05/06/2021 were negative. Thyroid studies were normal. ANA titer is pending. Viral serology for HbsAg was negative and HIV was non-reactive. Results for additional viral serologies for Coxsackie viruses, EBV, CMV and HHV6 are awaited. Patient was treated with  NSAIDs and Colchicine. IVIG was not given based on clinical judgement. Pediatric Cardiology was involved in patient&#39;s care and clinical decision making. Patient remained hemodynamically stable on room air throughout his PICU course. He was discharged on 5/9/2021 with Pediatric Cardiology outpatient follow up in 2-3 weeks. He will continue Ibuprofen 600 mg every hours and Famotidine 20 mg 2 times daily until his follow up.

                                                Child woke up at 3 am with severe nausea. Within minutes he complained about not being able to breathe. His lips turned blue and he was about to pass out. As I was able to keep him awake, I am not sure whether he would have had a febrile seizure (it very much looked like it) or just fainted.

He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

When I approached the patient, he was staring ahead at his mother while she informed me that he experiences similar reactions when at the doctors office when he receives any shot.  Before I approached he was passed out, but he was coming to when I arrived.  He was able to speak, look at me, and move without delay within a minute and showed no further symptoms.

No additional bleeding after initial episode.   Called pediatrics advice line that night but didn&#39;t recieve a call back.  Called again the next morning and spoke with nurse, she advised keeping watch but did not recommend further evaluation unless there was another episode or any additional potential side effects.  She agreed that I should report as potential side effect as he has not had any nose bleeds for about 11 years prior to this.

His chin was pinned to his chest, he struggled to breath and was making a sound as if he was loudly snoring but seemed to be struggling to breathe. I was unable to wake him. I&#39;m not sure how long it lasted but maybe 2 minutes or so. He woke up and asked what was going on as we had all been standing over him trying to unsuccessfully wake him.  He shared that he thought he&#39;d been asleep and had been dreaming. He also shared that his throat hurt very much. He had the shakes for about 30 minutes after and was extremely exhausted. He slept for 14 hours as soon as we arrived home.

                                                Shot given around 1125 am.  Pt and pt&#39;s mother went to sit in front of pharmacy.  At around 1135, pt fell out of chair, sounded/looked like he may have hit his head on blood pressure machine that he was sitting near.  We thought he had fainted.  Pt woke within 10 or so seconds after fall and was confused.  Said his head didn&#39;t hurt.  His skin did lose it&#39;s color and he was looking &#34;white as a sheet&#34;.  We had pt lie on floor and elevated his feet.  After a few minutes he was feeling better and was able to sit in a chair.   Pt and his mom left the pharmacy area about 15-20 minutes after pt fainted.  Upon looking at video of the event,  it appears that before the patient fell out of his chair that his right arm raises up and his elbow is bent in a very stiff way.  A split second later his whole body appears to stiffen and bend to the left, then he falls out of the chair and is lying on the floor.  When on the floor, his legs appear to be fairly stiff as well.  This whole episode seems to last about 10 seconds or less.  The video makes it look more like a seizure than a case of syncope.

Provided the patient with a cold pack for the back of his neck and water to drink, and encouraged him to sit with his head lowered. The patient&#39;s father pointed out that he had not had anything to eat that morning, which could have contributed to his response. After a few minutes, most of the symptoms abated, and patient was feeling much better. His father left the store with him at that time. Called the father later that day, and he said patient was feeling better. Had taken nap and was only feeling a little tired. I explained possible side effects from vaccine and father thanked me for our time and concern.

I shout &#34;call 911&#34; and held his head which tilt backwards with eyes rolling back.  together with his mother we lowered him to the floor and I supported his head at all times; as he was flat on the floor, he raised his own head and regained consciousness.  Both mother and I tried to talk to him and keep him awake when he closed his eyes, he was laying on the floor flat and talking until EMT arrived at 16:42.  EMT pulled him off the floor and took him to the ambulance.

And it has not stopped two weeks later. And I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m experiencing Brain fog however I do feel a bit slow in my mind not lethargic in my physical body.

Pharmacy staff came to his side and gave him wet, cold compresses and water.  He was feeling dizzy and clamy but never lost consciousness.  The pharmacist could see that the patient was wearing a CGM.  The patient was able to see his blood glucose levels on his receiver and they were high.  We were able to rule out hypoglycemia.  The patient threw up three times in the waste basket.  After about 20-30 minutes he started feeling better.

                                                17-year-old male who presents with 8 days of headache.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 4/21.  He felt like he had the flu after getting the vaccine and developed right-sided neck pain and a temperature to 100.  The patient did endorse being elbowed in the neck playing basketball during this time as well, as he played in a basketball tournament in right after this.  He got his Covid vaccine in his right deltoid.  He saw his pediatrician on 4/26 and a CT scan of his neck with IV contrast was done and this showed significant diffuse right-sided deep spatial neck edema and right-sided adenopathy.  The pediatrician discussed the findings with ENT who recommended augmentin and a medrol dosepak.  The patient developed a headache several days after this and went to urgent care for evaluation.  There was concern that the augmentin and steroids had caused the headache, so the steroids were stopped and he was switched to keflex on 4/30.  He was given phenergan and toradol at Urgent Care and discharged home.  His mom notes that several days ago he had fevers of 101-104.  He has not had a fever for several days now.  His headache continued and he felt unwell at basketball practice so he returned to urgent care on 5/4.  A CT scan of his head was done which showed right sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis as well as thrombophlebitis of the right IJ. He was sent to ED for further management at that time.  In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable and well-appearing.  The CTs were overread by our radiologists here.  The patient had some labs done at the outside urgent care but PT/PTT/INR and a CRP were drawn here, which were unremarkable.  A Covid PCR is negative.  Neurosurgery, neurology, and hematology were consulted.  Neurology recommended heparin and a hypercoagulable workup and hematology agreed with this plan.  The patient was admitted to the ICU for neuro checks and monitoring during initiation of heparin.

We took his blood pressure twice and his heart rate was 105 bpm..  Can not exactly remember blood pressure (seemed very off).  Took pt to the hospital where they measured his heart rate at 107 bpm.

He did improve a little bit 2 days ago but then started to feel worse yesterday and had a worsening cough that is resulting in some chest tightness. Cough is productive sounding. Mom describes it as barking. No appreciable wheezing but he sounds hoarse. He has some SOB after coughing repeatedly. He states it simply feels like it is hard to breathe for 10-20minutes after a coughing attack but then it resolves. He developed sweating yesterday as well. He states he will just start sweating for no reason. No measured fever. No chills. Today he has dried skin and cracked lips from blowing/wiping his nose all the time. No fevers. No vomiting.

                                                Patient was the 4th person to receive today?s vaccine of Pfizer. This was his second dose. He did fine the first dose. Patient sat down in the chair and rolled sleeve up. Chose L deltoid for injection site. He was talking with a friend and writer gave injection. Placed band aid. Patient was quiet and looked like he was going to get up but fell forward out of the chair. He hit his L forehead on side of wall. Writer caught patient and sat him up on the ground. Eye?s were dilated, he was diaphoretic, zoned out and not responding initially to voice, but eyes were open. Eventually got patient up to a wheelchair and taken to office area to lay down and monitor. Father was notified and sat with us after he arrived at the school. Patient drank 1 full 120cc orange juice and approximately 6oz of water. Throughout monitoring patient gradually felt better. Pupils corrected to normal, wasn?t diaphoretic anymore, and vitals improved. He stated this has happened before with lab draws and shots, but not this severe. Writer and colleagues informed him to notify people that are going to give him shots or lab draws about his history. Also informed him to notify his teachers if he feels anything out the ordinary for the rest of the day. Make sure he hydrates. Patient then sat up and walked in the room. He stated he felt fine like before getting the shot. Patient left stable and under his own power.

                                                Intense headaches the day after taking the shot, back pain from the waist up. 2 days later I woke up with chest pain and the lingering headache, my chest feels heavy and maybe shortness of breath. I did a bunch of research however I did not find anything about chest pain related to the second dose of Pfizer. I am not sure if it is some type of tissue or muscle pain or something more serious. When I massage my chest it does not ache like the muscle pain from my shoulder so id assume it has to do with maybe my lungs or heart.

                                                came to see me 3 days after his first Pfizer Covid vaccine and had been having a subjective fever, bad headache and stomach ache since the day the vaccine was administered. He incidentally had some weight loss noted at the visit over the previous 6 months for which I did some lab work. The lab work was normal except for his platelet count which was 111,000. A repeat platelet count done a week later was normal at 273,000. Because of the transient decrease in platelet count and the 3 days of bad headache after the vaccine, I decided to hold off on  getting a second Covid vaccine. Additionally and possibly of no significance, his mother apparently had a history of ITP during her childhood.

He was short of breath 5/6, and developed fevers that night along with vomiting. He was seen 5/6 with negative COVID19 PCR and documented fever to 104. Fevers continued, and he was admitted the evening of 5/10 with concern for myocarditis. See below for hospital course. Additional information for Item 18: ...Screening labs were notable for mild lymphopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and elevated inflammatory markers.  Given prior COVID infection, rash, and systemic inflammation, additional studies including troponin, D-dimer, BNP, and EKG were obtained.  EKG was reassuringly normal, however the D-dimer (2.48), troponin (1.27), and BNP (469) were elevated.  Other work-up included chest x-ray which was unremarkable, and right upper quadrant ultrasound with incidental cavernous hemangioma of the liver.

The rash was spread all over and well as the swelling. He swelled all the way to his toes. He also tuned white and became very lightheaded at the ER. They gave him IV Benadryl and dexamethasone and was sent home. It has been recommended by the ER doctors to not get the 2nd dose.

Noted the following day this his eyes looked yellow, more that usual, and came to the clinic on 3/1/21 for evaluation.  was feeling better but due to acute jaundice had blood work that indicated markedly elevated bilirubin and low platelets.  Further testing for hepatitis was negative.  Was sent to the ER the following day as we were unable to get blood drawn and GI consult was desired.  There he had a normal abdominal US and bilirubin had dropped and he has since been followed by GI and is currently being evaluated by Hematology for any underlying conditions that may be contributing.

                                                Patient presented to the emergency department early March 28, 2021 after experiencing 5-7 hours of chest pain. The chest started when the patient went to bed the evening of March 27, where he began having substernal non-radiating chest pain with inspiration. The pain was relieved by sitting upright and by taking some acetaminophen. He received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on March 25 (first dose was March 5). He was initially treated with ketorolac 15mg IV and given 1 liter of lactated ringer&#39;s solution via IV.  His chest pain resolved after this. He was eventually given colchicine 0.6mg twice daily and ibuprofen 600mg 3 times daily due to concern for myopericarditis. He was ultimately found to have no evidence of pericarditis after undergoing a cardiac MRI, thus colchicine and ibuprofen were discontinued. Due to findings of mildly reduced ejection fraction on imaging, he was started on metoprolol XL 25mg once daily at discharge.

                                                My healthy 18-year old son had his first dose of Pfizer, and within a few minutes he felt dizzy. His heart rate was also rapid. He didn&#39;t think much of it, but the dizziness persisted and so they had him lay down with feet up. After about 20 minutes, he began to vigorously shake (rigors I believe is what it is called.) He felt numb in both arms and also his tongue and mouth. We had 3 nurses attending to him, and after about 30 minutes they decided to send him to the ER for evaluation since the very strong shaking and other symptoms were worsening. The shaking, dizziness, numbness all subsided after about an hour. He was given a Zyrtec upon first symptoms about 15 minutes after dose. The ER doc doesn&#39;t believe it was an allergic reaction but potentially a strong vasovagal response and immune response. He felt tired after but was completely fine 2 hours later. We were discharged from the ER a few hours later after evaluation. Vitals were in normal range including blood sugar, blood pressure and oxygen. He was fully hydrated prior and had a turkey sandwich and orange prior to coming so was not low on food either. The shaking was very extreme and concerning. It has been almost 24 hours and he is feeling fine other than a sore arm.

EMS checked the patient and cleared him approximately 20-25 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

She stated patient looked gray and said his oxygen saturation was 78%. His blood pressure was 88/60. She poured cold water on his chest, thinking he could be overheated. She instructed another nurse to call 911.  A call went out over the walkie-talkie for a Charge Nurse to come to the scene at 1440. At this time the other nurse was already on the phone with EMS. When I arrived to patient around 1441, patient&#39;s oxygen saturation was 99% and pulse was 80. He was pale. He was talking coherently. He stated he had not eaten all day. I gave him some hard candy to suck on.  Around 1445, EMS arrived. They assessed him and determined he did not need additional care.  He signed EMS forms and the patient&#39;s brother drove him home. Patient was advised to make sure he did not go a whole day without eating before getting his second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Patient was being observed for 15 minutes after his shot. He reported that during that fifteen minutes, he blacked out for a few seconds. I took his BP and it was 126/75 and his pulse was 73. He drank a bottle of water and 15 minutes later, felt fine. I instructed him to follow up with his physician because he stated that this has happened before (not after a vaccine though).  Patient said he did just finish a tennis match and may be dehydrated.

Since then he has been to the Emergency Room 6-7 times for chest pain - workup is consistently negative He has seen two Cardiologists, a Neurologist and has had further workup.  It should be said that I feel it is probably not vaccine related and is likely anxiety related - however patient insists that it is related to the vaccine - he has never felt like this before.

                                                Approximately 11 days after receiving my first dose, I began feeling dull pain in my left calf. By Saturday, 4/17, the pain was severe enough to warrant a trip to the emergency room. After receiving an ultrasound of my leg, two blood clots were found in my left calf. One fully occluded a vein and another partially occluded a different vein.

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm at the age of 18-year-old on 07Apr2021 09:50 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing congenital diaphragmatic hernia (that prevented his lungs from developing before he was born). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (FLU) for immunization and without a reaction. Caller is a consumer, calling about his 18 years son who received the covid vaccine this morning and had an adverse event afterwards. Caller reported that his 18 years son had his first covid vaccine dose this morning. He has had all of his vaccinations, even the flu shot every year without a reaction. After having his covid vaccination, on the way home he said he started feeling light headed. He was supposed to go back to school once they got home but the caller noticed that his son hadn&#39;t left yet because he drives himself. He reported that his son&#39;s room is downstairs and when he looked his son was laying down at the bottom of the stairs and appears to have passed out. He reports that now he is fine and he has eaten. Calling now because he was concerned and &#34;wanted to make sure there was nothing else I should do in this situation&#39;&#39;. Caller stated that he took his two kids to get their vaccines. His son is 18 years old and his daughter will be 18 next Tuesday.Stated that they stayed at the site in case of a reaction to the vaccine and nothing happened. On the way back home the son became lightheaded. Caller thought maybe he needed to eat even though he had eaten a light breakfast before they went to get the vaccines. Stated his son got home and passed out. Caller had never seen his son pass out before. Said his son fell down the stairs while going to the basement where is room is located. Caller was concerned this could&#39;ve been a reaction and is calling to see if there is anything further they should be concerned about. The son&#39;s vaccine, lightheadedness, passing out, and falling all took placed today 07Apr2021. Caller said he nor his son are certain if he was injured during the fall. His son thinks he hit his head and his knee and noticed that his shorts where ripped behind the leg on 07Apr2021.  Caller states his son says he is feeling back to normal and fine. The son was supposed to go to school after the vaccine but the caller had him stay home so he could keep an eye on him. Caller stated it was scary. The caller opened the door and saw his son lying on the floor with the gum he had bought at the drug store strewn out everywhere. Caller stated they are believers in vaccines. Stated his son used to have a part time job at the grocery store bagging groceries for customers and was wanting to go back to work. Caller also said that his son was born with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia that prevented his lungs from developing before he was born. Caller stated that due to this him and his wife felt it was best for the son to get the vaccine since if he got the Covid virus it could have been really bad for him. Caller denies any medications, labs, testing or treatments that are relevant to these events. Caller stated his son is healthy. Stated when his son mentioned being lightheaded in the car, the caller didn&#39;t think much of it. The outcome of events was recovered on 07Apr2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Recipient received dose #2 vaccine today, and almost immediately had response with witnessed seizure-like activity, with posturing, tonic-clonic movement of his upper extremities, and eye movement with lateral nystagmus. Loss of consciousness was noted. Symptoms lasted approximately 15-30 seconds, and patient was placed in a reclined position. He regained consciousness quickly and became pale and diaphoretic. He was normally responsive and answered questions appropriately. Initial BP 74/32, HR 38, SpO2 98%. He drank some Gatorade and had improvement of symptoms gradually over 15-20 minutes. Repeat BP 100/58, HR 78. No past history of seizures. One prior syncopal event after pain response with sports injury. No prior difficulty with dose #1. After recovery, patient reported immediate pain with vaccine administration, then vision went blurry and he lost consciousness. Mother was driving the vehicle, and she witness symptoms as well as nursing staff in the vaccine pod. After recovery, options for further medical evaluation were discussed given complicated vasovagal response with seizure-like activity, mother called pediatrician to see if he could be seen, they recommended ER. Mother chose to drive by personal vehicle, rather than EMS transport. Symptoms were fully resolved and patient was transported to ER for further evaluation by personal vehicle.

SpO2 was 79% initially during this episode, but quickly bounced back up to 100% when he regained consciousness. EMS called due to possible airway involvement.  EMS arrived,, VS WNL at that time, however patient BP did not increase with postural changes (pt showed postural hypotension), so EMS transported him to local ED.  On 4/27/2021, I spoke with patient family to check in and patient mother reports that ED doc told her he was likely dehydrated and had a &#34;severe syncopal&#34; episode. Reports no adverse effects or expected effects from the vaccine and will likely return for his second dose. For second dose, our staff will ensure he is lying down supine for  vaccine administration.

An 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number and expiration date were not reported) on the left arm on 12Apr2021 (11:30) as a single dose, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included peanut and penicillin allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On12Apr2021 (11:45), the patient had loss of consciousness; seizure; drowsiness/could not stay awake; and vomiting. The events had resulted in an emergency room/department for urgent care, and were assessed as serious (medically significant). The patient was hospitalized in Apr2021 due to loss of consciousness. The patient had received epinephrine (EPIPEN) as treatment for the reported events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Apr2021. The patient did no have COVID-19 prior to the vaccination, and had not been tested post-vaccination.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He went to stand up and then blacked out, falling to the floor. He did not injure himself or experience any trauma in the fall. He did not lose consciousness. I believe he was experiencing increased anxiety from the event as the patient mentioned several times that he did not like needles/injections. The patient remained sitting upright for an additional 15 minutes, drinking water, and his mother escorted him out of the store and drove him home.

The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies to nickel and dust mites. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient developed severe chest pain between the night of 16Apr2021 to 17Apr2021, and was admitted to the hospital on 17Apr2021, diagnosed with peri/myocarditis. The cardiology team was convinced it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. He remains hospitalized (number of days of hospitalization was also reported as 2). The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, and hospitalization. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination which was a nasal swab with negative result on 17Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of peri/myocarditis which included ibuprofen, aspirin, and colchicine. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                I administered first dose of Pfizer covid 19 0.3 ml via intramuscular route to this patient. About 2 minutes after the administration, the patient had syncope for a second. When I arrived to the scene, the patient was conscious. When he passed out, he felt and landed on his head. He had an abrasion. He stated ?he felt hot and dizzy?. He hasn?t had anything to eat all day. Due to the abrasion, he was rushed to the hospital  About 3 hours later, I called to check on the patient. At the time of calling, the patient was discharged from the hospital in good condition. He stated he felt perfectly ok and wasn?t sure what had happened.

He initially had chest pain the day prior to admission with pain in his back and down his left arm. This improved with Tylenol and resolved prior to bed. On the morning of 5/6 the chest pain returned and was so severe it woke him from sleep. He was difficult for him to characterize, but he said it was all over his chest, sometimes sharp and pressure-like, most severe in mid substernal region and was so substantial that he had difficulty speaking properly. He feels that the pain is most severe when lying flat and is best managed when he is resting at a 45 degree angle. Patient was at ED he was found to have an initial ECG with ST depressions in aVR and elevations in II, aVF, and V2 through V6 raising suspicion for pericarditis/myocarditis. Initial troponin was elevated at 4.35 as well. Cardiology Dr. was contacted by ED physician, case discussed, and EKGs reviewed and felt this was more likely pericarditis, but not STEMI. Of note, he reports a family history significant for his mother having a?hole in her heart.?He was given Toradol with improvement in his pain and upon arrival to hospital his chest pain was markedly improved.  He was noted to have troponins peaking at 39.415 that down trended and an elevated CRP of 4.8 on admission. D-dimer was 0.26. Covid PCR was negative.  He was evaluated by cardiology again here who upon review of his ECG and cardiac enzymes as well as presentation was consistent with pericarditis. Echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function with trace posterior pericardial effusion and telemetry was monitored without any arrhythmias. He was started on low-dose beta-blockers, aspirin 650 mg 3 times a day, and colchicine 0.6 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses followed by 0.6 mg daily. He is planned to continue this for approximately 3 months and will need to follow-up with cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks for repeat monitoring and management with plan to taper off aspirin once his CRP normalizes.  Later that night, he even had a similar episode of sudden onset chest pain for which she received IV Toradol with minimal relief and oral Tylenol with relief of symptoms after that. No telemetry abnormalities were recorded at that time.   ECG the following day showed improving ST changes and troponin of 26.328 with CRP 4.2. He had no further symptoms for over 24 hours and is responding well to treatment.   He is advised to take Tylenol as needed in addition to the above-mentioned medicines should he have any recurrent chest pain.

                                                Patient (DOB 05-01-2003) received his 1st COVID vaccine (Pfizer, lot # EW0182 use by 5/15/21 at 0855) at 1539. The patient became pale approximately 30 seconds following the administration of the vaccine, EMT assisted the patient to the chair as he was standing up when he became pale, the patient loss consciousness for approximately 2 seconds. RN arrived at the station and assisted the patient to the ground, where he was placed in a supine position with his lower extremities elevated. The patients face mask was removed, he was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The patients color slowly returned to his face. Vitals were taken at 1540: BP: 155/70 (R arm, supine position), HR 70, RR 16, oxygen saturation at 97%, and pupils were equal. The patient had a history of fainting x 1 and his last meal was at 0800 and he stated, &#34; I didn&#39;t drink that much today.&#34; Denied any chronic medical conditions, was not currently taking any medications, and denied any drug allergies. The patient was moved to the anti-gravity chair and he was given pringles and Gatorade. Vitals were retaken at 1545: BP 162/80 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 50, RR 16, oxygen saturation at 97%. Denied any dizziness, headache, chest pain, or vision changes.  Vitals were retaken at 1553: BP 158/72 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 52, RR 16, Oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient was advised to eat a full meal prior to receiving his second COVID vaccine dose and to receive his 2nd dose in the anti-gravity chair. Vitals were retaken at 1558, BP 152/78 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 57, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient was also given a bottle of water, as he did not consume many liquids during the day. The patient&#39;s color fully returned to his face and he denied any shortness of breath, dizziness, changes in vision, or difficulty swallowing. Vitals retaken at 1603, BP 150/75 ( R arm, sitting upright), HR 60, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient called his mother to pick him up, as we strongly advised him to not operate machinery/ a vehicle after fainting. The patient&#39;s vital signs were taken at 1608, BP 140/75, HR 60, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient was advised to drink the entire bottle of water, as his blood pressure was slightly elevated and it was most likely due to being dehydrated, as he did not consume any fluid since 0800 earlier that day. The patient drank a bottle of water and his vital signs were retaken at 1614, BP 122/68 (R arm, sitting upright) and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. The patient&#39;s mother arrived on site around 1630 and spoke with RN and both EMT. RN instructed the patient about emergency precautions and to follow up with his primary care provider. RN also educated the patient about the importance of informing the healthcare provider about his history of fainting with the first vaccine, when receiving the second COVID Pfizer vaccine. Gave the patient V-safe information and reported the occurrence in VAERS. The patient had a steady and even gait when leaving the site with his mother at 1632.

An 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EW0169) at single dose, on 22Apr2021 at 17:30, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. Patient&#39;s mother reported that her son fainted within 30 seconds of receiving the Pfizer vaccine 1st dose and since then he had experienced some intermittent light headedness and dizziness. He passed out completely after shot. Adverse events were described as following: &#34;patient is due to get his second dose of the shot later this evening but is having periods of lightheadedness and dizziness. Patient&#39;s mother states that her son also feels like he is going to pass out. She states that this started 30 seconds after the first shot. Her son only passed out once, completely right after the shot, it was a bad experience. She&#39;s glad he actually wants the other one today, but he is concerned because he is still lightheaded and dizzy after 3 weeks. Patient&#39;s mother states that he has been trying to function, work, and live his life but its irritating to him and scary. The doctor suggested that he should get his second dose but her son is a little fearful&#34;. Physician Office Visit required. The patient did not recover from intermittent light headedness and dizziness, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile and strong temporal relationship there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the reported events and the suspect drug.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

                                                Per patient he received his second Covid vaccine 3 days prior to arrival and immediately following developed myalgias, subjective fevers and &#34; viral symptoms&#34; which she managed with ibuprofen 2 tabs q6h some improvement.  On the day prior to arrival he developed increasing shortness of breath particularly with talking and with ambulation.  He also describes chest tightness with deep inspiration, the tightness radiates to back, no radiation to left arm or jaw.  Chest tightness is non-positional, but does feel worse immediately after he lies down from ambulation and then slowly dissipates.  His last subjective fever was yesterday evening.  He has never had a reaction to the vaccine before.  He has no allergies.  No prior medical conditions he is aware of, and takes no medications.  He did not experience any of the symptoms following the first vaccine. He has h/o asymptomatic COVID infection in November 2020. Cardiology consulted for concern of pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccine. He does not have significant ST elevation or PR depression.  He also does not have evidence of significant pericardial effusion at this point.  The high sensitivity troponins are mildly elevated.  He does have viral syndrome.  Is unclear if Covid vaccination was causally related to his symptoms.  We would like to improve his medications for better chest pain control and to prevent recurrent pericarditis in the future.

A 19-year-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 25Mar2021 (received at the age of 19-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing seasonal allergies and cardiac murmur he had as an infant. When probing medical history, the consumer reported that as an infant, her son, had a heart murmur. Her son saw a heart specialist in (State) who did an ultrasound/sonogram of her son&#39;s heart. The specialist said the heart murmur was fine and nothing needed to be done. She also adds that for family medical history, she and her husband don&#39;t have any early onset heart issues in either side of their families. She also reported that her son has horrible seasonal allergies. Concomitant medication(s) included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; triamcinolone acetonide (NASACORT) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; montelukast (MONTELUKAST) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The reporter stated that her son (patient) had a heart attack (26Mar2021) after receiving the first dose of bnt162b2. The patient also experienced heart failure on 28Mar2021 and had fluid in his lungs on Mar2021. She called regarding the COVID-19 vaccine on behalf of her 19-year-old son who received his first vaccine on 25Mar2021. Her son received his first Covid 19 vaccine at a PRIVACY where he attends college. On Friday, 26Mar2021, he was feeling crummy, on Saturday, 27Mar2021, he was feeling crummy. On Saturday night, 27Mar2021, her son started texting her around 11:30PM saying he had pain in his left shoulder and left arm. He had already taken 2 Advil and it wasn&#39;t helping with the pain, her son asked if he could take a third Advil. The reporter told her son he could take a third Advil because it had been an hour and a half since he had taken the first two Advil. The texts from her son continued. He was getting no relief. He took a hot shower and tried self-massage and warm compresses. He ended up throwing up and he said he felt a little better. Her son tried to lay down and couldn&#39;t get any relief from his pain. The pain was tremendous in his left shoulder and arm. Her son told his mother, he thinks he needs to go to the emergency department. His mother is two hours away from him and told him to call 911. Her son had a friend take him to the emergency department instead of calling 911. Her son went to PRIVACY. While at the emergency department, the doctor thought that her son&#39;s pain was muscular. Her son received an injection of Toradol. Her son was discharged from the emergency room and went back out to his friend who had brought him to the hospital. Her son and his friend didn&#39;t even make it out of the emergency department parking lot when her son suddenly couldn&#39;t see anything. His eyes were wide open and all he could see was black. His ears started ringing. Her son went back into the emergency department. Her son received Benadryl and an Epi-pen thinking maybe he was allergic to the Toradol and having a reaction to the Toradol. Her son had blood work, an EKG, and vital signs done in the emergency department on 28Mar2021. His blood work were over 3000 which the reporter reports, indicates a heart attack. The emergency room doctor did not think the Toradol would have pushed his Troponin levels that high. With her son complaining to her about the pain in his left shoulder radiating into his left arm and throwing up, those are signs of a heart attack. Her son was maybe playing off the seriousness of the pain he was experiencing. It was agreed at that point it might be her son&#39;s heart. She was about 18 minutes away from the hospital when she received a call from the hospitalist, the doctor taking care of her son. And that doctor tells her that her son is not doing well and is not responding to treatment of the bag of saline fluids. The doctor is trying to get her son&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate back up. The doctor was afraid he might have to air flight him to the PRIVACY hospital. She told the doctor she is 18 minutes away and asked if he can wait that long or does she have to turn around and drive the opposite direction to the PRIVACY. At this point her son was having a COVID-19 viral test in case he needs to be transported to the other hospital. The doctor tells her that her son can wait the 18 minutes until she gets to the hospital. She arrived at the hospital and wanted to see her son, her son is on high flow oxygen and she has to gown and glove up to be in his room for fear of Covid particles since he&#39;s on the high flow oxygen. His COVID-19 viral test results have not come back at this time. Her son was admitted to the hospital for heart failure. He was in the hospital for 5 days. He was admitted in the wee hours of the morning on 28Mar2021. During the time he was in the hospital he had chest x-rays and he was given Lasix to get the fluid off his lungs. His white blood cells were way up so he was given an antibiotic. He had an MRI, Chest X-rays, and a Heart Catheterization through his wrist that would indicate that he had blocked arteries in his heart. He had no blocked arteries. The heart catheterization revealed an artery going into his 4th heart chamber was slow to open and close. The cardiologist prescribed Metoprolol for six months with monitoring. The cardiologist feels the Metoprolol will repair his artery and get his blood pressure and heart rate numbers where they need to be. He was admitted to the hospital at around 3:00AM on 28Mar2021 and was discharged on 01Apr2021. Her son&#39;s COVID-19 viral test came back negative, but his COVID-19 antibody test showed that he did have COVID-19 antibodies. The doctor didn&#39;t know if that meant that her son had a previously undiagnosed case of the COVID-19 virus or if he developed COVID-19 antibodies that soon after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. She reported when her son was discharged, he was feeling better, but still had residual fluid at the bottom of his lungs. Her son did have to go for a chest x-ray on Tuesday, 06Apr2021, after he was discharged, to make sure the fluid was making its way out of his body. When he was discharged from the hospital, he had some shortness of breath and he was tired and weak feeling. The pain in his left arm began before he was admitted to the hospital. The shortness of breath started during his hospital admission. At this point in time she would say her son has improved. The Metoprolol he was prescribed by the cardiologist is one half of a 25mg tablet once at nighttime. She stated that she does not have any information on how low her son&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate were during his time in the hospital. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the adverse events. Outcome of the events was recovering.

Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

Patient was admitted into the hospital for 2 days (4/27-4/29) for this substernal chest pain. A CTPE, EKG, and CXR were ordered that were unrevealing as to the etiology of the chest pain. Troponins were elevated on admission with a slightly decreased delta (515-&gt;479). An ECHO was ordered that showed a LVEF of 35-40% with moderate global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, right ventricles moderately dilated, and no pericardial effusion.  A Cardiac MRI was then ordered to determine etiology that showed subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement of the basal inferior and mid-inferior and inferoseptal wall consistent with acute myocarditis. Additionally, a small pericardial effusion without signs of inflammation, calcification, or cardiac tamponade physiology. Patient was then D/C on 4/29 after the cardiac MRI with no medical therapy with the recommendation to not partake in physical activity for one month. Will have follow up with cardiology clinic in 1 month and will participate in cardiac rehab.

                                                When reviewing forms with patient the patient disclosed a shellfish allergy. He described the symptoms of his skin turning red, shaking, and swelling in his throat as swelling in the past. He indicated that he had needed to use an epi pen in the past for his allergy.  He still wanted the vaccination and knew we had an epi pen handy.  He was given the vaccination in his left arm and was set up next to the staff development employee who was timing and monitoring patient&#39;s for symptoms. An epi pen was given to the monitor so it would be handy.  The patient&#39;s right hand started shaking within a minute and it was hard to tell if it was from being anxious.  Patient continued to communicate verbally and stated he wanted to use the epi pen.  911 was called by the staff and the staff member with the epi pen took it and the patient out of the main area. Paramedics transported him to the hospital with slight tachycardia and never did administer epi pen while in facility. Patient was always conscious and able to verbally communicate.

This was followed by chest pains.  These chest pains prompted him to seek care in the ER.  Upon workup, I found the patient to have developed myocarditis with a significantly elevated troponin prompting hospitalization.

                                                The patient appears to have developed acute myopericarditis within 3 days of receiving the vaccine.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 22-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/ Lot Number and expiry date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 (at the age of 22-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food or other products. Patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks of vaccination. Patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Patient has not COVID, prior vaccination. On 03Apr2021, the patient appears to have developed acute myopericarditis within 3 days of receiving the vaccine (adverse event result in Emergency room/department or urgent care). Patient received treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and colchicine. Patient has been tested for COVID in 2021, post vaccination, Test type: Nasal Swab and result was negative. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Additional information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the known vaccine safety profile the causal association between the reported event patient appears to have developed acute myopericarditis within 3 days of receiving the vaccine and the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 is unlikely but cannot be completely excluded because of strong temporal association between the event and the suspected vaccine. The case will be assessed once the new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Passed out; pounding headache/headache symptoms are getting worst; body ache; tiredness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 22-years-old male patient (Son) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. My son is having a tough time with the vaccine. Everyday he has a couple of side effects. He started with body ache and tiredness on unspecified date Apr2021. He had a pounding headache. His headache was moderate today. However, the headache symptoms are getting worst. Generally, the symptoms last a day his have been getting worst for 7 days. He has been taking Tylenol and Advil. But the Advil doesn&#39;t even seem to hep anymore.&#34; headache is a common side effect reported with the vaccine. If the symptoms persists or get worst please consult your HCP. Please note blood clot has not been associated with the vaccine. Patient is been experiencing what I considered to be pretty severe, I guess reaction in term of aches and headache. This morning he woke up with the pounding headache, he kid described it as pounding and I just I guess I want to ask because everywhere I read, it says mild headaches are common and aches and I understand that but I guess understanding why this, this is considered somewhat as severe reaction or is there anything he can do to alleviate the symptom and should he, I guess my question is actually I guess my question also is should he not possibly get the second dose if he is experiencing such bad headaches with the first dose. When paraphrased the concern, reporter stated, Yes, basically we are thinking if can do to alleviate it and then he could not get the second dose, if you have any advice, I guess and just let you know he went to his health center in the college he went to get a COVID test and a flu test just to make sure he doesn&#39;t have actual Covid or flu and those report I got yesterday and so they told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. When probed for event start date, reporter stated, I would say a day after, I would say 09Apr2021, I guess it&#39;s phantom (not clarified) with symptom, the first day he was just tired, as far as the headache that started on the 09Apr2021. He (son) also passed out after the vaccine, which I also did that I didn&#39;t have Pfizer I (reporter) had Moderna and I had that same reaction, so I think that sometimes happens to some people but that&#39;s it happens also. When probed for vaccination anatomical site, reporter stated, Outside of the body I guess, I don&#39;t know that for sure. Patient still having the problem (event), and out event outcome, reporter stated, Yes, I think persisting, I think it varies. Patient has been taking Advil (Ibuprofen) and Tylenol (treatment). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included influenza virus test: negative on 12Apr2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 12Apr2021. They told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of body ache (pain), tiredness (fatigue), pounding headache/headache symptoms are getting worst (headache). The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  QR Comment: Call handler not filed split case. Might have been split case.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

He then became very pale and fainted while in the vaccination chair. After a few seconds he regained consciousness. We then helped him to the floor and elevated his legs and placed a cold pack on his neck. He started feeling better instantly but we kept him there for about 5 minutes. We then had him move to a chair and the technician sat with him for an additional 40 minutes. He then said he was fine and that he has fainted before (which was not disclosed) and left.

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EN6206) single dose, in the left arm, on 08Mar2021, at 11:45 AM, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had not received any other medications within 2 weeks. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not experienced COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Mar2021, at 12:00 PM, 5 minutes after vaccination, the patient became very light-headed. In a few seconds his vision went dark and he passed out. After an unknown amount of time, he became semiconscious and was hyperventilating. While hyperventilating, his eyes were open, but he could not see anything. Once he caught his breath, after about 15 seconds, his vision came back and he lost all awareness of where he was. After about 30 seconds, the patient realized he was in the observation area for the facility and alerted the medical professionals near his vehicle he was sitting in. Medical professionals checked his vitals, which were fine other than an elevated heart rate, and he had a tingling sensation over his body for the next two minutes. In this time, he was unable to form cohesive sentences, and his muscles movements were impeded. It took another 40 minutes to return to a relatively normal state. No treatment was received. The patient recovered from the adverse events. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                About 7-10 minutes after recieving the vaccine, my heart rate increased and I started to become extremely anxious. Was on the verge of a panic attack but was able to calm down. For the rest of the day I felt anxiety, slight chest pressure and measered a blood pressure of 153/88. The day after I went to to urgent care jsut to check if anything was wrong. My blood pressure was elevated during this visit with a mesaurement of 134/79. Was told that for the next shot to tell the vaccine staff about my reaction and to wait for 30 min instead fo 15 min.

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

                                                On Saturday night (4/10) I had some chest pains that seemed to not go away in my upper left chest and left arm. I tried to sleep it off until the pain was unbearable at around 7:00 am on Monday (4/11). I then admitted myself to the ER and was given an ECG and multiple EKG?s as well. Upon lab results I had high triponin levels (28) leading the doctors to believe I had a heard attack of some sort, eventually they ruled it as acute pericarditis possibly due to my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

A 23-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 at 1 pm (around 12:20ish as reported) (Lot Number: FN6206) (at 23-year-old) at single dose in arm right for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history relevant to AEs. The patient stated he is a pretty healthy guy. All day after getting the vaccine he was fine. He got the shot at like 1 came home took a nap, ate some dinner, and was playing XBOX with the boys when this happened. At around 10:30 pm on 29Apr2021 he went to rub, his stomach just above his belly button and it hurt. He said that he read on line that that area is called the pancreas or liver, it has a lot of names for that area when looking online. He stated it&#39;s the left upper abdomen area he felt pain when he pressed on it. It radiated really fast across his abdomen while he was on the phone with mother. The more he pressed the more the pain got sharper, and it radiated right across the abdomen, mainly above belly button not too much in lower abdomen, not much in upper abdomen. It was very sensitive. He didn&#39;t have to press hard to trigger the pain. It was almost like the area was inflamed. It happened really fast and that it was his upper stomach not so much the lower part of his abdomen. He felt dizziness and nauseous and like a silly boy he tried to run to the bathroom. He stated that he fell and fainted. His butt was still a little sore from falling. He said when he woke up, he was sweating like he had been out side all day. He did not recall sweating any time he fainted in the past. The side effects were gone after about ten minutes. He was really light headed and had the crazy sharp pain in abdomen for about ten minutes and then it was gone. He had never had that kind of pain. He was laying on the floor for a couple minutes. He went to get his phone, and then sat back down and was sweating. He still had pain at that time but it only lasted about 10 minutes at most. He was still a little bit sore in some joints which was not unexpected. He confirmed that he had a little bit of sweating, and he fainted a little bit. Since the episode he hasn&#39;t felt any symptoms like that before, he has not had any pain like gastritis but he has had some random gastrointestinal things before. It&#39;s also reported nausea on 29Apr2021. No required to emergency room and physician office. He was on the verge of going to the ER while the pain was there. He was going to go until it stopped and to get checked out. No relevant test. The outcome of the events sore joints, dizziness and butt sore was unknown; for other events was resolved on 29Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient walked out fine after receiving the vaccine. Was able to walk up to the registration desk and carried a conversation with the staffs. He sits down in the waiting area to be monitored. We heard his phone dropped, looked up and saw him tilting over on the right side was about to fall off the chair. Staff grabbed him and held him back onto the seat, proceeded to picked up his right arm and held him in place. He looked unconscious while staff held him. He came back to his senses approximately 10 seconds later. After he regained consciousness, staff took his blood pressure which was 111/44, SpO2 was 100%, and heart rate 58. Patient looked pale but not critical. Conversed with our staff and stated that this has happened before when he receives other vaccinations. Patient&#39;s father is a physician and reported that the patient is scared of needles and did not need any medications from anaphylaxis kit or crash cart. We gave him water and he left after sitting for a while.

                                                On Friday morning 2/26/21, we had a 24 yo male patient who had an anaphylactic reaction after his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He was instructed to wait on the chair, but had stood up at some point but was still in the pharmacy waiting area. A team member noticed he had fainted and called for help. The pharmacist on duty and immunizing tech came immediately to help him to a chair. At that point, he was conscious and talking. Then within a few seconds he started convulsing on the chair and lost consciousness. His eyes were open and head tilted back. A team member immediately called 911 and pharmacist administered 0.3mg Epipen to the thigh. We removed his face mask to check his breathing and also to allow him to breathe more easily. We also adjusted his head more forward and he started coughing. After about 15 seconds, he regained consciousness and could answer questions. EMT arrived soon after and took over. Patient does not have allergies or any history of anaphylaxis/ severe reaction from vaccinations. He did express some fear of needles and did not eat breakfast yet.

I was then moved to the observation area where my chest got tight, I had difficulty breathing and my temperature fluctuated which made me shake. When hives began to show on my face, neck and ears the on-site medical staff gave me a shot of epinephrine and Benadryl and put me on oxygen, during this time an ambulance was called by the staff. When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

                                                got up about 5:15AM to use the restroom, parents heard a huge crash and we came running - he had collapsed and fainted in the bathroom, against the toilet, (with shelves and glass crashing down him - he grabbed the shelves and had a few cuts and bruises), was unresponsive, no color in his face, could not stand or move, could barely speak - slumped against the toilet.  Parents called 911 and tried to get him to respond, he was listless but opened his eyes - we lifted him and moved him to recliner in living room.  Fire Dept./EMT&#39;s arrived within a few minutes, blood pressure was 87/43, glucose was normal.  EMT&#39;s determined it was a reaction to the vaccine and asked if he wanted an ambulance or if parents should drive him for further care - he opted for us to drive him (his Mom called the Dr. on staff first - Dr. said it was a reaction to the vaccine and he should not get a 2nd dose).  Patient&#39;s Dad took him to Urgent Care - they ran an EKG (normal), and stayed there until his blood pressure showed (although still low)  normal/acceptable again.  I looked at the CDC website for covid anaphylaxis and it appears it was an allergic reaction (cardiovascular), on the site, he had these symptoms:  &#34;Cardiovascular: fainting; hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure); pallor.  ... Symptoms of anaphylaxis often occur within 15-30 minutes of vaccination, though it can sometimes take several hours for symptoms to appear.&#34;

                                                DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 1. Chest x-ray that was normal. 2. CT angiography of the chest showing no abnormalities. 3. Echocardiogram showing no significant abnormalities.  HOSPITAL COURSE: A 24-year-old male, primary care patient, received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination 3 days prior to admission.  Following this, he had a fever, chills, body aches, and then developed severe chest pain.  The pain was worse lying flat, better when sitting up and leaning forward and worse with a deep breath.  He had gone to an urgent Care and was recommended going to the emergency room.  The patient&#39;s troponins were elevated and his EKG was fairly classic for pericarditis.  He was felt to have probably viral myopericarditis and was admitted for observation.  He was placed on aspirin and colchicine.  He seems stable from Cardiology to be discharged on this regimen as well as symptomatic treatment.  It was not known whether the COVID vaccine was implicated with this or not.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: CONDITION:  Stable and improved.  MEDICATIONS: 1. Colchicine 0.6 mg b.i.d. 2. Aspirin 650 mg t.i.d. 3. Oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg every 4 hours p.r.n. for pain. 4. Zofran 4 mg sublingual q.8 hours p.r.n. for nausea.  DIET: Regular.  ACTIVITY: As tolerated.  FOLLOWUP: With Cardiology on May 3rd.  If worsened pain, shortness of breath, or high fever, return for evaluation sooner.  In which case, steroids may be administered.

A 24-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158; Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eye allergy. Concomitant medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AMOXICILINA CLAV) taken for eye allergy from 12Apr2021. On 14Apr2021, he received the first dose of the vaccine about an hour ago and waited five minutes and went to the bathroom. He had a severe reaction while patient was in the bathroom, he started to feel dizzy, had a terrible headache and chills. He walked out of the bathroom at the store and fell out completely in front of the pharmacists. The patient also experienced weak with shilling (as reported) and started sweating. The pharmacists called 911 and the responders checked his vitals and blood pressure and all of that and everything was fine. Patient clarified he passed out completely for almost 5 minutes. Patient stayed there with everyone until, they were waiting to see how he was doing. He reported he was feeling much better now, still feel a bit dizzy, not 100% but not as bad as when it happened. It has improved and he definitely felt terrible at the time. He was monitoring himself at home to see if he notices something weird going on. He does not have a headache right now and was feeling much better. When he was having the effect, he was mentally sharp, and knew what was going on. He thought about letting himself walk outside the bathroom so he could be seen. He didn&#39;t lose track of what was going on and body reacted adversely. He remembered stuff and everything and he felt good. Patient stated the chills went away; however, would not say they went away completely, he was recovering. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office and the paramedic said it was not necessary right now because all the vitals and everything else seemed fine. There was no therapy received for the events. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the vaccine and no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of events feeling dizzy, terrible headache, chills was recovering; still feeling very sick was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

The night after my first dose at around 23:00 while falling asleep I shortly after having been asleep would wake up gasping for air.  Attempting to fall back asleep I felt the need to consciously make myself breathe, and when I would fall asleep no more than 5-10 after I would wake up gasping for air. This continued on until around close to 03:00 on 1/7/21. When I finally fell asleep around 03:00 woke up gasping for air around 04:45 and never fell back asleep. The next two nights, 1/7/21 and 1/8/21 I would have trouble falling asleep because these same apneic episodes were happening until around 03:00. The night of 1/9/21 I had no issues sleeping, and have had no apnea since those three nights.  These apneic episodes were followed by extreme anxiety from being unable to sleep fully (I worried moreso about not falling asleep than the apnea). Heart rate when counted ranged for 70s-80s and my normal HR while sleeping is around low 50s.

                                                I had chest pains that felt like tightness of my chest.  Friends and family said it sounded like a heart attack (despite being only 25 years old).  It hurt to sit up or maneuver my chest/rib cage in any manner, for example, a sit up caused extreme pain.  The pain was consistent throughout the day.  After it began to dissipate, it was only reproducible when my chest/rib cage was moved or had pressure put onto it. Went to the doctor, diagnosed me with costochondritis.  Received an anti-inflammatory shot.  Reduced the pain.  From initial pain to full recovery was about 3 days (if memory serves correctly, VSafe should have the correct dates as I responded accurately there).  A slight discomfort in my chest did occur after my second shot, but nowhere near the same amount of discomfort.

                                                Patient had just finished recieving his covid-19 vaccination from vaccinator. At the time of patients fainting I was mixing up covid-19 vaccinations when the technicians said we need you to come out here because a patient is having a seizure, When arriving on the scene I found patient unconsious on the floor face down, while assessing the scene I noticed some blood on floor. I tried to look for any trauma, patient was breathing and I tried to awaken him. I told someone to call 911 and contact a store manager. Then all of a sudden he popped up and sat up like nothing happened. I then noticed the brusing on his nose and asked for an ice pack and a bottle of water. Patient knew his name, was coherent, and seemed to be fine. I stayed with patient until paramedics arrived. Paramedics did a thorough examination and everything checked out. Patient waited for parents to arrive instead of going with paramedics. Vaccinator stayed with patient till his parents arrived.

                                                Patient reported to clinic for Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination.  Patient did not indicate on questionnaire that he had experienced fainting or severe reactions from receiving vaccinations before. About 5 seconds after receiving vaccination patient said he would like to sit for just a minute.  The clinic had a designated waiting area about 25 feet away where patients sit for 15 minutes after receiving vaccination.  My technician and I agreed that patient should stay seated in the same chair he was receiving the vaccination in so we would be right next to him.  After 2-3 minutes I noticed the patient had his eyes closed and then his head began to nod and he started to slump down in the chair.  As I went to patient&#39;s side to stabilize him he pushed his chair backwards away from me about 5 feet which caused him to roll to the right side of the chair and fall off hitting his head on the floor. My technician immediately called 911 and EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes.  A bystander who was a nurse helped me roll him onto his back and we propped his legs up with 2 cushions.  We took his blood pressure and pulse. Patient regained consciousness in about 30 seconds and the EMTs cleared him to stand up after about 15 minutes.  After patient had recovered, patient&#39;s mother who was there with patient and other siblings stated that the whole family has fainting episodes when receiving vaccinations.

                                                On Wednesday April 14th I got my second vaccination shot. The following day I had a 103 F fever, body aches, chills, migraine, sore muscles, couldn&#39;t walk, excessive thirst. Those effects lasted all day and I felt better on Friday. Saturday night chest pain started along with sore arm getting worse. I took ibuprofen and melatonin to sleep. Woke up Sunday morning and pain came back and gradually got worse until I went into the ER around 9 am. They gave me Morphine to put the chest pain at bay. Then transferred me by ambulance to a different hospital with a cariology department. They treated me as if it was Myocarditis and also got an x-ray of my chest. The next morning I had an MRI and that is what confirmed it to be Myocarditis. I was then discharged with lots of medications to keep the inflammation down.

                                                The patient reported that they were experiencing tightness in their arm and believed it swelled initially. They left the pharmacy area and went to get Tylenol that was recommended by the pharmacist. They then began to get lightheaded and had syncope, attempted to get back up and the cashier asked to if they wanted to sit, but fell again. It was not clear initially to the employee who was helping them they had received the vaccine. 911 was called and the employee helping them let the pharmacist know they had just gotten their vaccine. The immunizing pharmacist went to check on the patient. EMTs were already helping the patient and had taken his blood pressure which was normal the lightheadedness had stopped and both sitting and standing blood pressure was the same. He had an elevated heart rate per the patient but didn&#39;t know any of the numbers the EMTs had taken. His father was driving him. He was not experiencing any symptoms and the injection site had no swelling and was otherwise unremarkable.
