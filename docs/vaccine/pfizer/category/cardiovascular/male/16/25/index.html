His mother gently lowered him to the ground (@ 1804). Patient&#39;s mother stated he just passed out and that this was his first injection ever in his life. Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient&#39;s legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling &#34;a star&#34; on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%. Immediately after the patient passed out the second time, his pulse was measured at 38 bpm and his lips displayed slight cyanosis. His pulse quickly rose to 52 bpm, within less than 10 seconds. One minute later his pulse was up to 68 bpm.

                                                High blood sugars for a week now.  My son is 16 year&#39;s old and was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in November.  He is thin and active, and an otherwise healthy teen and runner.  He is in his &#34;honeymoon phase&#34; of diabetes and I think the vaccine may be killing off beta cells.  He went from having blood sugar levels in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s at 12 units of Lantus to now 120&#39;s to 130&#39;s and up to 160&#39;s immediately after the shot.  His mealtime insulin is also not working at the same number of units and he&#39;s going in the 200&#39;s when he was around 160&#39;s before the shot. It has lasted now for a week instead of the 48 hours I was told about and read about.   As soon as we were leaving from getting his vaccine, he started experiencing extreme fatigue.  That night and for 2 days he had a headache.  He is still more tired than usual and having to take naps.

                                                vasovagal syncopal episode after receiving his first COVID vaccine.  Patient became nauseous and began to perspire.  He was able to respond to verbal commands, and never had complete LOC.  We were able to provide oral hydration and cold compresses.  After 15 mins I was able to have him sit in a chair, where he stated he was feeling much better.  After a total of 45 mins, he was able to walk out of clinic independently

                                                Patient was nervous upon receipt of vaccine.  It was an unscheduled (expiring) dose.  Per parent, he had fallen asleep outside vaccine room and they had to wake him up to get vaccine.   I gave immunization and asked him to stay for 15 minutes afterwards.  His Mom ran to consult window to notify staff patient was passing out.  I was sanitizing vaccine room so I immediately ran to him and his Dad and I caught him as he was slumping over.  He was shaking really hard, weak, and clammy.  He was coherent b/c I asked him his name but did not have clear recollection of timing of vaccine.  He was very pale in color.  His Mom grabbed him a Gatorade and he seemed very thirsty as he was drinking.  He mentioned he felt dizzy and that both arms were hurting and the arm I gave vaccine in felt like he had sweat dripping off it.  (I felt his arm and it did not).  I grabbed an instant cold pack and placed on his neck to help cool him off.  His color returned over the 30 minutes.  I asked parents if they wanted me to call ambulance but they wanted to wait and see how he responded.  He looked at his iPhone data and his heart rate had spiked.  Unclear if right before vaccine or right after but I believe he mentioned it went up to 120 when Mom said his normal resting heart rate was 60.  He ate some gold fish and seemed to perk up and have a few funny conversations showing his personality.  I explained to him very important to let parents know if he experienced any other side effects after leaving.  He was able to stand up and walk out of RX with parents.

After mom was vaccinated I had my bad to the patient and his mom throwing away supplies, Pt passed out and was not responsive to mom or to myself the pharmacist. I thought the patient needed an EpiPen and went to get the EpiPen out of the pharmacy and while my back was turned mom stated that the patient convulsed a few times. By the time I returned with the EpiPen pt was not convulsing and had passed out and started to recover and become responsive. Pt was pale but was aware of his name, birthday, date, and current president. A tech called EMS. Pt was talking when EMS arrived and color had started to return to normal. pt was able to walk out to the ambalance to be checked out. Mom stated she wanted to take pt to ER for more evaluation.

                                                Patient started to feel dizzy for about one minute. His father states that patient was sitting up on a chair and he started to fall backward, so his father caught him and lowered him to the ground. He did not hit his head. He was not responsive for approximately 10 seconds, per the father. Clinical monitors arrived and patient was alert and oriented to name, place, date/time. He was slightly pale and clammy but he denied any dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, headache, changes in his vision/hearing, or nausea.  He was laying on his back on the ground with his legs elevated on a chair and he started to feel better, and his blood pressure and oxygen saturation were stable with mild bradycardia per the vital signs obtained by one RN. He said he was feeling better and he was smiling and joking with staff. He slowly started to sit up and sipped bottled water. Stated that he had not eaten since 11am, and he agreed to a snack.  I left to get him a snack, and RN said that he started to &#34;zone out&#34; and he lost consciousness again for approximately 20 seconds. When I came back, he was sitting up, conscious, and had spit up saliva and water onto his shirt. His breathing was steady.   He again stated that he was feeling better very quickly, again in good spirits, but his father and I agreed that it would be best to call 911 to transport him to the ER just to be safe. He did not hit his head. He denied dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, changes in vision,  and headache. He was alert and oriented to name, place, and time. EMS was requested and they arrived, took his vitals, and he was transported to the Emergency Dept for futher care.   He and his father were confident that he would recover quickly as he had a history of syncopal episodes related to vaccines in the past.

                                                Pt was seated in the waiting area after receiving his first dose of covid 19. His parents who also received the vaccine were waiting with him. I was preparing another dose for patients waiting for their covid vaccination. I heard pounding on the clinic room and ran to check. The mom had knocked on the door because her son had fallen out of his chair.. when I arrived he was on the floor and his parents said he was regaining consciousness and moved him in to a seated position. At this point another customer was calling 911. I had my technician call management.  I observed the patient and asked if he was doing ok. His parents asked him if he was hurt and he responded in the negative. The patient was feeling cold and his hands were &#34;cold and clamy&#34; according to his mom so I held off on the cold compress. He wanted water but was also nauseous so I told the parents that I do not want to risk aspiration. We gave him a bag to throw up. I recommended that they take him to get seen when the paramedics arrived as I was concerned about him shaking before fainting. At this point the paramedics arrived and he was taken to the hospital as he was not feeling well. I followed up with the patient&#39;s mom and she said all his tests came back normal (EKG, et) and that the doctors may think it could have been due to anxiety from getting the vaccine. She was really appreciative of the call.

A 16-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 12:00 (at 16-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The caller is calling about her 16 year old son. She just left the doctor with her son who received his first Covid 19 vaccine. She would like to report an adverse event. Her son has had a fever of 105.2F (07Apr2021). The doctor just did blood tests, a rapid test for Covid that was negative, they tested him for strep throat that was negative and he doesn&#39;t have an ear infection. He&#39;s been running a fever over 105F for the past 2 days (07Apr2021). The caller wanted to rule out that nothing else is going on. They have called the Medical Director of (name)  and he didn&#39;t know what was going on with her son. If this fever continues she&#39;ll be calling Pfizer back. She is waiting on the results of his blood tests like his mononucleosis test pending and other viral and bacterial tests (unknown result). Her son started feeling bad about 4-5 days (unspecified date) after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. The last 2 days he&#39;s had a very high fever. He has a headache and body aches (unspecified date). He had a Covid 19 test not long before he received the Covid 19 vaccine and it was negative. She thought her son might have the Covid 19 virus but he had the rapid Covid 19 rapid test (09Apr2021) and it was negative. The caller does not know what is going on with her son. She took her son to a clinic because he was sick and because his fevers are too high. She also called the state but they told her that fevers are normal with the Covid 19 vaccine but if it persists after today, 09Apr2021, she needs to seek medical attention. It was further reported that earlier in the week her son told her he thought he was going to pass out at work (unspecified date). He told her he thought he had a fever but she checked it with a forehead thermometer and it didn&#39;t show a fever. Then on Wednesday, 07Apr2021, her son woke up around 4:30AM and had a fever of 105.2F with an oral thermometer. He woke Thursday, 08Apr2021 and this morning, Friday 09Apr2021 with a fever. His mother can control the fever during the day with Ibuprofen but he&#39;s spiking these fevers in the middle of the night. She knows fevers spike at night but she can&#39;t come with any other reason why this is happening. The patient lab tests and procedures also included CBC: pending, mononucleosis: pending, and rapid strep test: Negative; all from 09Apr2021. The outcome of events fever of 105.2f, headache, and body aches was not recovered; while for other events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Within 10 secs after injection patient said his body started having some adverse reaction.  He said he didn?t say anything  until his eyes were black and couldn?t see then he said he didn?t feel so good.  The color drained from his body and he went limp.  Luckily a nearby paramedic caught him and he was wheeled to a recovery room to be monitored. Patient felt better after 15 Mins but it was so scary.  We didn?t expect any reactions as hes gotten all of his immunizations and never had any reactions.  I was really traumatized by this whole event.  The staff there were very nice and helpful and helped us ease thru his recovery.  I wanted to report this incident so that way you have a log of adverse side affects from getting the vaccine.  I hope the 2nd shot will be ok.... I?m very scared at this point. TBD

The patient appeared to having a moderate to severe vasovagal episode without total syncope. There did appear to be slight pseudoseizure activity present, however, there was no LOC or loss of bowl or bladder tone. The patient was placed in a supine position and moved to the monitoring area. With positional changes and aggressive hydration, he rapidly improved to baseline. He did endorse that he has had similar episodes with blood draws, etc.  He was returned home with his mother as the driver and with preventative instructions for his second dose.

Patient started to sway and lost muscle control.  I helped to the floor and laid him out.  Patient conscious whole time and never stopped breathing.  Did not lose cognizance.  Had momentary feeling of nausea that immediately passed.  Did not believe necessary to call 9-1-1 as patient did not exhibit any allergy symptoms of any distress during the whole episode.  Allowed to lay on floor for about 5-10 min.  Supplied patient with bottle of water to help with dry mouth and he drank and felt better.  After another 10 minutes patient was up on feet and feltmuch better.  Mother called an hour and a half later (about 5 min ago as I prepare this form) to inform me that he was back to 100%.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after being administered with Pfizer COVID vaccine patient became lightheaded and almost fainted. Patient did not fall out of chair, but did slouch over in chair. The patient&#39;s father alerted pharmacy staff and the nurse administering vaccines today, and I went out to check on him. Patient was sitting up in chair at this time, but was very sweaty, pale and cloudy. Nurse instructed him to place his head down by his knees and provided him with water, Gatorade, and cold compresses. Once patient was feeling a little bit better we moved him into a private room with father and let him lay down at rest. When patient felt okay to leave he was advised to lay flat when he got home and eat. Father was also advised to stay with him until he was feeling 100%. Event lasted approximately 30 minutes.  A call was placed to parents around 3pm to check on him and he was doing well. (moving around and playing video games)

He got the shot, I filled out his card, and directed him and his mom to sit in the waiting area for 15 mins in case of dizziness or a reaction. They were walking out of the room to the waiting area and he almost immediately fainted. He fell and possibly hit his head on the chair/ floor when he went down. (This was maybe 2 mins post-injection). He almost looked like he was going to have a seizure (arms were tensed up, his eyes were not focused, was starting to shake) but then he suddenly came-to. He seemed to be pretty coherent after he woke back up but 911 was called since he was bleeding

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  Patient is a 16 year old boy with ADHD who presented with fever and myalgias for 3 days, that progressed to sharp parasternal chest pain and some SOB. Patient received second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 4/26, and after that shot experienced fever to 102 at home and myalgias. Subsequently his symptoms of chest pain have occurred. He underwent workup revealing of elevated Troponin, and EKG with some ST segment elevation, a slightly elevated CRP at 32, and a normal ECHO. Admitted for observation and concern for infectious myocarditis vs MIS-C. Cardiac MRI was done confirming Myocarditis, Troponin I was elevated and peaked at 23, 325pg/mL. Workup unrevealing of SARS. Other testing showed Resp virus panel negative, blood pcr for EBV, CMV, Parvovirus B19, enterovirus, and adenovirus all negative, HIV antigen/antibody testing negative. Patient treated with Ketorolac with steady improvement in symptoms over several hospital days. Discharged home 5/2 with Troponin I well down and symptoms resolved. Given reports in lay press regarding other cases of COVID-19 MRNA vaccine associated myocarditis, we are reporting this as a vaccine associated adverse event.

He told his family about the chest pain the following day, on 5/2,  which prompted his Mom to take him to an ED.  In ED on 5/2 and found to have ST elevation, elevated troponins and elevated inflammatory markers. ECHO with mildly decreased systolic function. Picture consistent with perimyocarditis. Admitted to Hospital 5/3 AM.  Currently clinically stable but admitted for close monitoring.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old young man presenting with chest pain admitted for myopericarditis.   He was in his usual state of good health until 2 days ago when he experienced fever, chills and myalgias after receiving his 2nd dose of COVID pfizer vaccine. He improved until 5/2 when he developed a crushing, non-radiating, substernal chest pain which was waxing and waning in nature without specific alleviating factors. He had shortness of breath, but no palpitation, dizziness, or changes in pain on exertion vs rest. Family activated EMS who gave 325 mg of aspirin en route to the ED.   In the ED, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was mildly diaphoretic, but otherwise, unremarkable on physical exam. STAT EKG showed ST elevations in V5 and V6 and ST depressions in V1 and V2 as well as PR depressions, which persisted on repeated EKG. Given concern for myopericarditis, they ordered labs including CBC, CMP, troponin and inflammatory markers which were only remarkable for troponin of 1.94 and CRP 3.5. Chest x-ray was normal.    Cardiology was consulted and they recommended transthoracic echo which is pending. Cards also recommended starting Ibuprofen 600 mg q8 hrs and admission to cards for further management.

                                                My son woke up with a upper backache in the middle of the night (5/3/21) and shortly after that he said that it felt like someone was squeezing his heart.  We called the pediatrician on call who recommended I take him to the ER.  At the ER, they performed two EKG&#39;s, a chest x-ray, bloodwork and an echocardiogram.  We were discharged from the ER 7 1/2 hours later with the following diagnoses: acute chest pain and acute pericarditis.  His treatment consists of taking 600 mg of Advil every eight hours for at least the next, laying low and not exerting himself for the next and following up with his primary care provider and seeing the pediatric cardiologist later this week.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving his vaccine, pt started to feel light headed on his way to the observation area, and sat on the ground.  As Medic approached, I helped patient to his feet and walked him over to a chair and sat him down, about 10 seconds after sitting him down he stated he was going to pass out, medic immediately braced patient and held him up and pt did go unconscious for about 15 seconds.  Pt quickly regained consciousness and was alert and oriented but still feeling light headed, he was helped to a wheel chair and taken to the cot area for eval.  Pt skins pale, cool, moist, pupils perrl, lungs clear bilaterally, vitals: BP 120/84, HR 52, RR16, SPO295%, pt asked if he has a slow heart rate and he declined, HR did return to normal at 82 BPM approximately 10 minutes later. PT kept on cot for 30 minutes, and felt much better after. Pt released to his father who stated that everyone in the family always passes out when they get shots.

He was standing up near the bleachers and an assistant initially brought a trash can over to him.  He was extremely pale and started to nod off as if he was going to pass out.  Chair placed so could sit down and instructed to breathe slowly and VSS obtained.  BP=122/70-98% spot oximeter-78 pulse.  He was able to drink some water and part of a cookie.

The following day his throat was sore and he had cough and chest tightness.  He took an albuterol  neb which relieved the cough and chest tightness.  I saw him in clinic on 5/7/21.  His COVID PCR was negative.  His lungs were clear.  My assessment is that most likely his symptoms were related to a respiratory virus or seasonal allergies triggering his underlying asthma.  I do not suspect that his symptoms were related to the vaccine.

                                                Child woke up at 3 am with severe nausea. Within minutes he complained about not being able to breathe. His lips turned blue and he was about to pass out. As I was able to keep him awake, I am not sure whether he would have had a febrile seizure (it very much looked like it) or just fainted.

                                                Patient received his 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine on Tuesday 4/27/2021; he had low grade fever (100.3 deg F) on Wed 4/28/2021. On Thursday 4/29/2021, he developed &#34;heartburn&#34;, and on Friday 4/30/2021 he developed chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

I added on Lyme disease and tick-borne illness as well as a Monospot type and screen.   Patient did receive his 1st visor vaccine for COVID-19 on April 29, 2021.   IV was established in the emergency department in consultation made to Pediatric Oncology.     I spoke with pediatric oncology in regards to patient&#39;s history and present illness.  He does agree that the patient should in fact be transferred under the pediatric care but recommended under the general hospitalist service.

No additional bleeding after initial episode.   Called pediatrics advice line that night but didn&#39;t recieve a call back.  Called again the next morning and spoke with nurse, she advised keeping watch but did not recommend further evaluation unless there was another episode or any additional potential side effects.  She agreed that I should report as potential side effect as he has not had any nose bleeds for about 11 years prior to this.

                                                &#34;The patient presented with symptoms of pericarditis and palpitations.  Evaluation revealed elevated troponin levels consistent with myocardial injury, ST elevation on ECG (consistent with pericardial inflammation) and short episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia that were not hemodynamically significant.  Echocardiography revealed normal anatomy and normal ventricular / valvular function with no pericardial effusion.  He was observed in hospital on telemetry for 24 hours and transitioned to outpatient care with exercise restrictions as well as oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and colchicine therapy.  Clinical diagnosis was peri-/myocarditis without ventricular dysfunction.&#34;

Lips became pale and face was pale. He was clammy to the touch on the back of his neck. His blood sugar at the time of injection was 113. He had not eaten breakfast yet. This lasted about a minute or so. He was finally able to say that he felt ok, but asked what happened. This happened a second time about 4minutes after the first time. But didn&#39;t seem to last as long. I gave him some juice and saw that his blood sugar was dropping to 85. Then a few minutes later his blood sugar was at 62. He continued to drink the juice and had 3 4carb glucose tablets. He started to feel better about 15 minutes later. He states that he felt numbness in his hands and feet initially. All feelings returned and color to his face and lips. His blood sugar began to rise again and he was feeling better. No hives or rash was noted on his body and the injection site was normal.

                                                Patient developed chest pain and difficulty breathing when lying down; symptoms started at 7pm on 5/21/2021.  Seen in the emergency room at Hospital  for chest pain, found to have elevated troponin level of 11.6 ng/mL (normal &lt;0.05).  CT chest negative for pulmonary embolism.  Patient transferred to Medical Center.  Initial high sensitivity Troponin-T level 1224 ng/L (normal &lt;15), BNP 805 pg/mL (nl &lt;300).  EKG with diffuse ST segment changes.  Echocardiogram (5/23 AM) with normal systolic and diastolic function, LVEF 58%; no pericardial effusion, no pathologic valve regurgitation.  Patient admitted to telemetry monitoring bed (no arrhythmias noted during hospitalization). Patient treated initially with Ibuprofen 400 mg PO q6 hours and famotidine 20 mg PO q12 hours for presumed myopericarditis.  Workup sent for viral causes of myocarditis: Respiratory viral panel negative.  Infectious Myocarditis workup sent: CMV, Cocksakievirus A and B antibody, CMV IgG/IgM, Echovirus antibody, Infectious Mononucleosis Screen, Lyme C6 AB IgG/IgM, Mycoplasma IgG/IgM, Parvo IgG/IgM, Varicella IgG/IgM.   Follow-up echocardiogram on 5/23 (PM) and 5/24 (AM) demonstrated no change in LV systolic or diastolic function.   Cardiac enzymes, including high-sensitivity troponin T, CK and CKMB, were trended. Cardiac MRI was performed - preliminary results show evidence of myocarditis Lab Trends (earliest to most recent, as of 1 pm on 5/25/2021):  High sensitivity Troponin T: 1224, 732, 664, 1058, 1332, 1141  CKMB: 65.6, 41.6, 19.3, 11.4, 6.3, 3.2  Pro-NT-BNP: 803,493, 392, 293  CRP: 58.2, 32.8, 28.6, 14.9.   At the time of sumission of this report, the patient remains in the hospital. Further results will be communicated to VAERS.

He had received his 2nd dose Covid vaccine (Pfizer) on Saturday 5/22, then had a fever to 103 on Sunday and then 101 on Monday measured by laser thermometer to forehead, associated with chills. Mother gave him Advil for fever. States he was awakened from sleep on Tuesday 5/25 at ~4am by a sharp chest pain. He describes a non-radiating, aching pain with some sense of pressure in the LUSB that initially lasted 2 hours. Once he arrived to Hospital it went away completely, but then returned several times after lasting about 30-60min each. Denies pleuritic pain, positional pain, dyspnea, or exertional pain. Tried Ibuprofen  which he feels helped, but then the pain returned 30min later. Also endorsed headache and fatigue.    At Hospital he had elevated troponin concerning for mild myocarditis.  EKG had diffuse ST elevation suggestive of possible pericarditis.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old male presenting to hospital as a transfer for chest pain and elevated Troponin levels concerning for myocarditis. Patient has otherwise been healthy. Two days ago he received his second dose of COVID vaccination. He initially felt fine, but later that day had some body aches. The next day he felt feverish off and on and had dull left upper sternal border chest pain intermittently. Today, he reports sharp 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, lightheadedness, sweating, chills, and intermittent non-productive cough. He presented to original hospital for evaluation. The patient admits to tactile warmth since Sunday with no documented temperatures. He recently received his second dose of Pfizer just before onset of these symptoms. He reports difficulty sleeping since Sunday, but no shortness of breath, rashes, syncope, nausea, or vomiting. He has not had any other recent illness, fevers, or known COVID-19 exposures. He denies any history of prior cardiac disease and there is no known family history of cardiac disease, arrhythmias, or sudden death in the child or adolescent period. He denies illicit or recreational drug use. In the ED, he was well appearing with pain now 1 out of 10. POC troponin was 16.8 ng/mL. He had labs pertinent for ESR 10, CRP 3.0, BNP 24. RP2 PCR was negative. UDS was negative except for opiates (s/p morphine). IV was placed and patient was started on IV fluids. EKG was obtained and showed questionable left atrial enlargement per ED read. Cardiology was consulted and performed Echocardiogram in the ED at bedside and was within normal limits. Cardiology resident team contacted for admission. Past Medical History: No major medical diagnoses Past Surgical History: Orchiopexy, T&amp;A Family History: No cardiac family history Social History: Lives at home with mother. Has two healthy siblings not living at home Immunizations: Up to date Medications: None Allergies: NKDA Etiology of likely myocarditis remains unclear at this time. In his age group, this would most likely represent a viral myocarditis. He would likely benefit from cardiac MRI during this admission for further evaluation of myocarditis. His EKG findings with his age group are unlikely to be secondary to myocardial infarct. No arrhythmias or heart block noted on EKG at time of admission or telemetry in ED. There is no family history of autoimmune disease or cardiac disease to suggest an autoimmune component or genetic etiology.

PCP directed him to be seen in the ED. Patient noted to have ST elevation on ECG with elevated cardiac enzymes (CKMB and troponin) thus was admitted to the PICU. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function. Troponin level increased further following admission, however CKMB started to trend down. Remained hemodynamically stable and did not require any significant interventions (IVIG, vasopressors, ECMO, steroids, etc). Chest pain resolved on admission to PICU.

                                                Two days later my grandson fainted, had a seizure and was taken to the ER. At the ER a CT scan of the head was performed. Also while getting an IV, my grandson also had a seizure. I do not have his CT scan results at this time. My grandson is also prepping for a surgery coming in June.

                                                myocarditis; chest pain; shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. This physician reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 06May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was none.  Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took ceftriaxone and received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) for COVID-19 immunisation.  On 08May2021, the patient experienced myocarditis, chest pain and shortness of breath.  The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to the events.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test (nasal swab): negative on 09May2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with ibuprofen. The patient outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association a contributory  role of  BNT162B2 to the reported myocarditis, chest pain and shortness of breath cannot  be totally excluded.  Additional information is needed to  better assess the report.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Patient had the normal expected symptoms on the 2nd day following his shot ... with sore arm, fever to 101, fatigue &amp; slight headache. He refused to take Tylenol that day, unlike his 14 year sister who had the same symptoms. On Sunday morning (the 3rd day) he woke up &amp; told us he was having chest pain &amp; shortness of breath. His sister was doing fine. So I gave him Tylenol at 10am to try to reduce any inflammation &amp; he still had a fever of 100. About an hour later his fever had reduced to 99 but he was still having slight chest pain &amp; shortness of breath ... mainly if he walked or moved around. He didn?t want to get it checked out but I called our insurance &amp; they agreed that he should go to the ER for testing so we went there at around 3pm. He had testing done including EKG, chest X-ray &amp; COVID-19 test which all came back negative &amp; other lab tests that also came back negative.  They gave him some meds &amp; about 2 1/2 hours later diagnosed him with pleurisy.  He still was having slight chest pain &amp; shortness of breath when we left at 5:30pm but throughout the evening was getting better. We gave him Motrin before bed &amp; another Motrin this morning before school, even though he said he was feeling better.

Workup revealed mildly abnormal EKGs and elevated troponins.  Cardiology consulted and Echo showed no evidence of myocarditis and bright pericardium without effusion c/w acute idiopathic pericarditis.  He was started on several days of motrin and pepcid.  Cardiology will see him in the office in 1 week.   The cause of pericarditis may be related to recent covid vaccination - this has been increasing reported after mRNA vaccines and affects teens and adults, primarily males.  Prognosis is very good with rest and NSAIDs.  Strict RTED instructions provided.  Normal activity allowed but NO sports or strenuous activity until seen by Ped Cards.

                                                Patient presented with chest pain initially with exertion on day one of illness (2 days post immunization), but by day 3 of illness (4 days post immunization) with acute onset midsternal chest pain that woke him from sleep.  Pain did not radiate,  he did not have any shortness of breath but pain with deep expiration. EKG performed in the ED showed diffuse ST elevations, and because of this patient underwent left heart catheterization.  Left heart catheterization performed showed normal coronary arteries, left ventricle dysfunction with apical hypokinesis and an estimated ejection fraction of 50%, elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 20-25 mmHg, and no evidence of aortic stenosis, insufficiency, dissection, aneurysm. . Initial troponin level elevated to 12.4, max troponin level of 31.3. Pediatric cardiology was consulted with recommendations to start ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. An echocardiogram was performed and showed mildly decreased longitudinal strain in the apex and inferior basal segments. Patient currently continued on ibuprofen 600 mg q6h, with improvement of troponin level.

A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15May2021 (Lot Number: EW0177, at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart murmur. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical Vaccine included 2 vaccines in Mar2021 (Caller said that her son had 2 vaccines in Mar2021 on his annual doctor visit, she did not have the names of the vaccines and then had a booster for the vaccine 4 weeks later. The booster was 14 days prior to receiving the Covid vaccine), and meningococcal vaccine on 01May2021 (at the age of 16-year-old, Caller said that it was a meningococcal vaccine. She thought there were 2 different meningococcal vaccines). Caller was a consumer that was calling on behalf of her son that received his first dose of the Covid-19 Vaccine. She said that she saw on the news recently that Pfizer was looking into reports that teenagers were developing heart issues after receiving the vaccine. The caller said that her son was 16 years old and received his first dose on 15May2021. The caller said that her son had a really small heart murmur. When they got home later that day after he received the vaccine on 15May2021, he said that he had chest pain. She said that he did not have a fever, but was very fatigued and very sluggish for a couple of days. She said that this had been on her mind since she saw it on the news. She was concerned if he should get the second dose on 05Jun2021 with his pediatrician. The caller also said that because he turned 16 in Mar2021, he recently had 2 other vaccines and he had a booster. So he had 3 shots prior to having the Covid-19 Vaccine. The caller said that he received the Covid-19 Vaccine after 14 days of receiving the booster. The caller said that the fatigue and feeling sluggish lasted a couple of days, but stated that he was still tired a lot. The caller said that her son also reported that he had a sore arm. She said that he noticed it a couple of hours after his vaccination and lasted about 3 days. He had completely recovered from the sore arm. The outcome of the event chest pain was unknown, of event fatigue was not recovered, of event sluggish was recovering, of the event sore arm was recovered on 18May2021.

His chin was pinned to his chest, he struggled to breath and was making a sound as if he was loudly snoring but seemed to be struggling to breathe. I was unable to wake him. I&#39;m not sure how long it lasted but maybe 2 minutes or so. He woke up and asked what was going on as we had all been standing over him trying to unsuccessfully wake him.  He shared that he thought he&#39;d been asleep and had been dreaming. He also shared that his throat hurt very much. He had the shakes for about 30 minutes after and was extremely exhausted. He slept for 14 hours as soon as we arrived home.

                                                Shot given around 1125 am.  Pt and pt&#39;s mother went to sit in front of pharmacy.  At around 1135, pt fell out of chair, sounded/looked like he may have hit his head on blood pressure machine that he was sitting near.  We thought he had fainted.  Pt woke within 10 or so seconds after fall and was confused.  Said his head didn&#39;t hurt.  His skin did lose it&#39;s color and he was looking &#34;white as a sheet&#34;.  We had pt lie on floor and elevated his feet.  After a few minutes he was feeling better and was able to sit in a chair.   Pt and his mom left the pharmacy area about 15-20 minutes after pt fainted.  Upon looking at video of the event,  it appears that before the patient fell out of his chair that his right arm raises up and his elbow is bent in a very stiff way.  A split second later his whole body appears to stiffen and bend to the left, then he falls out of the chair and is lying on the floor.  When on the floor, his legs appear to be fairly stiff as well.  This whole episode seems to last about 10 seconds or less.  The video makes it look more like a seizure than a case of syncope.

                                                A few minutes after patient received dose this morning around 9:20am, he became pale, developed hot flashes, shaking, nausea, dizziness, and hands feeling numb/tingling. Provided the patient with a cold pack for the back of his neck and water to drink, and encouraged him to sit with his head lowered. The patient&#39;s father pointed out that he had not had anything to eat that morning, which could have contributed to his response. After a few minutes, most of the symptoms abated, and patient was feeling much better. His father left the store with him at that time. Called the father later that day, and he said patient was feeling better. Had taken nap and was only feeling a little tired. I explained possible side effects from vaccine and father thanked me for our time and concern.

He was laid down on the ground, was given water and started to gain his consciousness slowly. He was palpitated, sweating, dehydrated, dizzy and nauseous. Blood pressure was checked 126/78, glucose 118. The reaction could be related to his diet as he has been fasting. He got better gradually when the medical team came. He was advise to keep hydrated and to eat. Patient was taken to the hospital for further check-up

And it has not stopped two weeks later. And I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m experiencing Brain fog however I do feel a bit slow in my mind not lethargic in my physical body.

Pharmacy staff came to his side and gave him wet, cold compresses and water.  He was feeling dizzy and clamy but never lost consciousness.  The pharmacist could see that the patient was wearing a CGM.  The patient was able to see his blood glucose levels on his receiver and they were high.  We were able to rule out hypoglycemia.  The patient threw up three times in the waste basket.  After about 20-30 minutes he started feeling better.

                                                17-year-old male who presents with 8 days of headache.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 4/21.  He felt like he had the flu after getting the vaccine and developed right-sided neck pain and a temperature to 100.  The patient did endorse being elbowed in the neck playing basketball during this time as well, as he played in a basketball tournament in right after this.  He got his Covid vaccine in his right deltoid.  He saw his pediatrician on 4/26 and a CT scan of his neck with IV contrast was done and this showed significant diffuse right-sided deep spatial neck edema and right-sided adenopathy.  The pediatrician discussed the findings with ENT who recommended augmentin and a medrol dosepak.  The patient developed a headache several days after this and went to urgent care for evaluation.  There was concern that the augmentin and steroids had caused the headache, so the steroids were stopped and he was switched to keflex on 4/30.  He was given phenergan and toradol at Urgent Care and discharged home.  His mom notes that several days ago he had fevers of 101-104.  He has not had a fever for several days now.  His headache continued and he felt unwell at basketball practice so he returned to urgent care on 5/4.  A CT scan of his head was done which showed right sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis as well as thrombophlebitis of the right IJ. He was sent to ED for further management at that time.  In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable and well-appearing.  The CTs were overread by our radiologists here.  The patient had some labs done at the outside urgent care but PT/PTT/INR and a CRP were drawn here, which were unremarkable.  A Covid PCR is negative.  Neurosurgery, neurology, and hematology were consulted.  Neurology recommended heparin and a hypercoagulable workup and hematology agreed with this plan.  The patient was admitted to the ICU for neuro checks and monitoring during initiation of heparin.

We took his blood pressure twice and his heart rate was 105 bpm..  Can not exactly remember blood pressure (seemed very off).  Took pt to the hospital where they measured his heart rate at 107 bpm.

Symptoms included body aches, runny nose and general malaise. However, over the last few days he has felt worse and developed more congestion, cough, and sweating. He did improve a little bit 2 days ago but then started to feel worse yesterday and had a worsening cough that is resulting in some chest tightness. Cough is productive sounding. Mom describes it as barking. No appreciable wheezing but he sounds hoarse. He has some SOB after coughing repeatedly. He states it simply feels like it is hard to breathe for 10-20minutes after a coughing attack but then it resolves. He developed sweating yesterday as well. He states he will just start sweating for no reason. No measured fever. No chills. Today he has dried skin and cracked lips from blowing/wiping his nose all the time. No fevers. No vomiting.

                                                Patient was the 4th person to receive today?s vaccine of Pfizer. This was his second dose. He did fine the first dose. Patient sat down in the chair and rolled sleeve up. Chose L deltoid for injection site. He was talking with a friend and writer gave injection. Placed band aid. Patient was quiet and looked like he was going to get up but fell forward out of the chair. He hit his L forehead on side of wall. Writer caught patient and sat him up on the ground. Eye?s were dilated, he was diaphoretic, zoned out and not responding initially to voice, but eyes were open. Eventually got patient up to a wheelchair and taken to office area to lay down and monitor. Father was notified and sat with us after he arrived at the school. Patient drank 1 full 120cc orange juice and approximately 6oz of water. Throughout monitoring patient gradually felt better. Pupils corrected to normal, wasn?t diaphoretic anymore, and vitals improved. He stated this has happened before with lab draws and shots, but not this severe. Writer and colleagues informed him to notify people that are going to give him shots or lab draws about his history. Also informed him to notify his teachers if he feels anything out the ordinary for the rest of the day. Make sure he hydrates. Patient then sat up and walked in the room. He stated he felt fine like before getting the shot. Patient left stable and under his own power.

                                                Intense headaches the day after taking the shot, back pain from the waist up. 2 days later I woke up with chest pain and the lingering headache, my chest feels heavy and maybe shortness of breath. I did a bunch of research however I did not find anything about chest pain related to the second dose of Pfizer. I am not sure if it is some type of tissue or muscle pain or something more serious. When I massage my chest it does not ache like the muscle pain from my shoulder so id assume it has to do with maybe my lungs or heart.

                                                came to see me 3 days after his first Pfizer Covid vaccine and had been having a subjective fever, bad headache and stomach ache since the day the vaccine was administered. He incidentally had some weight loss noted at the visit over the previous 6 months for which I did some lab work. The lab work was normal except for his platelet count which was 111,000. A repeat platelet count done a week later was normal at 273,000. Because of the transient decrease in platelet count and the 3 days of bad headache after the vaccine, I decided to hold off on  getting a second Covid vaccine. Additionally and possibly of no significance, his mother apparently had a history of ITP during her childhood.

                                                17-year old M with history of recurrent ear infections requiring PE tube placement who was in his usual state of health until 5/5 when he noticed a new itchy hive-like rash. He was short of breath 5/6, and developed fevers that night along with vomiting. He was seen 5/6 with negative COVID19 PCR and documented fever to 104. Fevers continued, and he was admitted the evening of 5/10 with concern for myocarditis. See below for hospital course. Additional information for Item 18: ...Screening labs were notable for mild lymphopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and elevated inflammatory markers.  Given prior COVID infection, rash, and systemic inflammation, additional studies including troponin, D-dimer, BNP, and EKG were obtained.  EKG was reassuringly normal, however the D-dimer (2.48), troponin (1.27), and BNP (469) were elevated.  Other work-up included chest x-ray which was unremarkable, and right upper quadrant ultrasound with incidental cavernous hemangioma of the liver.  He was started on milrinone (5/11-5/12) after initial TTE was concerning for severely diminished LV function. Follow-up TTE 12 hours later was normal (on milrinone), and remained so after milrinone was discontinued 5/12. Follow-up TTE after discontinuation remained normal. Cardiac MRI was completed 5/14, although read remains pending. He received IVIG on 5/11, and was started on methylpred 50 mg IV BID, Anakinra 100 mg SQ BID 5/14,  and transitioned to prednisone 30 mg PO BID with clinical improvement, down-trending troponin and systemic inflammatory labs.  Subsequent CBCs have been notable for rising leukocytosis (5/16 WBC 56.3) and thrombocytosis (5/16 plts 690) and 4&#43; spherocytes (with no known personal or prior history of spherocytosis). He will likely be discharged 5/17.   Infectious evaluation was unrevealing including cultures and viral studies. COVID spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were sent, but remain pending. Pt. initial COVID-19 infection was diagnosed October 2020, with positive saliva PCR testing.  He was symptomatic for 3-5 days.  He received his second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine 4/27 in his left arm; denies any significant reactions (arm swelling, injection site redness, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, fatigue, or fever). He has had passing contact with school classmates who have recently been diagnosed with COVID19.

Pt states he has had 1 day of sudden onset L shoulder pain and chest pain. Endorses dyspnea due to pain with deep breaths, denies tachypnea, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. Endorses mild chills and aches after COVID vaccine 3 days prior to onset of symptoms, denies any fever, URI symptoms, diarrhea, rash, known COVID contacts. Pain continued to worsen and spread across his chest, causing presentation to ED this afternoon. No history of PE, DVT, long travel, recent surgery, malignancy, alcohol or cocaine use. Significant cardiac history in family: dad with CAD w/LAD blockage, both parents with hypertension.    At ED, labs notable for elevated troponin 0.456, repeat 0.67 and diffuse ST elevations on EKG concerning for pericarditis. COVID neg, CXR unremarkable, blood cx drawn, no abx started. Patient was given toradol for pain with minimal improvement. Peds cardiology was consulted and patient was transferred to different ED for further care.   At different ED, repeat EKG showed similar diffuse ST elevations in I, II, aVL. Repeat troponins uptrending (4.91), proBNP 562, ESR 43, CRP 18. Mildly tachycardic but otherwise hemodynamically stable. Given tylenol for pain. Cardiology recommended admission for trending troponins, echo and cardiac monitoring.  CV: Troponins were trended every 12 hours with a max of 4.91.  His last troponin checked on the morning of discharge was 0.41.  He had an echo that showed normal cardiac function, an MRI that indicated normal ventricular size and function, with minimal or healing and inflammation or mild myocarditis.  During his admission, he had continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, that did not show any arrhythmias.   Resp: On 2L NC for comfort, no respiratory distress or hypoxia.   FENGI: Regular diet   Neuro: Ibuprofen scheduled and tylenol PRN for pain.  He was initially started on ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, but was starting to have pain prior to being due for medicine every 8 hours so his regimen was changed to 600 mg every 6 hours which controlled his pain adequately.   ID: Myocarditis panel sent with some results still pending.  Thus far, he is CMV negative, EBV IgG was positive but not IgM.  RVP was negative.  This all occurred in the setting receiving the Covid vaccine 3 days prior to presentation, which has been reported as a rare reaction to the Covid vaccine.  At the time of discharge, labs pending results include mycoplasma pneumonia, coxsackie, parvovirus, enterovirus. Etiology of myocarditis remains unclear at this time, could be related to infectious etiology not yet clear to us, vs related to his COVID vaccine prior to admission.

                                                Acute chest pain; Elevated troponin 16; This is spontaneous report received from a contactable Healthcare professional. A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly on 08Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0151) (at 17-year-old) as first dose, single in arm left for COVID-19 immunisation.

Medical history included ongoing hospitalization (Vaccine received during existing hospitalization). The patient&#39;s other concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Other medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination was reported as unknown. On 02May2021 04:00 AM, the patient experienced acute chest pain and elevated troponin 16, he was admitted to hospital.

Diaphragm movements when breathing increased severity of pain. Symptoms subsided within 12 hours with use of Kwan Loong Pain Relieving Oil. Unlike heartburn, nothing worked to relieve pain immediately. This was in addition to known side-effects that were present including: fatigue, slight fever, headache, muscle pain, and soreness at injection site.

Mom caught him and called for help and reported his eyeballs rolled up and he started down when she caught him. by time Pharmacist and store staff got there (less than a minute) he had regained consciousness but very lightheaded. No breathing difficulty. So got a chair and had him sit with head down and store staff observing. After another 10min he still reported lightheaded and nausea, so ambulance was called. When they arrived and checked him out everything checked out normal and he was feeling better so they released him to his parents care. Called on 5/24/21 at 10:10am and spoke to mom who reported he was doing fine and no apparent after effects.

The patient received his 2nd COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine on Thursday, 05/20/2021 in his left arm.  The patient developed a temperature of a 102.5° with aches, chill, and pain overnight.  The symptoms subsequently dissipated.  Around noon on 5/22 he began to experience an achiness and pressure beneath the sternum and it has been constant since.  The pain does not radiate into the back.  No associated ripping or tearing sensation.  No shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. In ED, EKG showed normal intervals, no ST changes and no STEMI. The patient underwent a CT angio of the chest and abdomen and did not show any dissection of the aorta.   The left and right proximal coronaries are visible, however their path could not be seen on the studies performed.  No pneumomediastinum both pneumothorax was observed. He had an elevated troponin of 3.1 and it increased to 7.3 prior to transfer to the ICU.  VS were stable with HR 80 - 90 and normal BP. Repeat ECG was normal but his troponin increased x 2 with maximum of 16. His CRP was mildly elevated and BPN upper limits of normal. Echo was normal.  Cardiologist consulted and pt diagnosed with myocarditis.  As of 5/24/21, patient remains hospitalized as troponin was 13.1 at 9:00 am.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine in the morning, then woke at about midnight. He went to get a drink of water, and was holding a glass of water in his hand. He started to feel as if the room was spinning, became very sweaty, had ringing in both ears, and lost consciousness, striking his head on the counter. The event was unwitnessed. He reports waking approximately 1 hour later with a bad headache. He had a headache and felt disoriented. He denies urinary/bowel incontinence or tongue biting. He was able to walk back to his room without difficulty, took ibuprofen, and went back to sleep. He woke the next morning with nausea and vomited, but this did not impact his headache. He has not had any notable neurologic symptoms since that time, but continues to have a minor headache. He has not had any further vomiting. Headache has not subsequently woken him from sleep and does not worsen with recumbent positioning. He denies visual changes, memory changes, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, ringing in his ears, or dizziness. He says his headache is located mostly around his forehead and at the top of his head that is now mild and feels like pressure ?like a tension type headache.? His mother is a nurse, and evaluated him the next day. The family did not feel that he needed to be seen in the emergency department, or prior to this visit. He has not had any previous episodes that were similar. Patient was evaluated in my clinic. Complete neurologic exam was within normal limits. He has been referred to neurology for further assessment.

                                                Patient received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 5/7/21. On 5/13/21 he began to feel feverish (unsure Tmax, never took temperature) and was intermittently febrile until hospital admission on 5/20/21. On 5/18/21 he was seen in the ED for fever and tested positive for strep throat and started on amoxicillin. His inflammatory labs were elevated at this time and did not notice improvement on amoxicillin. He returned to the ED on 5/20/21 at which time patient reported headaches on the right side, sharp 7/10 pain which come and go with the fevers as well as fatigue, muscle/body aches, and sweats in addition to persistent fever. He also noticed maculopapular rash on palms and soles and on distal extremities which was not pruritic or painful on day of hospital admission. All infectious workup was negative and patient did not improve on broad spectrum antibiotics. Given his persistent fever, hypotension, and inflammatory labs without other cause, patient was empirically treated for MIS-C and was given IVIG and methylprednisolone as well as being started on prophylactic dose enoxaparin for his elevated D-dimer. Repeat echocardiogram identified a new coronary aneurysm, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. Following IVIG and steroids patient remained afebrile and inflammatory markers down trended, however liver enzymes remained elevated at time of discharge. He improved and was discharged to finish steroid course at home with close follow up.

                                                Patient evaluated at local hospital for concern for meningitis / encephalitis, transferred to our facility and was able to get studies (detailed below some of which are still pending).   Initial symptoms presented with rhinorrhea, then severee headache, neck pain, and fever (tactile). Had sweats and chills. Began to experience diarrhea, dysuria, diffue body aches and myalgias. Severe pain in his neck / posterior occiput. Denied any mental status changes at the time.   Studies largely negative for an identifiable bacterial process so presumptive diagnosis is aseptic meningitis. Unclear if from vaccine or other etiologies. Outside hospital had started antibiotics but this was stopped and patient symptomatically recovered with only symptomatic care.

This physician reported similar events for two patients. This is the second of two reports. A 17-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 01May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single dose (at the age of 17-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included myocarditis from 2019 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient admitted to hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath, diagnosed with myocarditis on 05May2021. The patient was hospitalized for 6 days. Treatment received for the adverse events include metoprolol, amiodarone, ketorolac, IVIG. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 05May2021. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events were considered as serious (hospitalization).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Myocarditis is not uncommon disease in young population.  This 17-year-old male patient had medical history of myocarditis from 2019.  Based on information available, the reported recurrence of myocarditis with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath was not considered as causally related to the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

He said that he felt weird, tightness on his chest and he could not actually describe it, said it was in the middle of his chest.  It was uncomfortable but uncomfortable and was worried.  They observed him, the pain didn&#39;t go away, just on the chest.  If he tried to sit up he felt better, but when he laid down the pain was always there.  Around 3:00 PM she brought him to the ER and had tests run, and all tests were okay.  His EKG showed ST-elevations and inflammation of the heart.  He had an US of the heart and was discharged home this morning.  He has to be seen by his PCP to be referred to a cardiologist.  He was given some medications and is sleeping right now.  He has an APT with his PCP on 6/9/21.   He was sent home to take Ibuprofen.

Over a four minute period Patient slowly  began to regain color in his face. He knew where he was as well as the day of the week. 911 arrived and all of his vitals were good. The family declined going to the hospital because Patient felt much better.

                                                On Monday, May 31, 2021 at 1:20am pt. woke up with intense chest pain and labored breathing.  He was able to fall back to sleep and woke up two hours later (3am) with the pain escalating.  He did fall back to sleep again and once again woke up at 9am only to learn the pain was even worse and was barely able to breathe.  He called me, his mother, and I raced him home and straight to our local Emergency Room.  The ER originally thought it was a collapsed lung.  After the x-ray came back negative for a pneumothorax, they continued testing.  The very last test they did showed extremely elevated Troponin numbers at 1.05 and C-reactive Protein (CRP) numbers at 5.42.  We were transferred by EMS/ambulance to the hospital 40 minutes away and checked into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Pt was admitted in the afternoon of May 31st and was released on June 3rd at 1:30pm.  June 1st his Troponin was 0.26 and CRP was 6.10.  June 2nd Troponin was .45 and CRP was 3.54.  The day he was released from the PICU (June 3rd ), his Troponin was .45, and the CRP was down to  1.83.  Pt received daily EKGs, 24-hour heart monitoring, constant blood pressure tests, as well as blood oxygen levels.  Once released from the hospital, Pt will be on light duty for at least a week, if not more.  First follow-up Cardiologist appointment was June 8th at 10:30am.  Echocardiogram, EKG, and blood work was ?normal.? Pt was put on a 72 hour heart monitor on June 8th and will be removed June 11th.  Will start weaning off Ibuprofen and acid reducer, Pantoprazole, the next three weeks.

A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 21May2021 (Lot Number: EW0618) (at the age of 17 years old) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No reported family medical history relevant to adverse events (AE), no reported cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction (MI) under 50, no early deaths, nor any pertinent history. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0619) on Apr2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced myocardial injury on 23May2021, 2 days after he received his second Covid vaccine with possible association. It was stated that the patient came in to the emergency room (ER) about 28 hours after his second vaccine with sudden chest pain that woke him up and got worse. Further stated that the patient was seen at an outside emergency department (ED) and had elevated troponins, creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK MB), electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST segment elevation, Echo showed trivial effusion, normal coronaries, and low to normal function. It was reported that he was admitted for monitoring due to potentially decompensating. Stated that he was consulted because of the association with the vaccine, and viral testing was done; the patient was tested for enterovirus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), epstein-barr virus (EBV), and parvovirus, all were negative. Treatment received was intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), pain medication and general support. States that the patient did receive IVIG while he was there, a one time dose, because the cardiologist was concerned with the way his troponins were trending, no decompensation. Further stated that the patient did not receive any pressors at any point and that the patient was still in the hospital but he was being transferred to the floor and they were trending labs, but he was not on any pressors or anything and he seemed like he has been doing well. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Chest pain and myocardial injury required a visit to Emergency Room on 23May2021. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No or unknown AE following prior vaccinations. As per the reporter all events seriousness criteria reported as medically significant, hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized from 24May2021 and ongoing at the time of the report (also reported as 2 days and counting). The outcome of all the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based solely on chronological connection to the vaccine causality between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm, at age 17 years, on 12Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pressure in his eye from an injury, asthma (diagnosed when the patient was about 2) and has family members with asthma and heart conditions. Patient is in perfect health, he works out 6 days a week, and does football conditioning 5 days a week. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Concomitant medication included timolol taken for pressure in his eye from an injury from an unspecified start date to 20May2021. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. The patient historically received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number: EP7534) at the left arm at age 17 years on 22Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient got his second dose of the vaccine on 12Apr2021 and shorty after on 19Apr2021, he became very fatigued, very weak, his chest hurt, and he had shortness of breath. On Apr2021, patient had dizziness. The patient used to have bulky arms and now you can see his muscle mass depleting in Apr2021. The patient cannot focus on school online because of the headaches from 19Apr2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure goes up and down from 19Apr2021. For days from 19Apr2021, the patient&#39;s heart rate will be fine in the 60s and it goes up to 120 or 130 with chest pain, it fluctuates depending on the day.  The patient visited the emergency room on 05May2021, but was not admitted and no one knows what was going on with the vaccine. It was also reported that the patient lost 14 pounds on 25Apr2021 since the second dose of the vaccine. They knew the patient has already lost 10 pounds and then yesterday, 25May2021, the patient weighed himself and noticed he has lost another 4 pounds over the weekend. Patient had bloodwork on 20May2021 and it was all negative. The primary care provider was concerned about the weight loss so she ran a bunch of blood work. The patient is negative for COVID test and chest x-ray on 21May2021 and he has had multiple tests done. The patient went to his primary care provider on 25May2021 (yesterday from the time off reporting) and the reporter mentioned that maybe can they look at this as being a side effect from the vaccine. The patient&#39;s doctor laughed and said nothing has been proven yet about this. The reporter felt that this is a reaction to the vaccine. At the time of reporting on 26May2021, the patient was not able to function and sleeps all day. The patient also underwent lab tests and procedures that includes being tested negative for mono twice now (on unspecified dates). Clarified that they have not filed a safety report with Pfizer on the patient&#39;s events. The outcome of the events &#39;dizziness&#39;, &#39;lost 14 pounds since the second dose of the vaccine/lost another 4 pounds over the weekend&#39;, &#39;muscle mass depleting&#39;, &#39;cannot focus on school online&#39;, &#39;not able to function&#39; and &#39;sleeps all day&#39; was unknown; while for the other events, it was not recovered.

I took his vital signs with a pulse oximeter and his saturation was in the high 90&#39;s and his pulse was normal in the 80&#39;s range. He pointed to his chest and he said it hurt him and for about three hours he appeared to experience moderate to severe pain. I called the pediatrician who said these symptoms were not uncommon. I can&#39;t remember if I gave my son tylenol or advil to help alleviate symptoms. His symptoms appeared to resolve within 3-5 hours. Also, he had felt feverish and sluggish after the administration of the vaccine for the three days leading up to the symptoms of chest pain.

At further inspection I noticed that he was having a rash . I had a sit for a few more minutes then his mom came up and we noticed that his arm started to swell. We gave him 2 capsules Benadryl 25mg and instructed him to go to urgent care. Called for a follow up later in the evening and found that urgent care send him to the ER. The rash was spread all over and well as the swelling. He swelled all the way to his toes. He also tuned white and became very lightheaded at the ER. They gave him IV Benadryl and dexamethasone and was sent home. It has been recommended by the ER doctors to not get the 2nd dose.

                                                This is a 18 y.o. male who is generally healthy. He received a second dose of the SARS2-COV vaccine on 3/4. The following morning he felt feverish and achy with malaise. He stayed home, drank fluids and rested and felt well enough to come up to ski this weekend. During skiing he had some anterior chest pain, it resolved and he went about his day. Tonight at 2245 the pain became sharp and awakened him from sleep. He felt nauseated and clammy as well. Father brought him to the ER for evaluation. His emergency department evaluation showed ST elevations most notably in the inferior and lateral leads as well as in the lateral precordium.

Noted the following day this his eyes looked yellow, more that usual, and came to the clinic on 3/1/21 for evaluation.  was feeling better but due to acute jaundice had blood work that indicated markedly elevated bilirubin and low platelets.  Further testing for hepatitis was negative.  Was sent to the ER the following day as we were unable to get blood drawn and GI consult was desired.  There he had a normal abdominal US and bilirubin had dropped and he has since been followed by GI and is currently being evaluated by Hematology for any underlying conditions that may be contributing.

The chest started when the patient went to bed the evening of March 27, where he began having substernal non-radiating chest pain with inspiration. The pain was relieved by sitting upright and by taking some acetaminophen. He received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on March 25 (first dose was March 5). He was initially treated with ketorolac 15mg IV and given 1 liter of lactated ringer&#39;s solution via IV.  His chest pain resolved after this. He was eventually given colchicine 0.6mg twice daily and ibuprofen 600mg 3 times daily due to concern for myopericarditis. He was ultimately found to have no evidence of pericarditis after undergoing a cardiac MRI, thus colchicine and ibuprofen were discontinued. Due to findings of mildly reduced ejection fraction on imaging, he was started on metoprolol XL 25mg once daily at discharge.

                                                My healthy 18-year old son had his first dose of Pfizer, and within a few minutes he felt dizzy. His heart rate was also rapid. He didn&#39;t think much of it, but the dizziness persisted and so they had him lay down with feet up. After about 20 minutes, he began to vigorously shake (rigors I believe is what it is called.) He felt numb in both arms and also his tongue and mouth. We had 3 nurses attending to him, and after about 30 minutes they decided to send him to the ER for evaluation since the very strong shaking and other symptoms were worsening. The shaking, dizziness, numbness all subsided after about an hour. He was given a Zyrtec upon first symptoms about 15 minutes after dose. The ER doc doesn&#39;t believe it was an allergic reaction but potentially a strong vasovagal response and immune response. He felt tired after but was completely fine 2 hours later. We were discharged from the ER a few hours later after evaluation. Vitals were in normal range including blood sugar, blood pressure and oxygen. He was fully hydrated prior and had a turkey sandwich and orange prior to coming so was not low on food either. The shaking was very extreme and concerning. It has been almost 24 hours and he is feeling fine other than a sore arm.

EMS checked the patient and cleared him approximately 20-25 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

She stated patient looked gray and said his oxygen saturation was 78%. His blood pressure was 88/60. She poured cold water on his chest, thinking he could be overheated. She instructed another nurse to call 911.  A call went out over the walkie-talkie for a Charge Nurse to come to the scene at 1440. At this time the other nurse was already on the phone with EMS. When I arrived to patient around 1441, patient&#39;s oxygen saturation was 99% and pulse was 80. He was pale. He was talking coherently. He stated he had not eaten all day. I gave him some hard candy to suck on.  Around 1445, EMS arrived. They assessed him and determined he did not need additional care.  He signed EMS forms and the patient&#39;s brother drove him home. Patient was advised to make sure he did not go a whole day without eating before getting his second dose of the vaccine.

I took his BP and it was 126/75 and his pulse was 73. He drank a bottle of water and 15 minutes later, felt fine. I instructed him to follow up with his physician because he stated that this has happened before (not after a vaccine though).  Patient said he did just finish a tennis match and may be dehydrated.

Since then he has been to the Emergency Room 6-7 times for chest pain - workup is consistently negative He has seen two Cardiologists, a Neurologist and has had further workup.  It should be said that I feel it is probably not vaccine related and is likely anxiety related - however patient insists that it is related to the vaccine - he has never felt like this before.

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm at the age of 18-year-old on 07Apr2021 09:50 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing congenital diaphragmatic hernia (that prevented his lungs from developing before he was born). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (FLU) for immunization and without a reaction. Caller is a consumer, calling about his 18 years son who received the covid vaccine this morning and had an adverse event afterwards. Caller reported that his 18 years son had his first covid vaccine dose this morning. He has had all of his vaccinations, even the flu shot every year without a reaction. After having his covid vaccination, on the way home he said he started feeling light headed. He was supposed to go back to school once they got home but the caller noticed that his son hadn&#39;t left yet because he drives himself. He reported that his son&#39;s room is downstairs and when he looked his son was laying down at the bottom of the stairs and appears to have passed out. He reports that now he is fine and he has eaten. Calling now because he was concerned and &#34;wanted to make sure there was nothing else I should do in this situation&#39;&#39;. Caller stated that he took his two kids to get their vaccines. His son is 18 years old and his daughter will be 18 next Tuesday.Stated that they stayed at the site in case of a reaction to the vaccine and nothing happened. On the way back home the son became lightheaded. Caller thought maybe he needed to eat even though he had eaten a light breakfast before they went to get the vaccines. Stated his son got home and passed out. Caller had never seen his son pass out before. Said his son fell down the stairs while going to the basement where is room is located. Caller was concerned this could&#39;ve been a reaction and is calling to see if there is anything further they should be concerned about.

                                                Recipient received dose #2 vaccine today, and almost immediately had response with witnessed seizure-like activity, with posturing, tonic-clonic movement of his upper extremities, and eye movement with lateral nystagmus. Loss of consciousness was noted. Symptoms lasted approximately 15-30 seconds, and patient was placed in a reclined position. He regained consciousness quickly and became pale and diaphoretic. He was normally responsive and answered questions appropriately. Initial BP 74/32, HR 38, SpO2 98%. He drank some Gatorade and had improvement of symptoms gradually over 15-20 minutes. Repeat BP 100/58, HR 78. No past history of seizures. One prior syncopal event after pain response with sports injury. No prior difficulty with dose #1. After recovery, patient reported immediate pain with vaccine administration, then vision went blurry and he lost consciousness. Mother was driving the vehicle, and she witness symptoms as well as nursing staff in the vaccine pod. After recovery, options for further medical evaluation were discussed given complicated vasovagal response with seizure-like activity, mother called pediatrician to see if he could be seen, they recommended ER. Mother chose to drive by personal vehicle, rather than EMS transport. Symptoms were fully resolved and patient was transported to ER for further evaluation by personal vehicle.

SpO2 was 79% initially during this episode, but quickly bounced back up to 100% when he regained consciousness. EMS called due to possible airway involvement.  EMS arrived,, VS WNL at that time, however patient BP did not increase with postural changes (pt showed postural hypotension), so EMS transported him to local ED.  On 4/27/2021, I spoke with patient family to check in and patient mother reports that ED doc told her he was likely dehydrated and had a &#34;severe syncopal&#34; episode. Reports no adverse effects or expected effects from the vaccine and will likely return for his second dose. For second dose, our staff will ensure he is lying down supine for  vaccine administration.

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient experienced a syncopal episode. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient reported taking a marijuana edible prior to vaccination and stated he was anxious about the vaccine. The patient was normotensive (121/68). EMS administered 0.5L normal saline and 4mg IV Zofran. EMS transported the patient to Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient reported taking a marijuana edible at 1200 and that after their vaccination they experienced feeling flushed, nausea, vomiting, and near-syncope. After several hours waiting in the ED, the patient noted feeling improvement. The patient&#39;s labs and tests were unremarkable. Patient was discharged with vasovagal reaction and cannabis abuse.

An 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number and expiration date were not reported) on the left arm on 12Apr2021 (11:30) as a single dose, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included peanut and penicillin allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On12Apr2021 (11:45), the patient had loss of consciousness; seizure; drowsiness/could not stay awake; and vomiting. The events had resulted in an emergency room/department for urgent care, and were assessed as serious (medically significant). The patient was hospitalized in Apr2021 due to loss of consciousness. The patient had received epinephrine (EPIPEN) as treatment for the reported events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Apr2021. The patient did no have COVID-19 prior to the vaccination, and had not been tested post-vaccination.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He went to stand up and then blacked out, falling to the floor. He did not injure himself or experience any trauma in the fall. He did not lose consciousness. I believe he was experiencing increased anxiety from the event as the patient mentioned several times that he did not like needles/injections. The patient remained sitting upright for an additional 15 minutes, drinking water, and his mother escorted him out of the store and drove him home.

The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies to nickel and dust mites. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient developed severe chest pain between the night of 16Apr2021 to 17Apr2021, and was admitted to the hospital on 17Apr2021, diagnosed with peri/myocarditis. The cardiology team was convinced it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. He remains hospitalized (number of days of hospitalization was also reported as 2). The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, and hospitalization. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination which was a nasal swab with negative result on 17Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of peri/myocarditis which included ibuprofen, aspirin, and colchicine. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

He initially had chest pain the day prior to admission with pain in his back and down his left arm. This improved with Tylenol and resolved prior to bed. On the morning of 5/6 the chest pain returned and was so severe it woke him from sleep. He was difficult for him to characterize, but he said it was all over his chest, sometimes sharp and pressure-like, most severe in mid substernal region and was so substantial that he had difficulty speaking properly. He feels that the pain is most severe when lying flat and is best managed when he is resting at a 45 degree angle. Patient was at ED he was found to have an initial ECG with ST depressions in aVR and elevations in II, aVF, and V2 through V6 raising suspicion for pericarditis/myocarditis. Initial troponin was elevated at 4.35 as well. Cardiology Dr. was contacted by ED physician, case discussed, and EKGs reviewed and felt this was more likely pericarditis, but not STEMI. Of note, he reports a family history significant for his mother having a?hole in her heart.?He was given Toradol with improvement in his pain and upon arrival to hospital his chest pain was markedly improved.  He was noted to have troponins peaking at 39.415 that down trended and an elevated CRP of 4.8 on admission. D-dimer was 0.26. Covid PCR was negative.  He was evaluated by cardiology again here who upon review of his ECG and cardiac enzymes as well as presentation was consistent with pericarditis. Echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function with trace posterior pericardial effusion and telemetry was monitored without any arrhythmias. He was started on low-dose beta-blockers, aspirin 650 mg 3 times a day, and colchicine 0.6 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses followed by 0.6 mg daily. He is planned to continue this for approximately 3 months and will need to follow-up with cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks for repeat monitoring and management with plan to taper off aspirin once his CRP normalizes.  Later that night, he even had a similar episode of sudden onset chest pain for which she received IV Toradol with minimal relief and oral Tylenol with relief of symptoms after that. No telemetry abnormalities were recorded at that time.   ECG the following day showed improving ST changes and troponin of 26.328 with CRP 4.2. He had no further symptoms for over 24 hours and is responding well to treatment.   He is advised to take Tylenol as needed in addition to the above-mentioned medicines should he have any recurrent chest pain.

                                                Patient (DOB 05-01-2003) received his 1st COVID vaccine (Pfizer, lot # EW0182 use by 5/15/21 at 0855) at 1539. The patient became pale approximately 30 seconds following the administration of the vaccine, EMT assisted the patient to the chair as he was standing up when he became pale, the patient loss consciousness for approximately 2 seconds. RN arrived at the station and assisted the patient to the ground, where he was placed in a supine position with his lower extremities elevated. The patients face mask was removed, he was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The patients color slowly returned to his face. Vitals were taken at 1540: BP: 155/70 (R arm, supine position), HR 70, RR 16, oxygen saturation at 97%, and pupils were equal. The patient had a history of fainting x 1 and his last meal was at 0800 and he stated, &#34; I didn&#39;t drink that much today.&#34; Denied any chronic medical conditions, was not currently taking any medications, and denied any drug allergies. The patient was moved to the anti-gravity chair and he was given pringles and Gatorade. Vitals were retaken at 1545: BP 162/80 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 50, RR 16, oxygen saturation at 97%. Denied any dizziness, headache, chest pain, or vision changes.  Vitals were retaken at 1553: BP 158/72 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 52, RR 16, Oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient was advised to eat a full meal prior to receiving his second COVID vaccine dose and to receive his 2nd dose in the anti-gravity chair. Vitals were retaken at 1558, BP 152/78 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 57, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient was also given a bottle of water, as he did not consume many liquids during the day. The patient&#39;s color fully returned to his face and he denied any shortness of breath, dizziness, changes in vision, or difficulty swallowing. Vitals retaken at 1603, BP 150/75 ( R arm, sitting upright), HR 60, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient called his mother to pick him up, as we strongly advised him to not operate machinery/ a vehicle after fainting. The patient&#39;s vital signs were taken at 1608, BP 140/75, HR 60, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient was advised to drink the entire bottle of water, as his blood pressure was slightly elevated and it was most likely due to being dehydrated, as he did not consume any fluid since 0800 earlier that day. The patient drank a bottle of water and his vital signs were retaken at 1614, BP 122/68 (R arm, sitting upright) and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. The patient&#39;s mother arrived on site around 1630 and spoke with RN and both EMT. RN instructed the patient about emergency precautions and to follow up with his primary care provider. RN also educated the patient about the importance of informing the healthcare provider about his history of fainting with the first vaccine, when receiving the second COVID Pfizer vaccine. Gave the patient V-safe information and reported the occurrence in VAERS. The patient had a steady and even gait when leaving the site with his mother at 1632.

An 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EW0169) at single dose, on 22Apr2021 at 17:30, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. Patient&#39;s mother reported that her son fainted within 30 seconds of receiving the Pfizer vaccine 1st dose and since then he had experienced some intermittent light headedness and dizziness. He passed out completely after shot. Adverse events were described as following: &#34;patient is due to get his second dose of the shot later this evening but is having periods of lightheadedness and dizziness. Patient&#39;s mother states that her son also feels like he is going to pass out. She states that this started 30 seconds after the first shot. Her son only passed out once, completely right after the shot, it was a bad experience. She&#39;s glad he actually wants the other one today, but he is concerned because he is still lightheaded and dizzy after 3 weeks. Patient&#39;s mother states that he has been trying to function, work, and live his life but its irritating to him and scary. The doctor suggested that he should get his second dose but her son is a little fearful&#34;. Physician Office Visit required. The patient did not recover from intermittent light headedness and dizziness, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile and strong temporal relationship there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the reported events and the suspect drug.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

He and his mother went to the restroom where she helped him to the floor so he did not fall. He reports not remembering walking to the bathroom, and was woozy when I (the pharmacist) arrived to the restroom. His breathing was elevated, and he was pale in color. No emergency medication was administered . Paramedics arrived to check him out, and he left the store under his own power.   The vaccine-administering technician reported that he seemed very nervous to receive the vaccine today. When I was talking to him in the restroom he admitted that he has a history of anxiety/panic attacks when receiving vaccines in the past.

He had generalized muscle aches and mild flu-like symptoms which were not unexpected on Monday the 17th.  On the 18th, he reported dyspnea on exertion, some chest tightness, and his throat felt like it was &#34;closing&#34;.  He also had tender anterior cervical lymph nodes and a fever to 100.8 °F.  He came into the ER for further evaluation. After evaluated by cardiology, given his stability, felt appropriate for discharge with immediate outpatient follow-up.

                                                Patient received vaccine around 5 pm. For the first two minutes after vaccination the patient seemed to be fine. Starting around that 3rd minute the patient got very dizzy and nauseous. He was then seated to prevent further NV. I asked the patient if they were breathing ok and the patient stated his breathing was fine. After about another minute the patient&#39;s eyes got glossy and the patient seemed to be out of it. I asked multiple orienting questions such as his name, where he was, and what day of the week it is. He was only able to answer the day of the week and his head was bobbing. I then called 911 as the patient became very pale and started to profusely sweat. While on the phone with the 911 operator, the patient went completely unconscious and lost control of motor functions. I was able to confirm the patient was still breathing and still had a heart rate (although rapid) and thus compressions were not given. The EMT arrived quickly to the scene and took over care of the patient. After about 20 minutes of checking vital signs, the EMT gave the patient and his family the option on whether they want to go to the hospital or not for further examination. The family decided they wanted to take the ambulance to the hospital.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient passed out and his eyes rolled back (possible seizure activity). This activity lasted for approximately 1 minute.  Patient also felt dizzy, sweaty,  nauseous, and became pale. Patient was given a cold ice pack to lower his body temperature. Patient was also given crackers for nausea, and a bag just incase he had to vomit. Patient&#39;s mother was also here to tend to the patient. The mother also gave him clear fluids (sprite) to help with the nausea.  After approximately 10 minutes, the patient was able to stand without feeling dizzy. He left the store with his mother to be watched closely (His mother is a nurse.) They also refused emergency medical services.

                                                myopericarditis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician. An 18-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) as an intramuscular single dose in left arm on 10May2021 14:30 (lot number unknown) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received his first injection as an intramuscular single dose in left arm on 16Apr2021 02:45 pm (lot number unknown) at age of 18-year-old for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and morbid obesity (BMI 47). Patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA). The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient developed chest pain and was admitted to the hospital with myopericarditis. The event started at 03:00 am on 13May2021. He had elevated troponin and an abnormal EKG. He improved with NSAIDS and Colchicine. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days and recovered from the event on an unspecified date. The patient had no Covid prior vaccination and had real time PCR via nasal swab on 13May2021 with negative result.   Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported event myopericarditis along with its symptoms and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. However, the  patients state of morbid obesity and asthma maybe considered risk factors. The limited information available precludes further assessment.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Authorities, Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                pericarditis; a large pericardial effusion; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. An 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown), at the age of 18 years old, at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter explained the only probable trigger to the 18-year-old male patient developing pericarditis and a large pericardial effusion was the receipt of the first dose of BNT162B2, 2-3 weeks before the diagnosis. The reporter added he read through the CDC website, about increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis after getting the second dose of BNT162B2. The reporter asked if the second dose was contraindicated after such adverse reaction to the first dose. The outcome of events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events of Pericarditis and Pericardial Effusion and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

I began to have random chest/heart pressure when breathing out/ swallowing food or drinks. I began to rest and took ibuprofen (Motrin) to relive my side effects. I soon began to feel more or less the same symptoms  on the 26th and 27th of May. On the 28th I woke up to the sides of my stomach hurting, but went away once I ate breakfast. Days go by and I felt my symptoms going down. Around May 30th to June 1st, sometime in between I felt that my symptoms had been relived, As of June 6th, the day I am reporting this event I have not felt what I felt during those days.

He was having &#34;shaky&#34; movements, unresponsive, diaphoretic and very pale.  Also noticed he was hitting head twice on wall.  After protecting his head, he regained consciousness in approx. 15 sec.  Staff had been called and 911 was activated.  My oximeter read pulse of 40 to 45 and saturation between 96 to 98%.  Pt. claimed it wasn&#39;t his first time after &#34;needles&#34; passing out.  Said he had a good breakfast and lunch.  He declined having his parents called.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

                                                Pfizer shot given.  Patient felt ok immediately after shot, but approximately 5 minutes later told his mom he felt weird.  He passed out and was helped to a sitting position.  When I was called out to the lobby patient was still feeling a little lightheaded but he was conscious and breathing normally.  He sustained a small cut on his hand which we cleaned up promptly.  Patient told mom he felt like his vision was  blurry.  Mom wanted him checked out so I called emergency help.

He regained consciousness right away and didn&#39;t remember passing out.  I asked him to recline and elevate his legs and he held that position for several minutes and then seemed fine after that.  He said he has an extreme fear of needles and felt he passed out from the anxiety he was feeling prior to getting the shot.  He remained in the post-vaccine waiting area for an additional 15-20 minutes and did not have another episode of syncope.

The mom, accompanying the patient, started helping him off the floor and as I was helping her, the patient immediately woke up and regained consciousness, but was a little pale. I brought water for the patient, took his blood pressure which was about 100/50. His mom brought him orange juice and as I was sitting with the patient, he stated that he usually faints when getting blood drawn and such. I sat with the patient for about 10-15 minutes, and  he was improving, regaining color and more talkative. I then had the patient slowly get up and had his blood pressure measured again and it was 105/75 which according to himself and his mom was his normal. They then decided to leave and the patient was doing well by then.

On the day prior to arrival he developed increasing shortness of breath particularly with talking and with ambulation.  He also describes chest tightness with deep inspiration, the tightness radiates to back, no radiation to left arm or jaw.  Chest tightness is non-positional, but does feel worse immediately after he lies down from ambulation and then slowly dissipates.  His last subjective fever was yesterday evening.  He has never had a reaction to the vaccine before.  He has no allergies.  No prior medical conditions he is aware of, and takes no medications.  He did not experience any of the symptoms following the first vaccine. He has h/o asymptomatic COVID infection in November 2020. Cardiology consulted for concern of pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccine. He does not have significant ST elevation or PR depression.  He also does not have evidence of significant pericardial effusion at this point.  The high sensitivity troponins are mildly elevated.  He does have viral syndrome.  Is unclear if Covid vaccination was causally related to his symptoms.  We would like to improve his medications for better chest pain control and to prevent recurrent pericarditis in the future.

Sat down he started to sweat profusely. Told him to take his sweatshirt off. Continues to sweat his forehead his T-shirt was wet his back was wet. Then he tilted his head back his eyes rolled back into his head. I called the nurse. We got him to a wheelchair and behind the curtain. Before we had a chance to put him on the Exam Table he passed out and started to seize for the count of 3 or 4 seconds. Then he woke up. He said he saw white beautiful light. I am not kidding. He does not joke. Then he said he was fine. Insisted he was fine.  His bp was low for the first two readings. Then It came back up to normal. He laid flat for 15 more min. Had some juice. Sat up when It was gone to go. Bp got super high. We waited till It was normal and left.

                                                heart failure; heart attack; fluid in his lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 19-year-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 25Mar2021 (received at the age of 19-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing seasonal allergies and cardiac murmur he had as an infant. When probing medical history, the consumer reported that as an infant, her son, had a heart murmur. Her son saw a heart specialist in (State) who did an ultrasound/sonogram of her son&#39;s heart. The specialist said the heart murmur was fine and nothing needed to be done. She also adds that for family medical history, she and her husband don&#39;t have any early onset heart issues in either side of their families. She also reported that her son has horrible seasonal allergies. Concomitant medication(s) included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; triamcinolone acetonide (NASACORT) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; montelukast (MONTELUKAST) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The reporter stated that her son (patient) had a heart attack (26Mar2021) after receiving the first dose of bnt162b2. The patient also experienced heart failure on 28Mar2021 and had fluid in his lungs on Mar2021. She called regarding the COVID-19 vaccine on behalf of her 19-year-old son who received his first vaccine on 25Mar2021. Her son received his first Covid 19 vaccine at a PRIVACY where he attends college. On Friday, 26Mar2021, he was feeling crummy, on Saturday, 27Mar2021, he was feeling crummy. On Saturday night, 27Mar2021, her son started texting her around 11:30PM saying he had pain in his left shoulder and left arm. He had already taken 2 Advil and it wasn&#39;t helping with the pain, her son asked if he could take a third Advil. The reporter told her son he could take a third Advil because it had been an hour and a half since he had taken the first two Advil. The texts from her son continued. He was getting no relief. He took a hot shower and tried self-massage and warm compresses. He ended up throwing up and he said he felt a little better. Her son tried to lay down and couldn&#39;t get any relief from his pain. The pain was tremendous in his left shoulder and arm. Her son told his mother, he thinks he needs to go to the emergency department. His mother is two hours away from him and told him to call 911. Her son had a friend take him to the emergency department instead of calling 911. Her son went to PRIVACY. While at the emergency department, the doctor thought that her son&#39;s pain was muscular. Her son received an injection of Toradol. Her son was discharged from the emergency room and went back out to his friend who had brought him to the hospital. Her son and his friend didn&#39;t even make it out of the emergency department parking lot when her son suddenly couldn&#39;t see anything. His eyes were wide open and all he could see was black. His ears started ringing. Her son went back into the emergency department. Her son received Benadryl and an Epi-pen thinking maybe he was allergic to the Toradol and having a reaction to the Toradol. Her son had blood work, an EKG, and vital signs done in the emergency department on 28Mar2021. His blood work were over 3000 which the reporter reports, indicates a heart attack. The emergency room doctor did not think the Toradol would have pushed his Troponin levels that high. With her son complaining to her about the pain in his left shoulder radiating into his left arm and throwing up, those are signs of a heart attack. Her son was maybe playing off the seriousness of the pain he was experiencing. It was agreed at that point it might be her son&#39;s heart. She was about 18 minutes away from the hospital when she received a call from the hospitalist, the doctor taking care of her son. And that doctor tells her that her son is not doing well and is not responding to treatment of the bag of saline fluids. The doctor is trying to get her son&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate back up. The doctor was afraid he might have to air flight him to the PRIVACY hospital. She told the doctor she is 18 minutes away and asked if he can wait that long or does she have to turn around and drive the opposite direction to the PRIVACY. At this point her son was having a COVID-19 viral test in case he needs to be transported to the other hospital. The doctor tells her that her son can wait the 18 minutes until she gets to the hospital. She arrived at the hospital and wanted to see her son, her son is on high flow oxygen and she has to gown and glove up to be in his room for fear of Covid particles since he&#39;s on the high flow oxygen. His COVID-19 viral test results have not come back at this time. Her son was admitted to the hospital for heart failure. He was in the hospital for 5 days. He was admitted in the wee hours of the morning on 28Mar2021. During the time he was in the hospital he had chest x-rays and he was given Lasix to get the fluid off his lungs. His white blood cells were way up so he was given an antibiotic. He had an MRI, Chest X-rays, and a Heart Catheterization through his wrist that would indicate that he had blocked arteries in his heart. He had no blocked arteries. The heart catheterization revealed an artery going into his 4th heart chamber was slow to open and close. The cardiologist prescribed Metoprolol for six months with monitoring. The cardiologist feels the Metoprolol will repair his artery and get his blood pressure and heart rate numbers where they need to be. He was admitted to the hospital at around 3:00AM on 28Mar2021 and was discharged on 01Apr2021. Her son&#39;s COVID-19 viral test came back negative, but his COVID-19 antibody test showed that he did have COVID-19 antibodies. The doctor didn&#39;t know if that meant that her son had a previously undiagnosed case of the COVID-19 virus or if he developed COVID-19 antibodies that soon after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. She reported when her son was discharged, he was feeling better, but still had residual fluid at the bottom of his lungs. Her son did have to go for a chest x-ray on Tuesday, 06Apr2021, after he was discharged, to make sure the fluid was making its way out of his body. When he was discharged from the hospital, he had some shortness of breath and he was tired and weak feeling. The pain in his left arm began before he was admitted to the hospital. The shortness of breath started during his hospital admission. At this point in time she would say her son has improved. The Metoprolol he was prescribed by the cardiologist is one half of a 25mg tablet once at nighttime. She stated that she does not have any information on how low her son&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate were during his time in the hospital. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the adverse events. Outcome of the events was recovering.

Same symptoms returned (chills, low fever, heavy sweating, tense breathing) approx. 60 hours later along with severe aching chest pain. All symptoms resolved by next morning besides chest pain, which was severe enough to warrant emergency room admission about 72 hours after vaccination. Admitted to hospital overnight with an episode of palpitations around 6pm on the first night, being given motrin and colchicine throughout stay. Pain somewhat resolved and was discharged aprox. 100 hours after vaccination. Continued use of ibuprofen and colchicine in weeks following as pain slowly resolves.

                                                My son is rarely sick. He came home from college, just after a few weeks from receiving the vaccine with a terrible cough and an unusual nosebleed. Every time he blows his nose, it is bloody. Never in 19 years have I observed this. My son is a college athlete and is extremely strong and healthy. These symptoms do not seem to be going away. The bloody nose is the most unusual effect and we are concerned this is an inflammatory side effect.

The following day developed substernal chest pain radiating to neck and left shoulder and arm.   Also reports fever of 101 degrees on 5/10/2021.  Used Tylenol, initially with some reloief, but symptoms worsened over the course of the next few days.  Then presented to ER on 5/13/21 because of worsening pain.    EKG showed diffuse ST elevations c/w pericarditis.  Initial Troponin 11.1, ultimately peaking at 13.67, c/w myopericarditis.   Admitted to hospital for supportive care, and treated with PO colchicine.   A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal LV function without segmental wall motion abnormality and no pericardial effusion.  A Cardiac CT showed normal coronary arteries.     The patient&#39;s symptoms improved with colchicine.   He was discharged home with a course of colchicine on 5/15/21.   A subsequent outpatient Cardiac MRI did show epicardial and mid wall late gadolinium enhancement involving the basal to mid lateral and inferolateral walls, and a mid wall stripe of distal anteroseptal, septal and inferoseptal segments, c/w myocarditis, idiopathic cardiomyopathy or sarcoidosis.  The pericardium was borderline thickened at 3 mm.

Patient stated that he had 2nd COVID vaccine on 4/29. He was noted to have one episode of vomiting and developed coughing. He has been c/o of sharp chest pain for the past two days. He was noted to have arm pain. He had chest pain when he breaths. He took advil and noted to have slight improvement in his pain.  He was noted to have an elevated troponin and CK. Cardiology was consulted. His initial troponin came back 4.49 with a CPK of 294.   Serial troponins were obtained. Troponin peaked to 44.8 and CPK to 1345, Echo showed newly reduced LVEF of 55%.   Diagnosed with myopericarditis possibly related to the Covid vaccine and pt was transferred to the Hospital for cardiac MRI and further work-up. Upon transfer to the hospital, cardiac MRI was performed and showed acute myocarditis with no evidence of pericardial thickening or pericarditis. It also showed left ventricular function was at the lower limits of normal with a calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and no focal wall motion abnormality. He was treated with colchicine 0.6mg, pepcid 20 mg, and ibuprofen 600mg for the myocarditis and oral morphine 15mg and tylenol 1,000mg for chest pain. He was counseled on avoiding strenuous activity for the next 3 months and following up with cardiology upon discharge.

NP went out to waiting area with cool paper towels, found pt with head on left shoulder and eyes closed.  NP tapped pt on shoulder and asked if he was ok, pt became alert immediately.  Pt&#39;s face was pale and shirt was very sweaty.  He said that this had happened a couple of times before when he has received immunizations.  Placed wet paper towels on pt&#39;s forehead and neck.  He drank some water.  He said that he was feeling better as soon as he came to.  Color was coming back into his face.  NP monitored pt directly for 15 minutes more after this. BP at this point was 100/64, pulse 72.  Color was back to pt&#39;s face, had him stand up for 2 minutes before allowing him to leave the clinic area.

A 19-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0187, NDC number and Expiration date are Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 22May2021 11:30 (at the age of 19-years-old) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of historical vaccine, bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0176, NDC number and Expiration date are Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 01May2021 10:30 (at the age of 19-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect were none. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations were none. Family medical history relevant to adverse events was none. Relevant tests were unknown. It was reported that her 19-year-old son got the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 22May2021 and 2 days later on 24May2021, he wound up with chest pain and the caller took him to emergency room and the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis and admitted to the hospital. The Reporter clarified the patient&#39;s chest pain started when he woke up around 08:30-09:00. On an unspecified date in May2021 at 23:30, the patient had a fever starting about 12 hours from receiving the second dose and it lasted for 24 hours, and the patient didn&#39;t feel well on an unspecified date in May2021. At one point he didn&#39;t want to wake his parents up around 11:30 p.m. but he was warm on an unspecified date in May2021. At 0600am the next day, the caller took the patient&#39;s temperature, and his fever was 100.9 Fahrenheit. The caller carried the patient to the emergency room on 24May2021 due to his chest pain. It was reported that patient&#39;s EKG was extremely irregular and caller stated that if it was her or her husband&#39;s EKG, they would have been having an MI, but since the patient was only 19, the doctors didn&#39;t think MI was possible. The patient was then diagnosed with myocarditis. It was reported that the patient experienced diarrhea on 24May2021. Chest Pain required a visit to Emergency Room on 24May2021 and the patient was hospitalized from 24May2021 to 26May2021. It was reported that, the patient received treatment with Colchicine 0.6 mg (NDC number and Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: 26may2022) one tablet by mouth twice a day. The patient came home from the hospital with this prescription on 26May2021 and he is still taking this medication. Prescribed to take it twice daily for a month. Famotidine, it is like a Pepcid. 20 mg (NDC number and Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: 26Mayy2021) one tablet by mouth twice a day for 6 days, because of the heavy dose of ibuprofen and diarrhea. The patient had completed this medication. Ibuprofen 600 mg (NDC number, Lot number: unknown and Expiration Date: unknown) 1 tablet by mouth three times a day for six days and this has script had ended. Caller stated that her son was recovered but that he was still taking the treatment medications at this time. Caller stated that her son&#39;s symptoms are improved, he was not complaining of chest pain anymore, she assumes his myocarditis was improved because he was not complaining of the chest pain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 100.9 Fahrenheit on an unspecified date in May2021, EKG (electrocardiogram): extremely irregular on 24May2021, PCR COVID test (sars-cov-2 test): negative on an unspecified date in May2021 while in the hospital. Caller stated the patient had an EKG showing irregular heartbeat.It was reported that the patient had tests but she didn&#39;t have results available and the patient had a PCR COVID test in the ER. Caller stated that all of this was related to the vaccine. Caller also stated that she is wondering if her son would have reacted differently if he had gotten the Moderna, but caller and her husband had gotten Pfizer and didn&#39;t have any problems. Reporter seriousness for Myocarditis, diarrhea and fever was unspecified. The outcome of the events, Myocarditis, chest pain, diarrhea and irregular heartbeat was recovering and for fever was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021 and for other events was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.

The patient had syncope about 2 minutes after sitting and fell from a seated position on his chair to the ground. He had a brief seizure (unresponsive, tense muscles, open eyes) for about 2-5 seconds. He then became responsive and was able to respond to prompts and questions. He was given water. an ice pack (for injured spot on forehead), and told to wait for 30 minutes for further observation. He arranged to have a friend pick him up to take him home from the pharmacy and was told that he could not drive himself home after this adverse reaction. The patient stated that he otherwise felt normal afterwards (aside from some ache from the forehead after falling).

Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

Patient was seated in waiting area and around 6:10PM a loud noise was made due to metal chairs moving in the waiting area; upon turning around patient was face down on the floor with his head turned to one side. I ran to offer assistance and cushioned his head with my hands. EMS was dispatched immediately. Patient was already starting to come to after losing consciousness for approximately 10-15 seconds, looked confused for about 15 seconds and then seemed to return to a normal mental state immediately after. He was able to give his name and info and knew exactly where he was, etc. and he stated he felt much better. He was able to confirm he hit the side of his head on the floor, however it was not bleeding. I asked if he wanted me to call anyone for him but refused the offer. His blood pressure was taken at 6:15PM by us then again when EMS arrived at approximately 6:20PM and was 140/100. He was checked out by EMS, including a blood glucose reading of 81 and seemed to be okay. They offered to take him via ambulance to the hospital, especially given him hitting his head, but he refused the offer. He explained a similar incident occurred when he received IV contrast dye in the past. He was able to sit up and then stand up without any issues. He continued to wait in the waiting area for about 10 more minutes before leaving to ensure he felt back to normal. I followed up with him at 8:20PM via telephone and he stated he was feeling normal and had no questions/concerns. I assured him he could reach back out to me personally or the store here if he had any questions/concerns in the future.

He waived at us and sat down. We asked if he was ok and he waived again stating he didn&#39;t feel well. He sat back down and we proceeded to check on him. As we were coming to check on him, he fainted and fell face forward on to the floor. We called 911 and rolled him gently to his back. He had a laceration  above his eye from the fall. EMT came and assessed the patient. After observation, he was allowed to be picked up from his friend and taken to a clinic for stitches.

Patient was admitted into the hospital for 2 days (4/27-4/29) for this substernal chest pain. A CTPE, EKG, and CXR were ordered that were unrevealing as to the etiology of the chest pain. Troponins were elevated on admission with a slightly decreased delta (515-&gt;479). An ECHO was ordered that showed a LVEF of 35-40% with moderate global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, right ventricles moderately dilated, and no pericardial effusion.  A Cardiac MRI was then ordered to determine etiology that showed subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement of the basal inferior and mid-inferior and inferoseptal wall consistent with acute myocarditis. Additionally, a small pericardial effusion without signs of inflammation, calcification, or cardiac tamponade physiology. Patient was then D/C on 4/29 after the cardiac MRI with no medical therapy with the recommendation to not partake in physical activity for one month. Will have follow up with cardiology clinic in 1 month and will participate in cardiac rehab.

He was found to have markedly elevated troponins without EKG changes.  He was admitted to the hospital for evaluation and monitoring where cardiac MRI showed myocardial infllammation consistent with myocarditis. There was no other apparent cause based on patient&#39;s history.  He was found to have a reduced ejection fraction on echocardiogram as a result of his myocarditis.  He continued to have dyspnea on exertion at discharge.

A 20-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0151), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 15Apr2021, as second dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and allergies to tree nuts and penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate (FLOVENT), salbutamol sulfate (ALBUTEROL), and an unspecified multivitamin. The patient previously took montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) and bacitracin/ neomycin sulfate/ polymyxin B sulfate (TRIPLE ANTIBIOTIC Ointment) and experienced allergies to both; and the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ER8727) on 19Mar2021 at the age of 20 years for COVID-19 immunization (right arm). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. On 15Apr2021, the patient experienced initial anxiety or panic after shot was given. On 16Apr2021 (next day), the patient had fever and fatigue. The second day after (17Apr2021), the patient had shortness of breath and chest tightness. After several trips to the emergency room, the primary care physician (PCP) did laboratory tests that diagnosed an overactive thyroid (17Apr2021). Symptoms still remain and are being treated by an endocrinologist. Treatments included methimazole, lorazepam (ATIVAN), and diltiazem. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office or clinic visit and emergency room or department or urgent care. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient had not recovered from the events.

                                                Experienced mild chest pain two days after vaccination. Visited the ER, and was Hospitalized due to a decreased ejection fraction and elevated cardiac enzymes.  My ejection fraction returned to normal the following day, and I showed a decrease in cardiac enzymes. The pain also subsided about 36hrs after starting. I remained at hospital for a few days to have a cardiac MRI which showed patchy myocarditis. I was discharged that day, and have been taking metoprolol and avoiding physical exertion.  Later, on May 13th I returned to the ER due to an increase in heart palpitations. They turned out to be PVC, which is generally harmless, but I began taking a potassium supplement since my levels were low. I&#39;ve been taking it easy since.  Currently, I am expected to avoid exercise and exertion for six months, but am waiting for a follow-up to get more details.

He stated he felt dizzy and collapsed immediately, falling forward and hitting chin on desk. He was partially caught by RPH and nurse immediately attended to him. The patient woke immediately and said he could breathe easily and slowly sat up. Vital signs were stable, he rested for about 30 minutes, drank several bottles of water and felt better. Patient went home on his own accord and denied further medical evaluation.

Unfortunately, study was suboptimal but showed possible subsegmental PE vs mixing defect and consolidation in lingula consistent with pneumonia vs pulmonary infarct from PE.  Scan initially read as more likely pneumonia but patient without consistent symptoms and re-read as concerning for pulmonary embolism.  Patient otherwise healthy without other risk factors for PE.  Repeat CTA 2 weeks later with better quality without e/o PE and improving but not resolved opacity in lingula.  LE dopplers 3 wks after onset w/o DVT.  Hypercoaguable labs pending.

This lasted for ~15 seconds. After this, the patient immediately regained consciousness, had no issues breathing, and was able to talk. Patient reported light-headed. 911 was called immediately upon reaction, first responders came in and took patient&#39;s BP and glucose. Glucose 91 mg/dL, BP was low (forget exact value), but returned to normal (~117/80) after about 10 minutes. Patient seemed fully conscious and aware, opted to not go to the hospital and signed a declination form of transport. First responders deemed that the patient was aware and did not necessarily need transport to the ER. Patient requested a ride home from friend/family member and is going home to rest.

A 20-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 13May2021 at 11:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient is very strict on his health. The patient is a vegetarian, he is very health conscious. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on Apr2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced tenderness at the shot site and was very tired. On the morning of 14May2021, the patient had a small temperature that was one degree higher than before and the patient was wiped out tired-extremely exhausted and tired. Then the patient started experiencing chest pain within days of the second dose. The patient woke up on 15May2021 with chest pain that was persistent through 18May2021. On 19May2021, the chest pain got worse. The reporter thought the patient had indigestion so she gave the patient Tylenol, Pepcid, and clear soda and the patient felt a little better. On 20May2021, the patient was clutching his chest and had pain in his left arm. The patient couldn&#39;t talk, the pain was so hard. The patient went to the emergency room at 12:00 and the healthcare team said that the patient was experiencing a heart attack (reported time of heart attack was 10:00). The patient was not admitted to the hospital. They said the chemical that the large muscle in the heart makes, it was elevated which was how they determined it was a heart attack. These lab numbers were drawn every three hours and they came down but never went away. The patient had two Troponin draws and they were both elevated. They also did an EKG on the patient which showed a heart attack. The patient was told to see a cardiologist and was sent home. The reporter is watching the patient and the patient is still in a little bit of pain but not as much. The patient went to his primary care provider on the day of the report and the doctor doesn&#39;t see this as a displaced issue. The doctor does not know what would cause this in the heart. The patient is to see the cardiologist on Tuesday, 25May2021. The reporter is unsure if this is related to the vaccine but it was almost a week after the patient&#39;s second dose. The outcome of the event small temperature that was one degree higher than before was recovering and the outcome of the event wiped out tired-extremely exhausted and tired was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested

I called the pt the next day to follow up and patient was fine. No other issues.

                                                When reviewing forms with patient the patient disclosed a shellfish allergy. He described the symptoms of his skin turning red, shaking, and swelling in his throat as swelling in the past. He indicated that he had needed to use an epi pen in the past for his allergy.  He still wanted the vaccination and knew we had an epi pen handy.  He was given the vaccination in his left arm and was set up next to the staff development employee who was timing and monitoring patient&#39;s for symptoms. An epi pen was given to the monitor so it would be handy.  The patient&#39;s right hand started shaking within a minute and it was hard to tell if it was from being anxious.  Patient continued to communicate verbally and stated he wanted to use the epi pen.  911 was called by the staff and the staff member with the epi pen took it and the patient out of the main area. Paramedics transported him to the hospital with slight tachycardia and never did administer epi pen while in facility. Patient was always conscious and able to verbally communicate.

This was followed by chest pains.  These chest pains prompted him to seek care in the ER.  Upon workup, I found the patient to have developed myocarditis with a significantly elevated troponin prompting hospitalization.

Blood pressure was fine she said along with O2 levels. Left around 11:25 after I felt able to.   We both think this was likely related to the anxiety about getting the shot itself (I have anxiety in general so it was not paired with a mistrust or anything about the vaccine) and began fainting 7 minutes after getting the vaccine. I was anxious about any possible symptoms and needles/shots/blood draws make me feel uneasy. However, this issue was not present with the first shot.

                                                Patient said he felt light-headed after his shot. He was advised to continue sitting in the vaccine area. Since he was feeling light-headed, the immunizing pharmacist told me to get the blood pressure cuff. When I got back, the patient passed out. The pharmacist and I moved the chair from underneath him and he gently put him on the floor. He quickly woke up and the pharmacist began to ask him questions such as his name and where he was to make sure he was ok. He was able to answer those questions fine and we placed him in a chair so he can rest. When he was in the chair, he began to pass out again. He quickly woke up again but wasn&#39;t feeling good. The pharmacist checked his blood pressure and it was low. His temperature was at 93F. The pharmacist continued to stay with him and he made sure that someone else was able to come and pick him up. Once he felt ok, he had the patient go sit in the post-vaccination waiting area until he had his ride pick him up.

                                                Patient received vaccine in left arm (deltoid). Was in post vaccination observation area. About 5 minutes after the injection, while sitting in the observation chairs, the patient fainted and hit his head on the floor. Pharmacist and patient&#39;s father got him back up into the chair. Patient quickly regained consciousness, but felt nauseous and warm. Patient was given a little water. But could carry-on a conversation.  Patient vomited a little into a trash can. About 10 additional minutes went by. Patient was able to get up out of the chair and walk out of the facility with the help of his family. Patient had a little bit of bump on head where he had struck the floor, no bleeding occurred. No additional medical assistance was contacted at that time by the facility, family, or the pharmacist. Pharmacist called the patient several hours to after to see how he was doing, but did not get a response. The pharmacist left a voicemail. It is unknown to the pharmacist whether or not the family decided it was necessary to get medical follow-up or not after the incident.

Patient says that he was in his USOH until yesterday when he started having substernal chest pain which was getting worse with inspiration but also with specific movements. He does have pain even at rest sometimes but he thinks that it&#39;s exacerbating by breathing. Had some nausea/vomiting as well. Denies other symptoms. Not really sob or leg swelling.    In the ER, his Trop I was 10.7 and his WBC was 12.2. His EKG was NSR with short PR and STE I, II, III, AVF, V4-V6  Patient is a 21 y.o. male with no past medical history who got his second dose of COVID (Pfizer) vaccine on Saturday presented with chest pain since Sunday with some pleuritic characteristics. He was found to have a very elevated trop I to 10.7, leukocytosis to 12.2 and STE in I, II, III, AVF, V4-V6. His POCUS in the ER was without significant pericardial effusion and probably normal EF. Differential at this point includes pericarditis vs myopericarditis (there are some myocarditis cases reported in Israel post Pfizer vaccination, predominantly in young male patients) vs less likely ACS. Will need admission and further work up and treatment        -Admission to Cardiology -NPO in case team tomorrow decides to proceed to LHC  -Full echo and cardiac MRI tomorrow  -Telemetry monitoring  -Repeat EKG q4h overnight  -send CRP, ESR -trend Trop to peak  -would not start heparin gtt at this point  -Please start tonight ASA 650 TID &#43; Colchicine 0.6 mg BID   21-year-old man admitted with signs and symptoms of acute myo-pericarditis or in the setting of recent COVID-19 vaccination.  He apparently had the findings are vaccine 2 days ago and developed pleuritic chest pain.  His ECG shows pathognomonic changes for pericarditis in the is a small troponin elevation.  He has no past medical history or exertional symptoms to suggest CAD.  Bedside echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular systolic function.  He was admitted and placed on aspirin and colchicine.  A cardiac MRI today showed evidence of myopericarditis.  He had 3 beats of nonsustained VT on tele.

Patient was seen at Per internal reported event: 21 y.o.male with PMH significant for asthma who was admitted 5/15/2021 with CP.  Pt had Pfizer COVID vaccine #2 on 5/12.  He developed fever and myalgias on 5/13.  These had recovered by 5/14 - only complaint was sore arm and underarm swelling on the L.  By 5/15, pt had severe CP with dyspnea.  Taken to ED - noted to have elevated troponin and ST elevation on EKG.  Now s/p LHC today - coronaries clean.  Echo without wmas.  Cardiology suspects acute myocarditis.  No pericardial effusion to suggest pericarditis.

                                                Pericarditis diagnosis:  This is a 21 year old male who presented to the emergency department on 4/27/21 with a two-day history of chest pain.  He was seen in a  emergency department on 4/26 and reported a normal EKG, blood work, and x-ray.  He was discharged home.  His was worsened so he reported to an urgent care in .  That team had a concern for pericarditis, so referred the patient to the  emergency room.  He had a reproducible pain over the costal margin but did describe a positional component.  Provider felt they still had to consider pericarditis as well as costochondritis.  The suspicion for pulmonary embolism or acute coronary syndrome or very low.  The suspicion also for myocarditis was low.  His EKG did show some J-point elevation versus ST elevation in the anterior and lateral leads.  There was no evidence of reciprocal depression.  His troponin test was normal.  His CBC and metabolic panel were normal.  He had had CRP which was mildly elevated at 4.6. A bedside point-of-care ultrasound showed no evidence of a pericardial effusion.  Provider felt it was reasonable to treat him for pericarditis although his EKG is not classic for this.  It was recommended he use his scheduled ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times a day.  He was also given a 1 month course of daily colchicine 0.6 mg. It was recommend he follow closely with his PCP to see if he needs to have this colchicine course extended.  He will follow-up with his primary doctor in 1 week for repeat check.

He was noted to be tachycardic and hypotensive with a severe leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers and &#43; troponin, and an LVEF 35-40%. He was referred to tertiary care center, had a cardiac MRI that showed little inflammation but LVEF now 12%.  On 5/21/21 he was started on high dose steroids and placed on mechanical circulatory support with VA ECMO.  Cardiac function quickly improved and he is ready to come off VA ECMO 5/29 with an LVEF improved to &gt; 40% during weaning trials.

When the pharmacist went to release him, he was pale, dizzy, and clammy. He stated that he did not feel good. The pharmacist fanned him to cool  him down. She also gave him a wet rag to wipe his forehead. He was given two teaspoonful of Benadryl 12.5mg/ 5ml. The patient stated that he was feeling dizzy and thought he was going to faint. The pharmacy called 911. The patient removed his jacket and mask as he was hot. The EMT arrived and walked him outside* I am not sure what happened after that

                                                Patient passed out, syncope episode while waiting in lobby after vaccine administration.   Technician alerted pharmacist.   Pharmacist immediately got red immunization emergency bag and approached patient.  I introduced myself  and prepared to activate the emergency response system (as recommended during CPR) but he had good pulse and respiration and immediately he spontaneously recovered!   We asked him to stay to be observed and offered him some water and food.  He accepted the water.   We did a wellness check phone call with him later in the afternoon to confirm that he was doing well, and he was.

                                                The patient appears to have developed acute myopericarditis within 3 days of receiving the vaccine.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 22-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/ Lot Number and expiry date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 (at the age of 22-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food or other products. Patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks of vaccination. Patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Patient has not COVID, prior vaccination. On 03Apr2021, the patient appears to have developed acute myopericarditis within 3 days of receiving the vaccine (adverse event result in Emergency room/department or urgent care). Patient received treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and colchicine. Patient has been tested for COVID in 2021, post vaccination, Test type: Nasal Swab and result was negative. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Additional information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the known vaccine safety profile the causal association between the reported event patient appears to have developed acute myopericarditis within 3 days of receiving the vaccine and the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 is unlikely but cannot be completely excluded because of strong temporal association between the event and the suspected vaccine. The case will be assessed once the new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Felt fine day of vaccine, Sunday, just minor arm pain. Woke up the next morning with pretty severe fatigue and more arm pain. Around 11am I had pretty bad chills that lasted about an hour, along with minor nausea. Additionally,  throughout most of the day my heart rate was usually between 90-100 bpm, even while lying down and doing nothing.  Going to sleep on Monday night I woke around 3 times during the night with cold sweats. Waking up on Tuesday morning, my heart rate is still elevated, arm is still sore, but the fatigue isn&#39;t as bad. However, at around 9am on Tuesday morning I started to develop itchy hives and a rash on the back of my legs.  After the first dose I only had a sore arm, no symptoms like these, and I do not have any known allergies.

                                                Approximately five days after receiving the vaccine, I had a strange feeling in the left side of my chest as if something was swollen. It was not pain, but rather a feeling as if something inside was &#34;enlarged&#34; or heavy. Shortly after, I also had sharp pains on the left side which would come once or twice a day and last 1-2 seconds at most. As of now (day 13), I either do not feel the heaviness anymore or I am not noticing it anymore. The sharp pains have become very infrequent but I do often feel a mild soreness in the left side of my chest which lasts for about half an hour and gradually subsides.

A 22-years-old male patient (Son) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. My son is having a tough time with the vaccine. Everyday he has a couple of side effects. He started with body ache and tiredness on unspecified date Apr2021. He had a pounding headache. His headache was moderate today. However, the headache symptoms are getting worst. Generally, the symptoms last a day his have been getting worst for 7 days. He has been taking Tylenol and Advil. But the Advil doesn&#39;t even seem to hep anymore.&#34; headache is a common side effect reported with the vaccine. If the symptoms persists or get worst please consult your HCP. Please note blood clot has not been associated with the vaccine. Patient is been experiencing what I considered to be pretty severe, I guess reaction in term of aches and headache. This morning he woke up with the pounding headache, he kid described it as pounding and I just I guess I want to ask because everywhere I read, it says mild headaches are common and aches and I understand that but I guess understanding why this, this is considered somewhat as severe reaction or is there anything he can do to alleviate the symptom and should he, I guess my question is actually I guess my question also is should he not possibly get the second dose if he is experiencing such bad headaches with the first dose. When paraphrased the concern, reporter stated, Yes, basically we are thinking if can do to alleviate it and then he could not get the second dose, if you have any advice, I guess and just let you know he went to his health center in the college he went to get a COVID test and a flu test just to make sure he doesn&#39;t have actual Covid or flu and those report I got yesterday and so they told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. When probed for event start date, reporter stated, I would say a day after, I would say 09Apr2021, I guess it&#39;s phantom (not clarified) with symptom, the first day he was just tired, as far as the headache that started on the 09Apr2021. He (son) also passed out after the vaccine, which I also did that I didn&#39;t have Pfizer I (reporter) had Moderna and I had that same reaction, so I think that sometimes happens to some people but that&#39;s it happens also. When probed for vaccination anatomical site, reporter stated, Outside of the body I guess, I don&#39;t know that for sure. Patient still having the problem (event), and out event outcome, reporter stated, Yes, I think persisting, I think it varies. Patient has been taking Advil (Ibuprofen) and Tylenol (treatment). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included influenza virus test: negative on 12Apr2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 12Apr2021. They told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of body ache (pain), tiredness (fatigue), pounding headache/headache symptoms are getting worst (headache). The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  QR Comment: Call handler not filed split case. Might have been split case.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients (twins). This is the first of two reports.  A 22-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 26Apr2021 10:00, as 2nd dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included ongoing rare metabolic disorder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.

On the same day, 27Apr2021, the patient had severe chest pain, chest tightness, and lightheadedness. On 28Apr2021, the pain didn&#39;t go away, and the twins had elevated ST evaluation on the EKG (electrocardiograph). ST evaluation was done by the reporter&#39;s husband who is a retired firefighter emergency medical technician. The reporter decided to take the patient to hospital and said that the other twin had the same symptoms but kept saying his wasn&#39;t as bad as his brother&#39;s because he did not want to go to the hospital. The doctor advised the reporter to bring the other twin. The twins had the same echo cardiogram on 28Apr2021 (unknown results). On 28Apr2021, their troponin levels were elevated, and their cardiac enzymes continued to go up. On the same day, 28Apr2021, the patient had a strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe. It was reported that the twins were hospitalized on 28Apr2021 with myocarditis/pericarditis and inflammation around the heart. Treatment for myocarditis/pericarditis included ibuprofen and colchicine; and Toradol for breakthrough pain. The reporter stated that the twins are two identical males with the same DNA, had the vaccine at the same time, had the reactions at the same length of time, have the same lifestyle and live at the same house. The reporter said it would go a long way if they help her understand the complication. The patient recovered &#34;strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe&#34; on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the event myocarditis and pericarditis/inflammation around the heart was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021487544 same reporter, suspect drugs and events; different patients

                                                A few days after being vaccinated, I had experienced dizziness, fainting while at physical therapy. When laid on the table, I noticed I had tightness in my chest, like I couldn&#39;t catch my breath. They took my blood pressure, and It was 136/88 pulse rate of 88. These issues continued to persist. I went to the doctors to discuss the issue with a PA. She took an EKG, and found no abnormalities, although I wasn&#39;t having an episode at the time. I later felt palpitations in my chest. (my heart would race spontaneously at times for no longer than a few seconds.) The PA as well as my Doctor, had confirmed I had high blood pressure.  I began to eat healthier and lose weight in order to change the blood pressure issues. The first appointment, I was 284. The second appointment which was in late April, I was 264, and my blood pressure was in the mid 120&#39;s over upper 70&#39;s, with my pulse rate in the 70&#39;s. The most recent appointment, I became more liberal with my diet and gained weight, weighing 268, but my heart rate continued to lower to a normal point, regardless (low 120&#39;s over 68, Pulse rate in the 60&#39;s.) Dr. and I had discussed possible causes, and I still have a cardiology appointment to follow up with, and we agreed that with the recent notice of myocarditis in vaccinated young adults and kids, it&#39;s a strong possibility the vaccine may have caused my issues, although I am to follow through with the cardiologist to confirm these suspicions.

                                                There was a thumping and tightness in my chest centered around my heart, as well as pain in my left arm that traveled, fulfilling the textbook definition of a heart attack. I went to the ER, got an EKG and it looked normal. The tightness lasted for the next few days, and occasionally persists to today (March 27th). After two blood tests, X ray, and blood pressure they determined my troponin levels were not only measurable, they were increasing, so I was admitted to the hospital. I was given aspirin for 30 days, and told to leave caffeine alone for that time, but I was cleared of the daily aspirin doses and allowed to consume caffeine again after approximately two weeks. Furthermore, I was prescribed nitroglycerin pills incase it should happen again. Doctors concluded that one of my heart valves had a spasm, triggering the event.

                                                Chest Pain, Myopericarditis; From EPIC: From cardiologist healthy man who comes to the ER with left anterior chest discomfort for the last 36 hours or so.  Symptoms are made worse by deep inspiration.  Were improved following self administration of 600 mg of ibuprofen earlier today.  2 days ago he received his second COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer).  Following day he experienced arm pain muscular aches and pains severe discomfort of the right arm (injection site) later in the day there was nausea and vomiting on one occasion (nonheme).  By last night he was able to eat dinner but subsequently felt short of breath with worsening chest discomfort morning the left arm continued to ache with musculoskeletal pains.  Developed more discomfort in the left anterior chest radiating to the throat made worse by deep inspiration. Does not describe typical sharp catching pain of pericarditis.  No cough sputum bruising bleeding abdominal pain change in color or character of bowels.  Sign in the emergency room he was hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm with a normal EKG.Torrey work-up notable for an initial troponin of 1.28 and a follow-up troponin of 2.14. Chest x-ray perfectly normal. Elevated d-dimer. CT angiography negative for pulmonary embolism vascular injury, cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion but the radiologist did note thickening of several right posterior and lateral axillary lymph nodes raising a question of recent right-sided vaccination or injury/infection to the right arm. Presently he is perfectly comfortable able to take a deep inspiration with mild chest discomfort, breathing easily.  I met him in July 2018He came to the emergency room with a 3-day viral syndrome manifested as headache nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal discomfort and then developed chest discomfort.  He was found with diffuse mild J-point elevation on EKG consistent with a viral type pericarditis with troponins which rose to a maximum of 10.4.  Work-up for myocarditis was negative.  Echocardiogram perfectly normal.  Symptoms responded to a course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine.  Seen in follow-up of repeat echocardiogram was perfectly healthy.  Our diagnosis was myopericarditis. There is no history of shortness of breath dyspnea on exertion decrement of exercise capacity peripheral edema orthopnea PND palpitations lightheadedness syncope or collapse.  No ill contacts.  He works in a high security position and therefore qualified for early administration of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  Graph past medical history notable only for the episode of myopericarditis and a remote tonsillectomy. There is no significant family history of sudden cardiac death or unusual heart disease. He takes no medications. Patient was recommended to take 4 weeks of ibuprofen and colchicine if needed for worsening chest pain.  Patient was recommended to follow-up closely with his primary care doctor and check ESR, C-reactive protein as well as renal function.  Needs close follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.

He was transferred to hospital for emergent cath amid concern for possible STEMI, which showed no coronary artery disease. Echo showed normal LV function. Cardiac MRI demonstrates myocardial edema consistent with myocarditis. He was treated with corticosteroids for presumed vaccine-associated myocarditis.

                                                Reason for Admission  Patient 22-year-old male with a history of seasonal allergic asthma who presented to ER with a chief complaint of chest pain.  He said he started having multiple episodes of vomiting/fever on Saturday morning, went to urgent care and diagnosed with sinus infection,  prescribed amoxicillin, then  he started having chest pain on Sunday at 4 PM, mid sternum, constant, pressure type of pain, 5 out of 10 in severity, worse with cough and deep breathing/lying down flat a lateral position, better with sitting up/ leaning forward.  No radiation.  Denies lifting any heavy weight or any heavy exercise.  Never had similar symptoms in the past.  He had his second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on May 12.  He denies leg pain or swelling.  His vomiting and fever resolved.   ED: He was found to have troponin of more than 12,000, EKG showed diffuse ST segment elevation with possible repolarization.   Transferred for possible cardiac cath/cardiac MRI.  CT angio chest no PE, normal aorta, no infiltration.  Pending second set of troponin, stat echo, aspirin po  given in the ER.   In addition to the above HPI, he reports having 2 days of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  T-max 103F.  His chest pain began around 4 PM yesterday and he felt like it was initially consistent with his asthma, however it did not improve so around 1:30 AM he states they went to the ER.  He states that the chest pain gets better with exertion, and is worse with deep breaths and lying on his side, or leaning forward. He did take Nyquil decongestant which contains phenylephrine.     Hospital Course   22 yo M w/PMH exercise induced asthma admitted for evaluation of CP, elevated troponin to 21,292 with negative LHC. UDS Negative. EKG w/diffuse ST changes so consistent with Myopericarditis I31.9 given Recent Viral Illness resulting in first time myopericarditis, will treat per pericarditis algorithm, ASA&#43;Colchicine w/90% response rate by 1 week.     -ASA 650 to 1000 mg TID, weekly tapers if CRP normalized and sx free; will start at 650 mg dose   -Colchicine 0.6 mg BID for 3 months, no taper (lowers recurrence rate, NNT = 5)   -Glucocorticoid generally not indicated in first-time acute myopericarditis as observational studies suggest increased recurrence rate, but can consider if he does not adequately respond to aspirin and colchicine   -Trend troponin to ensure downtrend continues   -No strenuous exercise during recovery period

Both of my arms had a very tingly feeling and felt  heavy  and then became completely  numb and I was unable to move to either arm for approximately 45 minutes.  Movement slowly came back  throughout the evening and over the next week. My legs felt tingly and heavy. I continue to have periodic tingly feeling in my joints through out my body. My chest felt heavy.  I felt like I was doing to die.  Large red swollen area where shot was given. I have COVID 19 in Feb, 2021. Health care profession suspects the reaction may have been related to having COVID-19, second dose not recommended. Likely to have antibodies. I have not felt 100 percent since receiving vaccine.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) and a contactable other healthcare professional. This consumer reported similar events for two patients (twins). This is the first of two reports.  A 22-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 26Apr2021 10:00 (at the age of 22-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included ongoing rare metabolic disorder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735) received at age 22 years, on 05Apr2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. On 26Apr2021, the patient received the second dose of BNT162B2. In the evening of the same day, 26Apr2021, the patient experienced tiredness/fatigue, and headache. In the morning of 27Apr2021, the patient was feeling really crappy and they though it was like the flu and it would pass. In the evening of 27Apr2021, the patient didn&#39;t sleep at all and was uncomfortable all night and pain. On the same day, 27Apr2021, the patient had severe chest pain, chest tightness, and lightheadedness. On 28Apr2021, the pain didn&#39;t go away, and the twins had elevated ST evaluation on the EKG (electrocardiograph). ST evaluation was done by the reporter&#39;s husband who is a retired firefighter emergency medical technician. The reporter decided to take the patient to hospital and said that the other twin had the same symptoms but kept saying his wasn&#39;t as bad as his brother&#39;s because he did not want to go to the hospital. The doctor advised the reporter to bring the other twin. The twins had the same echo cardiogram on 28Apr2021 (unknown results). On 28Apr2021, their troponin levels were elevated, and their cardiac enzymes continued to go up. On the same day, 28Apr2021, the patient had a strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe. It was reported that the twins were hospitalized on 28Apr2021 with myocarditis/pericarditis and inflammation around the heart. Treatment for myocarditis/pericarditis included ibuprofen and colchicine; and Toradol for breakthrough pain. The reporter stated that the twins are two identical males with the same DNA, had the vaccine at the same time, had the reactions at the same length of time, have the same lifestyle and live at the same house. The reporter said it would go a long way if they help her understand the complication. The patient recovered &#34;strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe&#34; on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the event myocarditis and pericarditis/inflammation around the heart was not recovered.

A 23-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 28Dec2020 15:00 at single dose for prevention for Covid-19. The patient medical history included electrolyte imbalance. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid, rosa canina (VITAMIN C WITH ROSE HIPS), zinc, vitamin  D3, all started from Dec2020 (18 or 19Dec2020) and ongoing for &#34;immune system&#34;. At 3pm yesterday (28Dec2020) he received the vaccine. He experienced feeling light headed and his heart was racing a minute after receiving the vaccine. Around 11-12pm he was itching on his arm, abdomen and back. He took an allergy pill and rubbed hydrocortisone cream on his back, arm and armpit. After taking the medication and rubbing the cream the bumps went down 30 minutes to an hour later. He woke today and everything was clearing. These symptoms usually hit him from having an electrolyte imbalance. He had missed the past 2 doses of Vitamin C, Zinc and Vitamin D3. He had 2 Covid test prior to getting the vaccine. His height was 6 feet 3 or 6 feet 4. He started like itching like all over his body. He noticed some rashes and some bumps in his body, it was like an allergy. He was just wondering if this was like the allergic reaction the medication that causes it. The outcome of the events light headed and heart was racing was recovered on 28Dec2020 15:01 and the outcome of the other events was recovered on an unknown date in Dec2020.

I just need some sugar like juice.&#34; He denied difficulty breathing or chest pain. He was not nauseous nor did he vomit. I transported him to a private holding room via wheelchair and gave him a 12 oz can of Coca-Cola. He took sips and immediately reported feeling better. The initial vital signs I took were as follows: Temp 98.6 F, HR 67, BP 84/48 mmHg, RR 24/min, and SpO2 97%.  After recheck in 15 min BP improved to 106/62 mmHg, his became more pink and no more diaphoresis. I observed him for 30 minutes total and he was stable to go home. He drove himself home.

He then became very pale and fainted while in the vaccination chair. After a few seconds he regained consciousness. We then helped him to the floor and elevated his legs and placed a cold pack on his neck. He started feeling better instantly but we kept him there for about 5 minutes. We then had him move to a chair and the technician sat with him for an additional 40 minutes. He then said he was fine and that he has fainted before (which was not disclosed) and left.

                                                Passed out /Lost all awareness; Light-headed; Hyperventilating; He caught his breath; Elevated heart rate; Tingling sensation; He was unable to form cohesive sentences; Muscles movements were impeded; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EN6206) single dose, in the left arm, on 08Mar2021, at 11:45 AM, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had not received any other medications within 2 weeks. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not experienced COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Mar2021, at 12:00 PM, 5 minutes after vaccination, the patient became very light-headed. In a few seconds his vision went dark and he passed out. After an unknown amount of time, he became semiconscious and was hyperventilating. While hyperventilating, his eyes were open, but he could not see anything. Once he caught his breath, after about 15 seconds, his vision came back and he lost all awareness of where he was. After about 30 seconds, the patient realized he was in the observation area for the facility and alerted the medical professionals near his vehicle he was sitting in. Medical professionals checked his vitals, which were fine other than an elevated heart rate, and he had a tingling sensation over his body for the next two minutes. In this time, he was unable to form cohesive sentences, and his muscles movements were impeded. It took another 40 minutes to return to a relatively normal state. No treatment was received. The patient recovered from the adverse events. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

The day after I went to to urgent care jsut to check if anything was wrong. My blood pressure was elevated during this visit with a mesaurement of 134/79. Was told that for the next shot to tell the vaccine staff about my reaction and to wait for 30 min instead fo 15 min.

                                                Rash developed on thigh about 2 weeks after the 1st Pfizer vaccine; NOTHING else in life is novel, ie, no new foods, detergents, soaps; no traveling, no guests, and the patient abhors the outdoors so insect involvement is extremely unlikely. Rash was reported to me (Mom) on Thursday, April 1st. There was one spot/lesion that was oval and larger than the others, with a somewhat blanched center.  No itch or pain. Friday the 2nd, patient reported around 5:00 p.m. that it had spread to his sides, so I called the nurse healthline.. Saturday a.m. per recommendation I took him to Urgent Care; it had by then also spread to his stomach. The doctor there didn&#39;t have any &#34;A-HA!!&#34; moment, but sent us off with a prescription for a clotrimazole/betamethasone topical cream. The rash is now heavily populating his stomach, is on his back and there are a couple spots on his arm. I contacted his primary care manager this morning as we are to receive our 2nd Pfizer vaccines day after tomorrow (Wed, 4/7) and I&#39;m wondering if he should get his as planned or whether that might be a bad idea.

Response by staff was great: laid me down, brought a cot, regularly checked my heart rate, blood oxygen, and blood pressure until it returned to normal and waited to make sure the symptoms did not return.   Later that night, I started experiencing some of the typical COVID vaccine side effects: sore arm, chills, nausea, and fever-like symptoms; in addition to the symptoms I was warned was possible, I also experienced periods of dizziness and an uncomfortable sense of balance. Three days later, the dizziness and other common symptoms have gone away, but my sense of balance still feels off, although I do not know if related to the vaccine. It?s not so bad that I?m at risk of falling over, but I have a semi-regular feeling of unsteadiness which I cannot explain.

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

                                                On Saturday night (4/10) I had some chest pains that seemed to not go away in my upper left chest and left arm. I tried to sleep it off until the pain was unbearable at around 7:00 am on Monday (4/11). I then admitted myself to the ER and was given an ECG and multiple EKG?s as well. Upon lab results I had high triponin levels (28) leading the doctors to believe I had a heard attack of some sort, eventually they ruled it as acute pericarditis possibly due to my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

A 23-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 25Jan2021 (Lot Number: EL3247), as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient was vaccinated in the hospital. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient did not have known allergies. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Previously the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech, lot# EL0142) on 04Jan2021 at 11:30 AM in left arm and experienced nodule on extremity and vaccination site nodule. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis leg (medically significant, life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, nodule on both forearm (life threatening) on 25Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, swelling along veins and they became painful (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, swelling along veins and they became painful (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, 2 superficial venous thromboses, one in arm and another in leg (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered. It was reported that within hours from second dose the nodules reappeared. At this time, patient was told to take Allegra and did so for 4 weeks. A month later, patient began to see some swelling along his veins and they became painful. This developed into a DVT, deep venous thrombosis, in leg and 2 superficial venous thromboses, one in arm and another in leg. all the events required physician office visit. None of the events occurred at vaccination site, but physician believed they were triggered by receiving the vaccine. Treatment of Eliquis was initiated the day before report. Patient was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 23-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 22Apr2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included being a smoker (he vapes). The patient&#39;s sister has Addison&#39;s disease. There were no concomitant medications; no additional vaccines administered on the same date as BNT162B2 and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient previously received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EB8733) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 01Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 22Apr2021 at 14:00. He woke up on 23Apr2021 and felt like he had sinus pressure, then he blew his nose and had a bit of a nosebleed. He also felt like he could taste blood in his throat and mouth. The nosebleed stopped, but there was still some pressure in his sinuses. He asked if he needed to go to the hospital. He has a headache and it seemed like a sinus headache. It was more on the right side where he had the nosebleed. He could still kind of taste a little bit of blood in his mouth and throat. There were no relevant tests, but he was trying to figure out if it&#39;s needed. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. He was not hospitalized but he was trying to decide if he needed to go to the hospital. The outcome of the event nose bleed was recovered on 23Apr2021 and not recovered for all other events.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.  Follow-up (23Apr2021): New information from a contactable consumer (patient) includes: patient details, medical history, historical vaccine, therapy details, reaction data (&#34;Can taste blood in his throat and mouth&#34; and &#34;has a headache and it seems like a sinus headache&#34; were added; outcome and onset were updated), and course of events.

A 23-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 at 1 pm (around 12:20ish as reported) (Lot Number: FN6206) (at 23-year-old) at single dose in arm right for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history relevant to AEs. The patient stated he is a pretty healthy guy. All day after getting the vaccine he was fine. He got the shot at like 1 came home took a nap, ate some dinner, and was playing XBOX with the boys when this happened. At around 10:30 pm on 29Apr2021 he went to rub, his stomach just above his belly button and it hurt. He said that he read on line that that area is called the pancreas or liver, it has a lot of names for that area when looking online. He stated it&#39;s the left upper abdomen area he felt pain when he pressed on it. It radiated really fast across his abdomen while he was on the phone with mother. The more he pressed the more the pain got sharper, and it radiated right across the abdomen, mainly above belly button not too much in lower abdomen, not much in upper abdomen. It was very sensitive. He didn&#39;t have to press hard to trigger the pain. It was almost like the area was inflamed. It happened really fast and that it was his upper stomach not so much the lower part of his abdomen. He felt dizziness and nauseous and like a silly boy he tried to run to the bathroom. He stated that he fell and fainted. His butt was still a little sore from falling. He said when he woke up, he was sweating like he had been out side all day. He did not recall sweating any time he fainted in the past. The side effects were gone after about ten minutes. He was really light headed and had the crazy sharp pain in abdomen for about ten minutes and then it was gone. He had never had that kind of pain. He was laying on the floor for a couple minutes. He went to get his phone, and then sat back down and was sweating. He still had pain at that time but it only lasted about 10 minutes at most. He was still a little bit sore in some joints which was not unexpected. He confirmed that he had a little bit of sweating, and he fainted a little bit. Since the episode he hasn&#39;t felt any symptoms like that before, he has not had any pain like gastritis but he has had some random gastrointestinal things before. It&#39;s also reported nausea on 29Apr2021. No required to emergency room and physician office. He was on the verge of going to the ER while the pain was there. He was going to go until it stopped and to get checked out. No relevant test. The outcome of the events sore joints, dizziness and butt sore was unknown; for other events was resolved on 29Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I got my shot on a Friday afternoon. The following Tuesday afternoon, I was out running sprints with a friend. After a couple, I felt super winded, like I was gonna pass out. This was concerning since I run at least 30 miles a week.   Early the next morning, I woke up with my heart racing and shortness of breath. This persisted for a couple of hours. I woke up with a stiff chest, pain and aches around my body, and struggling to breathe. I went to urgent care and they did an EKG on me that came out abnormal. They referred me to a cardiologist where I got an appointment the next day.   The cardiologist runs another ekg this time it?s worse. She sends me straight to the ER. They run a bunch of tests but nothing is conclusive. I?m released the next evening.   The following Monday I had a checkup with my cardiologist and she referred me to someone she knows at a HCF. My appointment is not until the end of June

                                                About 2 days after I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I started experiencing chest pain and muscle cramps. On day 6 I experienced it the worst, my chest tensed up and all at once my left side of my body started cramping. Most noticeable of the pain was coming from my heart. It got better as the day ended. Noticed serious muscle cramps for the week after.

                                                Two days after receiving my first vaccine dose, I began to feel a tight, uncomfortable sensation in my chest. Over a few days it grew into pain that would become worse with physical activity or when lying down. I had pericarditis last year and recognized the symptoms but I chose to go to the hospital anyways to be safe. The doctors at the ER did not have a concrete answer for me but the cautiously assumed pericarditis.

                                                Patient was administed the pfizer covid-19 vaccine 1:24pm. After the vaccine was administered patient went to a designated chair to wait for 15 minutes post-vaccine. Pharmacist monitored patient, noticed patient sitting talking on the phone shortly after vaccine. However, after a couple minutes patient passed out and fell off of chair. After yelling patient&#39;s name he came to and did not lose consciousness again. Patient suffered injury on head with a substantial laceration on forehead above eye. Code white was called and patient was given an ice pack and advised to sit for 30 minutes following incident. Asked patient if he would like us to call 911, he refused. He sat with management while an incident report was filled out and while he didn&#39;t want us to call an ambulance it did seem as though his mom was going to take him to urgent care to have his cut examined.

                                                Patient developed chest pain symptoms on the evening of 5/13, he said symptoms waxed and waned but worsened on 5/16 which prompted him to go the Hospital ER.  There he was found to have an elevated troponin 27.9 and ST elevations on ECG.  This prompted an emergent evaluation by cardiology and patient underwent a Left Heart Catherization  (LHC) on 5/16 which showed no obstructive disease.  Cardiology suspected possible myocarditis which was confirmed on 5/18 with a cardiac MRI.  Patient also had an echocardiogram that showed mildly reduced systolic function EF 50-55% and mild hypokinesis in the left ventricle (echo obtained on 5/17).  Patient was discharged on two new medications: Losartan and metoprolol and has cardiology follow up on June 1.

But from that day until now I still get a weird feeling in my left chest. I feel like my heart is twitching sometimes. Sometimes I felt that my heart was pounding. Sometimes it feels like it&#39;s going to hurt my heart. It happened continuously about 5-6 times a day. Sometimes I was paranoid about it.

He sits down in the waiting area to be monitored. We heard his phone dropped, looked up and saw him tilting over on the right side was about to fall off the chair. Staff grabbed him and held him back onto the seat, proceeded to picked up his right arm and held him in place. He looked unconscious while staff held him. He came back to his senses approximately 10 seconds later. After he regained consciousness, staff took his blood pressure which was 111/44, SpO2 was 100%, and heart rate 58. Patient looked pale but not critical. Conversed with our staff and stated that this has happened before when he receives other vaccinations. Patient&#39;s father is a physician and reported that the patient is scared of needles and did not need any medications from anaphylaxis kit or crash cart. We gave him water and he left after sitting for a while.

                                                On Friday morning 2/26/21, we had a 24 yo male patient who had an anaphylactic reaction after his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He was instructed to wait on the chair, but had stood up at some point but was still in the pharmacy waiting area. A team member noticed he had fainted and called for help. The pharmacist on duty and immunizing tech came immediately to help him to a chair. At that point, he was conscious and talking. Then within a few seconds he started convulsing on the chair and lost consciousness. His eyes were open and head tilted back. A team member immediately called 911 and pharmacist administered 0.3mg Epipen to the thigh. We removed his face mask to check his breathing and also to allow him to breathe more easily. We also adjusted his head more forward and he started coughing. After about 15 seconds, he regained consciousness and could answer questions. EMT arrived soon after and took over. Patient does not have allergies or any history of anaphylaxis/ severe reaction from vaccinations. He did express some fear of needles and did not eat breakfast yet.

I was then moved to the observation area where my chest got tight, I had difficulty breathing and my temperature fluctuated which made me shake. When hives began to show on my face, neck and ears the on-site medical staff gave me a shot of epinephrine and Benadryl and put me on oxygen, during this time an ambulance was called by the staff. When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

                                                Nausea and Headaches occurred about 5 hours after the injection, since then they have come and gone periodically, usually lasting about 30 minutes, then going away for a few hours. I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

                                                got up about 5:15AM to use the restroom, parents heard a huge crash and we came running - he had collapsed and fainted in the bathroom, against the toilet, (with shelves and glass crashing down him - he grabbed the shelves and had a few cuts and bruises), was unresponsive, no color in his face, could not stand or move, could barely speak - slumped against the toilet.  Parents called 911 and tried to get him to respond, he was listless but opened his eyes - we lifted him and moved him to recliner in living room.  Fire Dept./EMT&#39;s arrived within a few minutes, blood pressure was 87/43, glucose was normal.  EMT&#39;s determined it was a reaction to the vaccine and asked if he wanted an ambulance or if parents should drive him for further care - he opted for us to drive him (his Mom called the Dr. on staff first - Dr. said it was a reaction to the vaccine and he should not get a 2nd dose).  Patient&#39;s Dad took him to Urgent Care - they ran an EKG (normal), and stayed there until his blood pressure showed (although still low)  normal/acceptable again.  I looked at the CDC website for covid anaphylaxis and it appears it was an allergic reaction (cardiovascular), on the site, he had these symptoms:  &#34;Cardiovascular: fainting; hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure); pallor.  ... Symptoms of anaphylaxis often occur within 15-30 minutes of vaccination, though it can sometimes take several hours for symptoms to appear.&#34;

He advised within &lt;15 minutes following the vaccine he sensed the left side of his neck was swelling.  He notified Immunization staff who brought him to the ER via w/c. He stated the ERMD did not perceive/palpate any swelling or nodules, and treated him with IV Benadryl with resolution of s/s.  He did not require any other doses of benadryl.    He received his 2nd Pfizer covid vaccine on 3/30/2021 lot#ER8734 to right deltoid.  He stated within 15 min again, he had the sensation of throat stiffness (as if muscles really tight/tensed) and this made it difficult to breath and caused his chest to hurt. He was taken to the ER again and given Benadryl again with resolution of symptoms. He was released later without any reoccurrence of symptoms. He states he went to work on 3/31 where he began to feel bad/achy-feverish.  Today he had a fever (not taken), total body aches but mostly to his left hand.  He reports feeling fatigue and unable to do normal AM routine of working out.  He could only stretch today.  He denies any trauma, recent illness, difficulty breathing, swallowing, eating, ha, n/v/d, or other symptoms.

                                                DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 1. Chest x-ray that was normal. 2. CT angiography of the chest showing no abnormalities. 3. Echocardiogram showing no significant abnormalities.  HOSPITAL COURSE: A 24-year-old male, primary care patient, received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination 3 days prior to admission.  Following this, he had a fever, chills, body aches, and then developed severe chest pain.  The pain was worse lying flat, better when sitting up and leaning forward and worse with a deep breath.  He had gone to an urgent Care and was recommended going to the emergency room.  The patient&#39;s troponins were elevated and his EKG was fairly classic for pericarditis.  He was felt to have probably viral myopericarditis and was admitted for observation.  He was placed on aspirin and colchicine.  He seems stable from Cardiology to be discharged on this regimen as well as symptomatic treatment.  It was not known whether the COVID vaccine was implicated with this or not.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: CONDITION:  Stable and improved.  MEDICATIONS: 1. Colchicine 0.6 mg b.i.d. 2. Aspirin 650 mg t.i.d. 3. Oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg every 4 hours p.r.n. for pain. 4. Zofran 4 mg sublingual q.8 hours p.r.n. for nausea.  DIET: Regular.  ACTIVITY: As tolerated.  FOLLOWUP: With Cardiology on May 3rd.  If worsened pain, shortness of breath, or high fever, return for evaluation sooner.  In which case, steroids may be administered.

A 24-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158; Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eye allergy. Concomitant medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AMOXICILINA CLAV) taken for eye allergy from 12Apr2021. On 14Apr2021, he received the first dose of the vaccine about an hour ago and waited five minutes and went to the bathroom. He had a severe reaction while patient was in the bathroom, he started to feel dizzy, had a terrible headache and chills. He walked out of the bathroom at the store and fell out completely in front of the pharmacists. The patient also experienced weak with shilling (as reported) and started sweating. The pharmacists called 911 and the responders checked his vitals and blood pressure and all of that and everything was fine. Patient clarified he passed out completely for almost 5 minutes. Patient stayed there with everyone until, they were waiting to see how he was doing. He reported he was feeling much better now, still feel a bit dizzy, not 100% but not as bad as when it happened. It has improved and he definitely felt terrible at the time. He was monitoring himself at home to see if he notices something weird going on. He does not have a headache right now and was feeling much better. When he was having the effect, he was mentally sharp, and knew what was going on. He thought about letting himself walk outside the bathroom so he could be seen. He didn&#39;t lose track of what was going on and body reacted adversely. He remembered stuff and everything and he felt good. Patient stated the chills went away; however, would not say they went away completely, he was recovering. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office and the paramedic said it was not necessary right now because all the vitals and everything else seemed fine. There was no therapy received for the events. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the vaccine and no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of events feeling dizzy, terrible headache, chills was recovering; still feeling very sick was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

                                                After receiving the Pfizer vaccine the patient had a small drop of blood. I grabbed a cotton swab and asked the patient to hold still. He said that he did not handle blood well. About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient stated that he was feeling like he needed to lay down. I laid him down in the booth area and obtained a BP 102/48, HR 43 normal cuff, supine position, left arm. Technician and I then elevated the patient&#39;s feet on a chair as the patient was appearing pale. Technician and I placed a ice pack on the back of the patient&#39;s neck as he was feeling hot/clammy. After about 15 minutes the patient was feeling much better and his blood pressure returned to normal - 108/55 HR 53, normal cuff, supine position, left arm. Patient stated that he was a avid cardio exerciser. The patient was then instructed to wait another 10 minutes and then he checked in before leaving and said he was feeling great.

                                                He states he had the first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the series on 4/13/2021.  He states that two days later on 4/15/2021 he felt like his feet were heavy.  He continues to experience that sensation in his feet, and even feeling like his feet are asleep at nighttime and when he first gets up in the morning.  The asleep feeling in the feet gets better when he gets up and moves around but the heavy sensation in the legs does not get better.  He states that his mobility is affected though that his legs feel heavy and he is not as easily mobile as he used to be. He feels his balance is off. Patient later reported that he did have and episode of syncope about 5 minutes after he got the vaccine but otherwise was doing okay until 4/15/2021.  He presented to the ED with these symptoms on 5/3/2021 at approximately 7:14pm and was admitted to the hospital for evaluation.  Patient states that he normally exercises regularly and has been having a great deal of difficulty especially with squatting and now has difficulty walking up stairs, feels very weak and his legs feel heavy.   He reports that the numbness and tingling sensation of his feet when sleeping is new and he has never had it in the past.  Symptoms get worse with exertion and prolonged activity.  Neurologist was consulted and several tests were ordered.  Neurology consult noted that patient had a prior COVID 19 infection in November 2020.  Per neurologist notes: His symptoms first started about two days after he received Pfizer COVID vaccine on April 13, 2021.  He recalled feeling his feet heaviness and it was hard to pick them up.  He also had some calf pain.  He also had difficulty with doing his stretches and yoga positioning.  A week ago, he began to have difficulty with picking up a ball or anything from the ground.  He also developed pins and needles at the fingertips at the same time he developed tingling sensation of his feet.  He also has lower back pain.  He tested positive for SARS-COV-2 antigen on November 12, 2020.  He recalled having symptoms lasting for a few days consisting of diaphoresis, cough, and flu-like symptoms.  Per neurologist, symptoms seem to resemble acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP).  Patient was treated with IVIG for 5 days.

Patient complains of midsternal chest pain that started approximately an hour ago.  He states that it woke him up from sleep.  Pain is sharp without any radiation or other associated symptoms including diaphoresis presyncopal symptoms or palpitations.  He denies any significant air hunger or shortness of breath.  He otherwise had been feeling better after what he tall was post COVID vaccine symptoms.  Patient received a 2nd dose of pfizer vaccine 3 days ago.  He states that within 24 hours he had symptoms of myalgia fever and feeling unwell.  That has been resolving patient has been feeling better until the chest pain today. Patient otherwise denies any other medical problems in.  He denies any history of drug use including any recent cocaine or other drug abuse.   Elevated cardiac enzymes and chest discomfort are likely secondary to myocarditis and secondary to vaccination/ inflammatory reaction.  Although there is low likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease as well.  I recommended cardiac catheterization for clarification.  He does not want to have the procedure done, understands the risk of undiagnosed coronary artery disease and risk of MI.  He would like to be discharged home.    I reviewed the images of echocardiogram and it seems that he has a small area of hypokinesis in infero basal segment.   Recommended to take aspirin and be seen in Cardiology office in 2 weeks.  Advised to abstain from exercise and significant physical activity till that time and return to the hospital if any symptoms.       Subjective:   I saw patient in consultation for evaluation of chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes.   Patient is a 24-year-old healthy male who had COVID-19 vaccination with his second Pfizer shot 4/14/21. He developed fever, chills, nausea and vomiting 1 day after vaccination.  He did not have any reaction to the 1st dose.   He presented to the hospital with substernal chest discomfort which woke him up from sleep, radiated to throat and had a throbbing feeling.  This lasted for 1 to 2 hours and subsided completely in the hospital.   He smokes 5 cigarettes a day, is physically very active and exercises regularly.  He is not on any medication at home.

                                                2 weeks after my second pfizer dose I experienced intense chest pains for ~4 straight days. The pain was located in my upper-left chest / peck area. With each inhalation I experienced significant pain (a 5 out of 10, at least). This lasted for several days and slowly went away. However, about 2 weeks later and again 3 weeks later I felt this pain again. I&#39;ve never had chest pain before. I am young, healthy, don&#39;t consume alcohol regularly, do not smoke, and I exercise often. I brushed off the chest pain as &#34;the human body is weird and does weird things&#34;. However, now seeing that myocarditis may be an apparent side-effect, I want to report this strange occurrence.

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  I experienced extreme chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath, painful heart beats, I could feel each beat. I hunched over in my bed groom grabbing my abdomen and fell onto my bed and almost passed out from whack I?d assume is lack of oxygen. I could barely breathe for about five minutes and felt relatively severe pain particularly in the right side of my chest. I could feel every muscle, tendon, and artery inflamed, enlarged, and hurting. My chest felt like it filled up with a balloon. Heart rate went up too. I have NEVER EVER felt ANYTHING like this in my LIFE. Not even close. It was a brand new sensation to me first time I?ve ever felt anything like this at all, and very intense and frustrating. Keeping in mind I am in perfect health. I am a body builder with a perfect physique. I work at a high end restaurant and have an extremely good diet. I have a normal sleep and sexual routine, I don?t use any medications whatsoever even Tylenol or ibuprofen. I have no pre existing conditions. I have no history of heart or cardio problems. My family has a history of low blood pressure. I have next to no stress or anxiety in my life. I am 24 years old I work out and run miles, five to six days a week. I don?t use nicotine, tobacco, and I haven?t had a drink of alcohol in ten years (14yrs old). I smoke marijuana on a daily basis. After about ten minutes the incident went down and I was able to breathe a little better but still had pain and tightness in my chest. I have had shortness of breath ever since. This is being written the day after the event about 26 hours later. I ran a mile last night and went to the gym it seemed to help both my breathing and the pain and tightness but it has not fully gone away. I feel my heart straining somehow as I am typing this. One thing to note is I did not want to get vaccinated but was pressured to do so, and before getting it I was very nervous and honestly upset. The woman administering it was not helpful at all and actually mocked my unsureness and was very rude and unprofessional. She didn?t answer any technical questions I had. During my interaction with her between my nerves and her behavior I?m absolutely certain my heart rate was elevated at the time of getting the shot. I have only had one shot. The episode of  myocarditis occurred two weeks after my first shot. Two days after my scheduled second shot, which I missed because of work and was going to reschedule before this occurred. I am not going to be getting the second shot. Will be following up with my primary care doctor as soon as possible. Haven?t had time.

                                                patient fainted immediately after for about 1 second, his head dropped but then he woke back up. right after the dose he began breathing quickly, so i instructed him to take his mask off and lay back if he needed. i grabbed him a water and took his blood pressure/hr. EMS was called, patient denied care. HIS BP WAS 104/73 AT 12:53 PM AND HIS hr WAS 72 BPM. I did notice some mild seizure like physical symptoms  as he woke up - arms and shoulders jerked a little for a few seconds. he said that the same, but worse, reaction happened after his first dose.

                                                Severe apneic episodes with sleep. I have no history of sleep apnea, BMI of 24, exercise regularly, no known snoring. The night after my first dose at around 23:00 while falling asleep I shortly after having been asleep would wake up gasping for air.  Attempting to fall back asleep I felt the need to consciously make myself breathe, and when I would fall asleep no more than 5-10 after I would wake up gasping for air. This continued on until around close to 03:00 on 1/7/21. When I finally fell asleep around 03:00 woke up gasping for air around 04:45 and never fell back asleep. The next two nights, 1/7/21 and 1/8/21 I would have trouble falling asleep because these same apneic episodes were happening until around 03:00. The night of 1/9/21 I had no issues sleeping, and have had no apnea since those three nights.  These apneic episodes were followed by extreme anxiety from being unable to sleep fully (I worried moreso about not falling asleep than the apnea). Heart rate when counted ranged for 70s-80s and my normal HR while sleeping is around low 50s.

                                                I had chest pains that felt like tightness of my chest.  Friends and family said it sounded like a heart attack (despite being only 25 years old).  It hurt to sit up or maneuver my chest/rib cage in any manner, for example, a sit up caused extreme pain.  The pain was consistent throughout the day.  After it began to dissipate, it was only reproducible when my chest/rib cage was moved or had pressure put onto it. Went to the doctor, diagnosed me with costochondritis.  Received an anti-inflammatory shot.  Reduced the pain.  From initial pain to full recovery was about 3 days (if memory serves correctly, VSafe should have the correct dates as I responded accurately there).  A slight discomfort in my chest did occur after my second shot, but nowhere near the same amount of discomfort.

At the time of patients fainting I was mixing up covid-19 vaccinations when the technicians said we need you to come out here because a patient is having a seizure, When arriving on the scene I found patient unconsious on the floor face down, while assessing the scene I noticed some blood on floor. I tried to look for any trauma, patient was breathing and I tried to awaken him. I told someone to call 911 and contact a store manager. Then all of a sudden he popped up and sat up like nothing happened. I then noticed the brusing on his nose and asked for an ice pack and a bottle of water. Patient knew his name, was coherent, and seemed to be fine. I stayed with patient until paramedics arrived. Paramedics did a thorough examination and everything checked out. Patient waited for parents to arrive instead of going with paramedics. Vaccinator stayed with patient till his parents arrived.

                                                Patient reported to clinic for Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination.  Patient did not indicate on questionnaire that he had experienced fainting or severe reactions from receiving vaccinations before. About 5 seconds after receiving vaccination patient said he would like to sit for just a minute.  The clinic had a designated waiting area about 25 feet away where patients sit for 15 minutes after receiving vaccination.  My technician and I agreed that patient should stay seated in the same chair he was receiving the vaccination in so we would be right next to him.  After 2-3 minutes I noticed the patient had his eyes closed and then his head began to nod and he started to slump down in the chair.  As I went to patient&#39;s side to stabilize him he pushed his chair backwards away from me about 5 feet which caused him to roll to the right side of the chair and fall off hitting his head on the floor. My technician immediately called 911 and EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes.  A bystander who was a nurse helped me roll him onto his back and we propped his legs up with 2 cushions.  We took his blood pressure and pulse. Patient regained consciousness in about 30 seconds and the EMTs cleared him to stand up after about 15 minutes.  After patient had recovered, patient&#39;s mother who was there with patient and other siblings stated that the whole family has fainting episodes when receiving vaccinations. I informed patient&#39;s mother and patient to please inform any future vaccinators of these fainting episodes so they can be prepared.

I checked and he had a pulse and was breathing and we called 911. I was able to yell at him and he regained consciousness and could tell me his name, date of birth and other info. He was able to grab my hand and squeeze. he said he he had been dehydrated and had had covid before. we gave him Gatorade and he felt better.  paramedics checked him out and said most likely a vasovagal response. pt refused transport to hospital. his mother came and got him and was going to monitor

Transported to urgent care for monitoring, and discharged in stable condition.  Provider conclusion is that patient experienced a vasovagal event secondary to injection.  Vaccine itself does not appear to have any correlation to the event, but given that patient was transferred to a higher level of care, will submit a VAERS report.

                                                On Wednesday April 14th I got my second vaccination shot. The following day I had a 103 F fever, body aches, chills, migraine, sore muscles, couldn&#39;t walk, excessive thirst. Those effects lasted all day and I felt better on Friday. Saturday night chest pain started along with sore arm getting worse. I took ibuprofen and melatonin to sleep. Woke up Sunday morning and pain came back and gradually got worse until I went into the ER around 9 am. They gave me Morphine to put the chest pain at bay. Then transferred me by ambulance to a different hospital with a cariology department. They treated me as if it was Myocarditis and also got an x-ray of my chest. The next morning I had an MRI and that is what confirmed it to be Myocarditis. I was then discharged with lots of medications to keep the inflammation down.

                                                The patient reported that they were experiencing tightness in their arm and believed it swelled initially. They left the pharmacy area and went to get Tylenol that was recommended by the pharmacist. They then began to get lightheaded and had syncope, attempted to get back up and the cashier asked to if they wanted to sit, but fell again. It was not clear initially to the employee who was helping them they had received the vaccine. 911 was called and the employee helping them let the pharmacist know they had just gotten their vaccine. The immunizing pharmacist went to check on the patient. EMTs were already helping the patient and had taken his blood pressure which was normal the lightheadedness had stopped and both sitting and standing blood pressure was the same. He had an elevated heart rate per the patient but didn&#39;t know any of the numbers the EMTs had taken. His father was driving him. He was not experiencing any symptoms and the injection site had no swelling and was otherwise unremarkable.

                                                We had a patient today that passed out after his covid vaccine.  It was his 2nd covid immunization.  He got his immunization at the pharmacy in the booth and then he sat down in one of the waiting chairs at the end of the cough and cold aisle.  While he was sitting down, he began to feel unwell, he then got up off his chair and then was approaching the drop off window (he was going to let us know he didn&#39;t feel well) at that time he then passed out.  He fell into the privacy screen of the imz booth.  He did fall into the booth which did break some of his fall.  He also knocked off one of the frames that we had on the wall, and then I think it fell on his nose.  He did get a cut nose and he also bit his lip or mouth because his mouth was bleeding also.  He reported that his nose did hurt, and he will have a prominent bruise on his nose.   We did provide him with a couple of ice packs and a bottle of water.   The patient (25 years old) and his mother both stated that he has passed out in the past when he has been around needles.  He stated that he got to thinking about getting the shot and the needle going into his arm and that is when he started to feel unwell.

                                                Ever since I got the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine, there&#39;s been something wrong with my heartbeat. It feels stronger, to the point where it keeps me up at night sometimes. At first it was subtle, and I thought it could have been indigestion (I have IBS which sometimes causes gastrointestinal distress), or anxiety. However, both of those conditions have been with me for many years, and this particular event began precisely when I got my first dose of the COVID19 vaccine - that night. The first time, it went away after a few days, but after my second dose, it came back (again, the same night the vaccine was administered) and hasn&#39;t gone away since. It&#39;s still subtle enough that I don&#39;t notice it during the day, but it&#39;s there quite clearly every single night now. I&#39;m getting used to it, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be causing any other health problems or adverse effects, but something has definitely changed.

Pt was instructed to wait an additional 30 minutes following his vaccination. Pt was given his vaccine at 1134. Pt reported a sensation of &#34;tongue swelling and chest tightness&#34; at 1139. Pt reported it felt like his past anaphylactic reaction. Pt voice sounded muffled, tongue appeared swollen. Pt self administered 1 adult Epi Pen at 1139 with x1 RN and x1 medic supervision. VS were taken. HR was 107, BP was 137/92, SpO2 was 97%. Lung sounds were clear in the apices and diminished in the bases bilaterally. Periorbital swelling was noted at 1140. 911 was called and an ambulance was dispatched at this time. The pt denied a feeling of nausea, denied dizziness. Pt was alert and oriented x4/4 for the entirety of observation. VS were taken again at 1144. The HR was 97, BP was 131/85, SpO2 was 97%. Last reported oral intake of a &#34;bagel and coffee at 0800&#34;. VS taken again at 1147, HR 101, BP 135/86, SpO2 98%. Pt reported a continued feeling of throat tightness, periorbital swelling was increasing. Ambulance arrived at 1154 and was given full report. Paramedic assumed care at 1155. Paramedic team deemed it safe to administer one more dose of epinephrine and transport patient via ambulance to ER. In ER, patient endorses mild chest tightness but denies any shortness of breath, oral pharyngeal edema, difficulty swallowing, wheezing, abdominal discomfort, nausea or vomiting, pruritus, or hives.  He was given Benadryl, methylprednisolone, and famotidine while in the emergency department to finish the allergic reaction cocktail.  He was observed for a total of 3 hours after his last epi injection and he remained HDS and asymptomatic.  He was given a prescription for EpiPen autoinjectors with multiple refills.

I hope you stop misleading the public and communicate that myocarditis and severe inflammation IS 100% A SIDE EFFECT THAT IS CAUSED BY THE VACCINE RESPONSE. I know because I am experiencing it, and you&#39;ve ruined the last 24 days of my life. Thank you.

                                                Pt is a 25M with PMH of GERD, ADHD, obesity who presented to the ED on 5/11 for chest pain. That morning he had noticed increased substernal chest pressure associated with palpitations, nausea, diaphoresis, and left arm tingling. He notes that early last year he was very sick and though he had COVID but confirmatory testing was not available at that time. After recovering from the illness he noted that he had occasionally episodes of chest pressure and palpitations. However yesterday was the worst his symptoms have ever been. He did receive his 2nd COVID vaccine this past Saturday and experienced fatigue, nausea, weakness.  In the ED patient has HD stable, afebrile, saturating well on RA. Labs were notable for troponin of 5.2 which trend down to 3.1. ESR WNL, CRP elevated 2.4. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with signs suggestive of possible pericarditis. CXR negative. CTA showed no pulmonary embolism, enlarged and prominent left axillary lymph nodes, nonspecific, cholelithiasis. Patient admitted for NSTEMI. Enlarged axillary lymph nodes likely reactive in the setting of recent COVID vaccine.    Cardiology consulted. Patient underwent cardiac cath which was unremarkable. Cardiology recommends short course NSAIDs for possible pericarditis, however EKG changes unimpressive per cardiology. Discharged home on ibuprofen 400 mg TID for 5 days. Advise follow up with PCP within 1 week.

                                                Patient developed sudden onset of fevers and malaise on 5/7/21 (26 days after his 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine).  His symptoms progressed to involve shortness of breath which prompted his admission to our Hospital on 5/12/21.  He rapidly deteriorated requiring intubation and ultimately placement on ECMO and temporary internal heart pump (Impella device) placement.  He was thought to have myocarditis due to elevated troponins at the time of admission and cardiac MRI showing wide spread myocardial inflammation suggestive of myocarditis.   He was treated with high dose steroids and supportive care due to the concern for cytokine storm and eventually started to show signs of improvement.   He was eventually taken off ECMO, internal heart pump and ventilatory support and went home after 20 days in the hospital.  However, follow up cardiac MRI revealed ongoing myocarditis, but his ejection fraction had improved.
