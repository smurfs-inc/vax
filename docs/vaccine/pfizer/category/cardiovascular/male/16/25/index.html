His mother gently lowered him to the ground (@ 1804). Patient&#39;s mother stated he just passed out and that this was his first injection ever in his life. Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient&#39;s legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling &#34;a star&#34; on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%. Immediately after the patient passed out the second time, his pulse was measured at 38 bpm and his lips displayed slight cyanosis. His pulse quickly rose to 52 bpm, within less than 10 seconds. One minute later his pulse was up to 68 bpm.

                                                High blood sugars for a week now.  My son is 16 year&#39;s old and was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in November.  He is thin and active, and an otherwise healthy teen and runner.  He is in his &#34;honeymoon phase&#34; of diabetes and I think the vaccine may be killing off beta cells.  He went from having blood sugar levels in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s at 12 units of Lantus to now 120&#39;s to 130&#39;s and up to 160&#39;s immediately after the shot.  His mealtime insulin is also not working at the same number of units and he&#39;s going in the 200&#39;s when he was around 160&#39;s before the shot. It has lasted now for a week instead of the 48 hours I was told about and read about.   As soon as we were leaving from getting his vaccine, he started experiencing extreme fatigue.  That night and for 2 days he had a headache.  He is still more tired than usual and having to take naps.

                                                vasovagal syncopal episode after receiving his first COVID vaccine.  Patient became nauseous and began to perspire.  He was able to respond to verbal commands, and never had complete LOC.  We were able to provide oral hydration and cold compresses.  After 15 mins I was able to have him sit in a chair, where he stated he was feeling much better.  After a total of 45 mins, he was able to walk out of clinic independently

                                                Patient was nervous upon receipt of vaccine.  It was an unscheduled (expiring) dose.  Per parent, he had fallen asleep outside vaccine room and they had to wake him up to get vaccine.   I gave immunization and asked him to stay for 15 minutes afterwards.  His Mom ran to consult window to notify staff patient was passing out.  I was sanitizing vaccine room so I immediately ran to him and his Dad and I caught him as he was slumping over.  He was shaking really hard, weak, and clammy.  He was coherent b/c I asked him his name but did not have clear recollection of timing of vaccine.  He was very pale in color.  His Mom grabbed him a Gatorade and he seemed very thirsty as he was drinking.  He mentioned he felt dizzy and that both arms were hurting and the arm I gave vaccine in felt like he had sweat dripping off it.  (I felt his arm and it did not).  I grabbed an instant cold pack and placed on his neck to help cool him off.  His color returned over the 30 minutes.  I asked parents if they wanted me to call ambulance but they wanted to wait and see how he responded.  He looked at his iPhone data and his heart rate had spiked.  Unclear if right before vaccine or right after but I believe he mentioned it went up to 120 when Mom said his normal resting heart rate was 60.  He ate some gold fish and seemed to perk up and have a few funny conversations showing his personality.  I explained to him very important to let parents know if he experienced any other side effects after leaving.  He was able to stand up and walk out of RX with parents.

After mom was vaccinated I had my bad to the patient and his mom throwing away supplies, Pt passed out and was not responsive to mom or to myself the pharmacist. I thought the patient needed an EpiPen and went to get the EpiPen out of the pharmacy and while my back was turned mom stated that the patient convulsed a few times. By the time I returned with the EpiPen pt was not convulsing and had passed out and started to recover and become responsive. Pt was pale but was aware of his name, birthday, date, and current president. A tech called EMS. Pt was talking when EMS arrived and color had started to return to normal. pt was able to walk out to the ambalance to be checked out. Mom stated she wanted to take pt to ER for more evaluation.

                                                Patient started to feel dizzy for about one minute. His father states that patient was sitting up on a chair and he started to fall backward, so his father caught him and lowered him to the ground. He did not hit his head. He was not responsive for approximately 10 seconds, per the father. Clinical monitors arrived and patient was alert and oriented to name, place, date/time. He was slightly pale and clammy but he denied any dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, headache, changes in his vision/hearing, or nausea.  He was laying on his back on the ground with his legs elevated on a chair and he started to feel better, and his blood pressure and oxygen saturation were stable with mild bradycardia per the vital signs obtained by one RN. He said he was feeling better and he was smiling and joking with staff. He slowly started to sit up and sipped bottled water. Stated that he had not eaten since 11am, and he agreed to a snack.  I left to get him a snack, and RN said that he started to &#34;zone out&#34; and he lost consciousness again for approximately 20 seconds. When I came back, he was sitting up, conscious, and had spit up saliva and water onto his shirt. His breathing was steady.   He again stated that he was feeling better very quickly, again in good spirits, but his father and I agreed that it would be best to call 911 to transport him to the ER just to be safe. He did not hit his head. He denied dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, changes in vision,  and headache. He was alert and oriented to name, place, and time. EMS was requested and they arrived, took his vitals, and he was transported to the Emergency Dept for futher care.   He and his father were confident that he would recover quickly as he had a history of syncopal episodes related to vaccines in the past.

                                                Pt was seated in the waiting area after receiving his first dose of covid 19. His parents who also received the vaccine were waiting with him. I was preparing another dose for patients waiting for their covid vaccination. I heard pounding on the clinic room and ran to check. The mom had knocked on the door because her son had fallen out of his chair.. when I arrived he was on the floor and his parents said he was regaining consciousness and moved him in to a seated position. At this point another customer was calling 911. I had my technician call management.  I observed the patient and asked if he was doing ok. His parents asked him if he was hurt and he responded in the negative. The patient was feeling cold and his hands were &#34;cold and clamy&#34; according to his mom so I held off on the cold compress. He wanted water but was also nauseous so I told the parents that I do not want to risk aspiration. We gave him a bag to throw up. I recommended that they take him to get seen when the paramedics arrived as I was concerned about him shaking before fainting. At this point the paramedics arrived and he was taken to the hospital as he was not feeling well. I followed up with the patient&#39;s mom and she said all his tests came back normal (EKG, et) and that the doctors may think it could have been due to anxiety from getting the vaccine. She was really appreciative of the call.

A 16-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 12:00 (at 16-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The caller is calling about her 16 year old son. She just left the doctor with her son who received his first Covid 19 vaccine. She would like to report an adverse event. Her son has had a fever of 105.2F (07Apr2021). The doctor just did blood tests, a rapid test for Covid that was negative, they tested him for strep throat that was negative and he doesn&#39;t have an ear infection. He&#39;s been running a fever over 105F for the past 2 days (07Apr2021). The caller wanted to rule out that nothing else is going on. They have called the Medical Director of (name)  and he didn&#39;t know what was going on with her son. If this fever continues she&#39;ll be calling Pfizer back. She is waiting on the results of his blood tests like his mononucleosis test pending and other viral and bacterial tests (unknown result). Her son started feeling bad about 4-5 days (unspecified date) after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. The last 2 days he&#39;s had a very high fever. He has a headache and body aches (unspecified date). He had a Covid 19 test not long before he received the Covid 19 vaccine and it was negative. She thought her son might have the Covid 19 virus but he had the rapid Covid 19 rapid test (09Apr2021) and it was negative. The caller does not know what is going on with her son. She took her son to a clinic because he was sick and because his fevers are too high. She also called the state but they told her that fevers are normal with the Covid 19 vaccine but if it persists after today, 09Apr2021, she needs to seek medical attention. It was further reported that earlier in the week her son told her he thought he was going to pass out at work (unspecified date). He told her he thought he had a fever but she checked it with a forehead thermometer and it didn&#39;t show a fever. Then on Wednesday, 07Apr2021, her son woke up around 4:30AM and had a fever of 105.2F with an oral thermometer. He woke Thursday, 08Apr2021 and this morning, Friday 09Apr2021 with a fever. His mother can control the fever during the day with Ibuprofen but he&#39;s spiking these fevers in the middle of the night. She knows fevers spike at night but she can&#39;t come with any other reason why this is happening. The patient lab tests and procedures also included CBC: pending, mononucleosis: pending, and rapid strep test: Negative; all from 09Apr2021. The outcome of events fever of 105.2f, headache, and body aches was not recovered; while for other events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                5 minutes after dose while standing and watching sister receive dose of vaccine, patient experienced presyncope.  Patient started to sway and lost muscle control.  I helped to the floor and laid him out.  Patient conscious whole time and never stopped breathing.  Did not lose cognizance.  Had momentary feeling of nausea that immediately passed.  Did not believe necessary to call 9-1-1 as patient did not exhibit any allergy symptoms of any distress during the whole episode.  Allowed to lay on floor for about 5-10 min.  Supplied patient with bottle of water to help with dry mouth and he drank and felt better.  After another 10 minutes patient was up on feet and feltmuch better.  Mother called an hour and a half later (about 5 min ago as I prepare this form) to inform me that he was back to 100%.

                                                Patient presents with a potential reaction to the COVID19 vaccine. I was called to the patient&#39;s vehicle just outside the vaccination area. The patient appeared to having a moderate to severe vasovagal episode without total syncope. There did appear to be slight pseudoseizure activity present, however, there was no LOC or loss of bowl or bladder tone. The patient was placed in a supine position and moved to the monitoring area. With positional changes and aggressive hydration, he rapidly improved to baseline. He did endorse that he has had similar episodes with blood draws, etc.  He was returned home with his mother as the driver and with preventative instructions for his second dose.

He said he didn?t say anything  until his eyes were black and couldn?t see then he said he didn?t feel so good.  The color drained from his body and he went limp.  Luckily a nearby paramedic caught him and he was wheeled to a recovery room to be monitored. Patient felt better after 15 Mins but it was so scary.  We didn?t expect any reactions as hes gotten all of his immunizations and never had any reactions.  I was really traumatized by this whole event.  The staff there were very nice and helpful and helped us ease thru his recovery.  I wanted to report this incident so that way you have a log of adverse side affects from getting the vaccine.  I hope the 2nd shot will be ok.... I?m very scared at this point. TBD

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after being administered with Pfizer COVID vaccine patient became lightheaded and almost fainted. Patient did not fall out of chair, but did slouch over in chair. The patient&#39;s father alerted pharmacy staff and the nurse administering vaccines today, and I went out to check on him. Patient was sitting up in chair at this time, but was very sweaty, pale and cloudy. Nurse instructed him to place his head down by his knees and provided him with water, Gatorade, and cold compresses. Once patient was feeling a little bit better we moved him into a private room with father and let him lay down at rest. When patient felt okay to leave he was advised to lay flat when he got home and eat. Father was also advised to stay with him until he was feeling 100%. Event lasted approximately 30 minutes.  A call was placed to parents around 3pm to check on him and he was doing well. (moving around and playing video games)

He got the shot, I filled out his card, and directed him and his mom to sit in the waiting area for 15 mins in case of dizziness or a reaction. They were walking out of the room to the waiting area and he almost immediately fainted. He fell and possibly hit his head on the chair/ floor when he went down. (This was maybe 2 mins post-injection). He almost looked like he was going to have a seizure (arms were tensed up, his eyes were not focused, was starting to shake) but then he suddenly came-to. He seemed to be pretty coherent after he woke back up but 911 was called since he was bleeding

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  Patient is a 16 year old boy with ADHD who presented with fever and myalgias for 3 days, that progressed to sharp parasternal chest pain and some SOB. Patient received second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 4/26, and after that shot experienced fever to 102 at home and myalgias. Subsequently his symptoms of chest pain have occurred. He underwent workup revealing of elevated Troponin, and EKG with some ST segment elevation, a slightly elevated CRP at 32, and a normal ECHO. Admitted for observation and concern for infectious myocarditis vs MIS-C. Cardiac MRI was done confirming Myocarditis, Troponin I was elevated and peaked at 23, 325pg/mL. Workup unrevealing of SARS. Other testing showed Resp virus panel negative, blood pcr for EBV, CMV, Parvovirus B19, enterovirus, and adenovirus all negative, HIV antigen/antibody testing negative. Patient treated with Ketorolac with steady improvement in symptoms over several hospital days. Discharged home 5/2 with Troponin I well down and symptoms resolved. Given reports in lay press regarding other cases of COVID-19 MRNA vaccine associated myocarditis, we are reporting this as a vaccine associated adverse event.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old young man presenting with chest pain admitted for myopericarditis.   He was in his usual state of good health until 2 days ago when he experienced fever, chills and myalgias after receiving his 2nd dose of COVID pfizer vaccine. He improved until 5/2 when he developed a crushing, non-radiating, substernal chest pain which was waxing and waning in nature without specific alleviating factors. He had shortness of breath, but no palpitation, dizziness, or changes in pain on exertion vs rest. Family activated EMS who gave 325 mg of aspirin en route to the ED.   In the ED, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was mildly diaphoretic, but otherwise, unremarkable on physical exam. STAT EKG showed ST elevations in V5 and V6 and ST depressions in V1 and V2 as well as PR depressions, which persisted on repeated EKG. Given concern for myopericarditis, they ordered labs including CBC, CMP, troponin and inflammatory markers which were only remarkable for troponin of 1.94 and CRP 3.5. Chest x-ray was normal.    Cardiology was consulted and they recommended transthoracic echo which is pending. Cards also recommended starting Ibuprofen 600 mg q8 hrs and admission to cards for further management.

                                                My son woke up with a upper backache in the middle of the night (5/3/21) and shortly after that he said that it felt like someone was squeezing his heart.  We called the pediatrician on call who recommended I take him to the ER.  At the ER, they performed two EKG&#39;s, a chest x-ray, bloodwork and an echocardiogram.  We were discharged from the ER 7 1/2 hours later with the following diagnoses: acute chest pain and acute pericarditis.  His treatment consists of taking 600 mg of Advil every eight hours for at least the next, laying low and not exerting himself for the next and following up with his primary care provider and seeing the pediatric cardiologist later this week.

As Medic approached, I helped patient to his feet and walked him over to a chair and sat him down, about 10 seconds after sitting him down he stated he was going to pass out, medic immediately braced patient and held him up and pt did go unconscious for about 15 seconds.  Pt quickly regained consciousness and was alert and oriented but still feeling light headed, he was helped to a wheel chair and taken to the cot area for eval.  Pt skins pale, cool, moist, pupils perrl, lungs clear bilaterally, vitals: BP 120/84, HR 52, RR16, SPO295%, pt asked if he has a slow heart rate and he declined, HR did return to normal at 82 BPM approximately 10 minutes later. PT kept on cot for 30 minutes, and felt much better after. Pt released to his father who stated that everyone in the family always passes out when they get shots.

He was standing up near the bleachers and an assistant initially brought a trash can over to him.  He was extremely pale and started to nod off as if he was going to pass out.  Chair placed so could sit down and instructed to breathe slowly and VSS obtained.  BP=122/70-98% spot oximeter-78 pulse.  He was able to drink some water and part of a cookie.

The following day his throat was sore and he had cough and chest tightness.  He took an albuterol  neb which relieved the cough and chest tightness.  I saw him in clinic on 5/7/21.  His COVID PCR was negative.  His lungs were clear.  My assessment is that most likely his symptoms were related to a respiratory virus or seasonal allergies triggering his underlying asthma.  I do not suspect that his symptoms were related to the vaccine.

                                                Child woke up at 3 am with severe nausea. Within minutes he complained about not being able to breathe. His lips turned blue and he was about to pass out. As I was able to keep him awake, I am not sure whether he would have had a febrile seizure (it very much looked like it) or just fainted. The fever spike was too fast, and his body couldn&#39;t handle it. His extreme nausea persisted for four hours (but he didn&#39;t vomit). He was completely debilitated.

                                                Patient received his 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine on Tuesday 4/27/2021; he had low grade fever (100.3 deg F) on Wed 4/28/2021. On Thursday 4/29/2021, he developed &#34;heartburn&#34;, and on Friday 4/30/2021 he developed chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

I personally reviewed the labs and CBC revealed an anemia at 10.830.5 hemoglobin hematocrit respectively.  Most notably a 9000 thrombocytopenia.  CMP essentially unremarkable.  INR 1.5 PTT normal.  I added on Lyme disease and tick-borne illness as well as a Monospot type and screen.   Patient did receive his 1st visor vaccine for COVID-19 on April 29, 2021.   IV was established in the emergency department in consultation made to Pediatric Oncology.     I spoke with pediatric oncology in regards to patient&#39;s history and present illness.  He does agree that the patient should in fact be transferred under the pediatric care but recommended under the general hospitalist service.  He did not advise to proceed with any active treatment in our emergency department such as gamma globulin, platelets or steroids.   Awaited call back from pediatric hospitalist and spoke with Dr.  She has agreed to accept the patient in transfer.

No additional bleeding after initial episode.   Called pediatrics advice line that night but didn&#39;t recieve a call back.  Called again the next morning and spoke with nurse, she advised keeping watch but did not recommend further evaluation unless there was another episode or any additional potential side effects.  She agreed that I should report as potential side effect as he has not had any nose bleeds for about 11 years prior to this.

                                                elevated cardiac enzymes; left ventricular damage; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 16-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as first dose, at single for covid-19 immunisation (At the age of 16-years). Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On unspecified date, the patient was with elevated cardiac enzymes and left ventricular damage followed by a dose of product. Physicians indicate it was directly correlated and the reported was asking for specific information on this topic as to reported tissue damage especially with the EUA update age range. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac enzymes with results elevated on unspecified date. Outcome for all the events was unknown.   Information about batch number and lot number is requested. Further information has been expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available and a close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events of elevated cardiac enzymes,left ventricular damage. The case will be reassessed once new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate

A 16-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 29Apr2021 15:30 at the age of 16 years old (Lot Number: E000167) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history, no known allergies. Concomitant medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination included vitamins nos (MULTIVITAMIN [VITAMINS NOS]), acetaminophen. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EN6208) intramuscular in Arm left on 07Apr2021 13:00 at the age of 16 years old for covid-19 immunisation.

His parent gave him one Advil. He tried to go back to sleep but came back an hour later saying it felt like his heart was being squeezed. The doctor on call recommended they go to the ER. At the ER, they performed 2 EKGs, bloodwork, chest X-ray and an echocardiogram on 02May2021. His diagnosis upon discharge: acute chest pain and acute pericarditis on 02May2021. His bloodwork showed an elevated white blood count on 02May2021. They were to follow up with the pediatric cardiologist later this week. This events happened three days after his receiving his 2nd Covid vaccine shot. The adverse events result in Emergency room department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse events included Two EKGs, bloodwork, chest X-ray and echocardiogram. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hadn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events cannot be excluded as the information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment.

                                                Immediately after injection Patient began to faint and clench his arms. His head tilted back and eyes were glazed over. Lips became pale and face was pale. He was clammy to the touch on the back of his neck. His blood sugar at the time of injection was 113. He had not eaten breakfast yet. This lasted about a minute or so. He was finally able to say that he felt ok, but asked what happened. This happened a second time about 4minutes after the first time. But didn&#39;t seem to last as long. I gave him some juice and saw that his blood sugar was dropping to 85. Then a few minutes later his blood sugar was at 62. He continued to drink the juice and had 3 4carb glucose tablets. He started to feel better about 15 minutes later. He states that he felt numbness in his hands and feet initially. All feelings returned and color to his face and lips. His blood sugar began to rise again and he was feeling better. No hives or rash was noted on his body and the injection site was normal.

No past drug history. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The patient experienced ST elevated with elevated troponins in the 1000s, concerning myocardial infarction vs myopericarditis, 36 hours of left chest pain radiates to left arm on 13May2021.  The course of events was as follows: Previously healthy 16 year old male complaining of 36 hours of left chest pain radiates to left arm. Had Pfizer vaccine dose #2 about one day prior to chest pain onset. Found to have ST elevated with elevated troponins in the 1000s, concerning myocardial infarction vs myopericarditis. Admitted to the Pediatric ICU for further management on 15May2021 7:00AM. The patient was hospitalized for the events, considered life threatening. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19: Sars-cov-2 test: negative on 15May2021 Nasal Swab. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events, treatment in process. The outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient developed chest pain and difficulty breathing when lying down; symptoms started at 7pm on 5/21/2021.  Seen in the emergency room at Hospital  for chest pain, found to have elevated troponin level of 11.6 ng/mL (normal &lt;0.05).  CT chest negative for pulmonary embolism.  Patient transferred to Medical Center.  Initial high sensitivity Troponin-T level 1224 ng/L (normal &lt;15), BNP 805 pg/mL (nl &lt;300).  EKG with diffuse ST segment changes.  Echocardiogram (5/23 AM) with normal systolic and diastolic function, LVEF 58%; no pericardial effusion, no pathologic valve regurgitation.  Patient admitted to telemetry monitoring bed (no arrhythmias noted during hospitalization). Patient treated initially with Ibuprofen 400 mg PO q6 hours and famotidine 20 mg PO q12 hours for presumed myopericarditis.  Workup sent for viral causes of myocarditis: Respiratory viral panel negative.  Infectious Myocarditis workup sent: CMV, Cocksakievirus A and B antibody, CMV IgG/IgM, Echovirus antibody, Infectious Mononucleosis Screen, Lyme C6 AB IgG/IgM, Mycoplasma IgG/IgM, Parvo IgG/IgM, Varicella IgG/IgM.   Follow-up echocardiogram on 5/23 (PM) and 5/24 (AM) demonstrated no change in LV systolic or diastolic function.   Cardiac enzymes, including high-sensitivity troponin T, CK and CKMB, were trended. Cardiac MRI was performed - preliminary results show evidence of myocarditis Lab Trends (earliest to most recent, as of 1 pm on 5/25/2021):  High sensitivity Troponin T: 1224, 732, 664, 1058, 1332, 1141  CKMB: 65.6, 41.6, 19.3, 11.4, 6.3, 3.2  Pro-NT-BNP: 803,493, 392, 293  CRP: 58.2, 32.8, 28.6, 14.9.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old male presenting to hospital as a transfer for chest pain and elevated Troponin levels concerning for myocarditis. Patient has otherwise been healthy. Two days ago he received his second dose of COVID vaccination. He initially felt fine, but later that day had some body aches. The next day he felt feverish off and on and had dull left upper sternal border chest pain intermittently. Today, he reports sharp 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, lightheadedness, sweating, chills, and intermittent non-productive cough. He presented to original hospital for evaluation. The patient admits to tactile warmth since Sunday with no documented temperatures. He recently received his second dose of Pfizer just before onset of these symptoms. He reports difficulty sleeping since Sunday, but no shortness of breath, rashes, syncope, nausea, or vomiting. He has not had any other recent illness, fevers, or known COVID-19 exposures. He denies any history of prior cardiac disease and there is no known family history of cardiac disease, arrhythmias, or sudden death in the child or adolescent period. He denies illicit or recreational drug use. In the ED, he was well appearing with pain now 1 out of 10. POC troponin was 16.8 ng/mL. He had labs pertinent for ESR 10, CRP 3.0, BNP 24. RP2 PCR was negative. UDS was negative except for opiates (s/p morphine). IV was placed and patient was started on IV fluids. EKG was obtained and showed questionable left atrial enlargement per ED read. Cardiology was consulted and performed Echocardiogram in the ED at bedside and was within normal limits. Cardiology resident team contacted for admission. Past Medical History: No major medical diagnoses Past Surgical History: Orchiopexy, T&amp;A Family History: No cardiac family history Social History: Lives at home with mother. Has two healthy siblings not living at home Immunizations: Up to date Medications: None Allergies: NKDA Etiology of likely myocarditis remains unclear at this time. In his age group, this would most likely represent a viral myocarditis. He would likely benefit from cardiac MRI during this admission for further evaluation of myocarditis. His EKG findings with his age group are unlikely to be secondary to myocardial infarct. No arrhythmias or heart block noted on EKG at time of admission or telemetry in ED. There is no family history of autoimmune disease or cardiac disease to suggest an autoimmune component or genetic etiology.

PCP directed him to be seen in the ED. Patient noted to have ST elevation on ECG with elevated cardiac enzymes (CKMB and troponin) thus was admitted to the PICU. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function. Troponin level increased further following admission, however CKMB started to trend down. Remained hemodynamically stable and did not require any significant interventions (IVIG, vasopressors, ECMO, steroids, etc). Chest pain resolved on admission to PICU.

Dull pain/pressure in his chest has been persistent the last few days since he started running for soccer, club soccer just started.  Rode a long intense mountain bike ride prior to the 2nd COVID-19 vaccine, no problems with that, that was 2 weeks after the first, 1 week before the 2nd shot.

                                                myocarditis; chest pain; shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. This physician reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 06May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was none.  Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took ceftriaxone and received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) for COVID-19 immunisation.  On 08May2021, the patient experienced myocarditis, chest pain and shortness of breath.  The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to the events.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test (nasal swab): negative on 09May2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with ibuprofen. The patient outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association a contributory  role of  BNT162B2 to the reported myocarditis, chest pain and shortness of breath cannot  be totally excluded.  Additional information is needed to  better assess the report.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021565275 same reporter/AEs/vaccine, different patient.

Then it recurred at 2.30 pm - pressure-like pain in the same area, which radiated to his left shoulder. There were no significant worsening or alleviating factors. No change in pain quality or intensity with position. No shortness of breath, near-syncope or syncope, no palpitations. Upon his second pain episode, he called his parents on video chat and they instructed him to take 81 mg of aspirin and the pain subsided after 30 minutes. His parents promptly took him to the urgent care where he was found to have ST elevation and elevated troponin. He was transferred to CICU for further management.   Admitted for myopericarditis with ST elevation and elevated troponin.  On motrin q8h ATC, 12 lead EKG and troponin levels q6h.  Underwent cardiac MRI on 5/20 which confirmed the diagnosis.

He refused to take Tylenol that day, unlike his 14 year sister who had the same symptoms. On Sunday morning (the 3rd day) he woke up &amp; told us he was having chest pain &amp; shortness of breath. His sister was doing fine. So I gave him Tylenol at 10am to try to reduce any inflammation &amp; he still had a fever of 100. About an hour later his fever had reduced to 99 but he was still having slight chest pain &amp; shortness of breath ... mainly if he walked or moved around. He didn?t want to get it checked out but I called our insurance &amp; they agreed that he should go to the ER for testing so we went there at around 3pm. He had testing done including EKG, chest X-ray &amp; COVID-19 test which all came back negative &amp; other lab tests that also came back negative.  They gave him some meds &amp; about 2 1/2 hours later diagnosed him with pleurisy.  He still was having slight chest pain &amp; shortness of breath when we left at 5:30pm but throughout the evening was getting better. We gave him Motrin before bed &amp; another Motrin this morning before school, even though he said he was feeling better.

Pain did not radiate,  he did not have any shortness of breath but pain with deep expiration. EKG performed in the ED showed diffuse ST elevations, and because of this patient underwent left heart catheterization.  Left heart catheterization performed showed normal coronary arteries, left ventricle dysfunction with apical hypokinesis and an estimated ejection fraction of 50%, elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 20-25 mmHg, and no evidence of aortic stenosis, insufficiency, dissection, aneurysm. . Initial troponin level elevated to 12.4, max troponin level of 31.3. Pediatric cardiology was consulted with recommendations to start ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. An echocardiogram was performed and showed mildly decreased longitudinal strain in the apex and inferior basal segments. Patient currently continued on ibuprofen 600 mg q6h, with improvement of troponin level.

                                                16 yo previously healthy with pleuritic chest pain, occurring a couple of days after receiving second covid vaccine (Pfizer).  Workup revealed mildly abnormal EKGs and elevated troponins.  Cardiology consulted and Echo showed no evidence of myocarditis and bright pericardium without effusion c/w acute idiopathic pericarditis.  He was started on several days of motrin and pepcid.  Cardiology will see him in the office in 1 week.   The cause of pericarditis may be related to recent covid vaccination - this has been increasing reported after mRNA vaccines and affects teens and adults, primarily males.  Prognosis is very good with rest and NSAIDs.  Strict RTED instructions provided.  Normal activity allowed but NO sports or strenuous activity until seen by Ped Cards.

A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15May2021 (Lot Number: EW0177, at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart murmur. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical Vaccine included 2 vaccines in Mar2021 (Caller said that her son had 2 vaccines in Mar2021 on his annual doctor visit, she did not have the names of the vaccines and then had a booster for the vaccine 4 weeks later. The booster was 14 days prior to receiving the Covid vaccine), and meningococcal vaccine on 01May2021 (at the age of 16-year-old, Caller said that it was a meningococcal vaccine. She thought there were 2 different meningococcal vaccines). Caller was a consumer that was calling on behalf of her son that received his first dose of the Covid-19 Vaccine. She said that she saw on the news recently that Pfizer was looking into reports that teenagers were developing heart issues after receiving the vaccine. The caller said that her son was 16 years old and received his first dose on 15May2021. The caller said that her son had a really small heart murmur. When they got home later that day after he received the vaccine on 15May2021, he said that he had chest pain. She said that he did not have a fever, but was very fatigued and very sluggish for a couple of days. She said that this had been on her mind since she saw it on the news. She was concerned if he should get the second dose on 05Jun2021 with his pediatrician. The caller also said that because he turned 16 in Mar2021, he recently had 2 other vaccines and he had a booster. So he had 3 shots prior to having the Covid-19 Vaccine. The caller said that he received the Covid-19 Vaccine after 14 days of receiving the booster. The caller said that the fatigue and feeling sluggish lasted a couple of days, but stated that he was still tired a lot. The caller said that her son also reported that he had a sore arm. She said that he noticed it a couple of hours after his vaccination and lasted about 3 days. He had completely recovered from the sore arm. The outcome of the event chest pain was unknown, of event fatigue was not recovered, of event sluggish was recovering, of the event sore arm was recovered on 18May2021.

In the first case, the patient fell on the carpet since he was standing. Paramedics attended, observed for 15 minutes and declared that he was doing alright and we took him to a physical examination after that and found everything was normal. After the second shot ensured the patient was sitting on the chair after the shot and he experienced a black out and recovered. In both instances, he complained of heart pain.

Approximately two minutes after calling 911 the patient basically snapped out of it, knew where he was, knew the date and the day of the week. EMS evaluated the patient and  the mother had informed the EMS that he had just got done mowing the lawn before his appointment , the weather here is extremely hot and humid so I don&#39;t know if related to that as well but wanted to provide all information known.

                                                16 year old male with no PMH who presented with chest pain. Initially on 6/10-6/11 had expected myalgias and headaches post vaccination similar to dose #1, but later 6/11 developed chest pain that made it impossible for him to sleep. It was waxing and waning but continued through 6/12 which after discussion with PMD ultimately led to referral into our facility for further evaluation. Received a dose of ibuprofen with marked symptomatic relief. No further medications given during his time, his chest pain had resolved after that ibuprofen dose and was at clinical baseline until discharge on 6/15. Prolonged hospital course was to arrange for cardiac MRI to be done for comparison. Otherwise had serial labs (documented below) which had trended in the right direction.

                                                16yo previously healthy male presenting with chest pain. He received second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday at 3p. That evening, he developed fevers, chills and had trouble sleeping. On Thursday, he began feeling heart palpitations and again slept. Overnight, he developed midline chest pain, and decided to present to the emergency room. His EKG showed elevated ST segments. Labs were remarkable for elevated troponin, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP; echo showed normal function but subtle hypokinesis of the apex. He was given morphine, Tylenol, Ketorolac, 1L NS, and possibly aspirin before being transferred to the ED.   In our ED, he had a reassuring exam, was no longer reporting chest pain. He had labs drawn which showed a white count to 15.3, normal H/H, Plt 152, ESR 12, CRP 10, and Trop T 1.14.   Aside from the above symptoms, he has been in his usual well state without viral symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, joint pain, or other symptoms. He has no past medical or surgical history. Immunizations are up to date. His social history is benign.  Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. An echocardiogram was performed which showed mild LV systolic dysfunction. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV q12h. He remained asymptomatic with no chest pain throughout his admission. He was transitioned over to PO steroids on 6/13 which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were trending down. Cardiac MRI showed an area of late gadolinium enhancement in the LV, with no abnormal function.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake including tolerance of PO steroid. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology to be arranged. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  - Prednisone  - Famotidine Patient was admitted for management of myocarditis thought to be due to his SARS-CoV2 vaccination. He received IVIG and steroids. He had multiple EKGs, echocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI. He showed improvement during his hospitalization. He will be followed closely by Cardiology who will advise return to exercise and repeat imaging needs.  **Please note that we do not have access to the vaccination records (lot, etc)**

                                                4 days after 2nd dose of vaccine patient had onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations. He did not tell his parents so evaluation was delayed. Shortness of breath and chest pain self resolved. He presented ~2 months later with persistent palpitations and was found to have a new diagnosis of frequent ventricular ectopic beats. 2 months post vaccination his inflammatory markers and troponin were negative and his echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function. However, the clinical history suggests the possibility of post-vaccine myocarditis. I am not positive whether he received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine but I believe it was Pfizer. I am also not 100% positive about the date of vaccination.

                                                The day following the second Pfizer shot the patient developed a fever to 101.5 that improved with Tylenol and did not recur.  On that same day he felt tingling in the hands and feet and reported a floating sensation.  This too resolved with resolution of fever.  On the third day after the shot he developed chest pain, difficulty taking a deep breath.  He woke up the following morning with nausea which resolved but the chest pain and a feeling that it was hard to take a deep breath worsened.  The pain was significant enough that he went to the ER.  In the ER, he was found to have an ECG consistent with acute pericarditis and his troponin was elevated (2.75, upper limits of normal 0.03).  He was started on IV Toradol and admitted to the hospital.  His troponin kept climbing so he was also given IVIG (80 gm).  The following morning his Troponin started coming down and he no longer was reporting any symptoms.

                                                Pain in the back of patient&#39;s right calf started after a flight on 6/2/2021.  We ended up in the ER on 6/7/2021.  There he was diagnosed per ultrasound with DVT or having a blood clot in a vein in his right calf.  He was prescribed Eliquis and counseled to follow up with his physician at home. Patient met with our family physician on 6/9/2021, the day we arrived home to follow-up.  After receiving the medical records Dr. advised us to file this report.  We understand that blood clots can happen on flights, but Dr. felt that this event was such an anomally for patient that it merited further reporting. Patient is a completely healthy 16 year old male who is an extremely active athlete who participates in basketball, track, cross-country and other physical activities daily.  For him to develop a blood clot after a 4 hour flight is an exceptional, unexpected event.  Dr. long term plan is to keep patient on Eliquis for 6 months, then take him off of the medicine and then run more blood tests after 2 weeks to fully investigate the incident.

                                                Patient was hospitalized on 6/11/2021 after presenting to the ER with a history of chest pain x 48 hours.  Labs showed an elevated troponin and an EKG was consistent with pericarditis/ myopericarditis.  On further questioning patient had received the second dose of his COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine 2 days prior to the onset of chest pain.  In the ER he was given a dose of ketorolac which relieved his chest pain.  An echo as done which showed normal left ventricular systolic function and no pericardial effusion.  He was admitted for further monitoring of his heart rhythm and to trend his troponin.  He remained in the hospital for ~ 48 hours and was discharged on 6/13.  His troponin was at its peak at his initial presentation and was 7,077.  It initially decreased in the first 3 hours, but had small increases in the first 24 hours of admission.  However, it had decreased to a low of 1575 at the time of discharge.  His CRP initially was 4.4 (normal &lt; 1 mg/dL) and decreased to 1.5 at discharge.  ESR was mildly elevated at 23 and decreased to 18 at discharge.  Chest pain had completely resolved within 12 hours of admission.  He was maintained on ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily.

Headache, mild aching in the arms and legs, lack of desire to eat, and extreme tiredness also. Inflammation of the lining of the heart was the primary side effect and very concerning.

Most symptoms were gone within 5 days.  Minor aches remain after 1 week.

                                                Exactly seven days after patient second vaccine, he boarded a 9:10AM flight, with his Dad and sister. Approximately 90 minutes into the flight, as patient watched a movie on his phone (which did not have a photosensitivity warning), he blacked out and doesn&#39;t remember anything else until after coming out of a seizure. What others saw, including his father (my husband), was a convulsing 16 year-old (nearly 6&#39; tall and 155 pounds), who was sitting just in front of him, between two strangers. My husband quickly realized what was happening and was totally surprised and struck with some fear, as we have NEVER seen a seizure in our family or in patient before (we have six biological children). The airline called for medical help; a doctor and some other professionals came. My husband had EMT training many years ago, so didn&#39;t hold patient body, but did work a few times to keep his head up (patient was seated), so as not to allow the airway to close. Patient sister (age 18) was across the aisle, alone, watching all of the commotion take place, not knowing what to do or how to help, in tears, but handling it with poise and independence. After about 2-3 minutes, the intense convulsing stopped, and his seizure became quieter but still had movement. His eyes were rolled back and he was foaming a bit at the mouth. He was still not responsive. This went on for about 4-5 minutes. Then he stopped. His dad and the doctor asked him basic questions like, &#34;who are you?&#34; &#34;how old are you?&#34; &#34;where are you?&#34; He couldn&#39;t answer any other those. Another 3-5 minutes past, and finally he was able to answer &#34;where are you?&#34; with &#34;I&#39;m right here.&#34; Slowly, he came back to his &#34;senses&#34; but of course, was very tired and had a horrible headache afterward. The doctor and my husband decided it was best to have the plane divert to another city  to get patient to a hospital as soon as possible. The three of them had to cancel their trip (work trip for my husband, which our 18- and 16-year-old children were accompanying him on for pleasure and travel). The Airlines was awesome about the whole thing. When the plane landed, they quickly escorted the three off the plane (patient walked slowly, then was put in a wheelchair when they got right off the plane). They were then transferred into an Ambulance and emergently sent to the Hospital. After several hours of waiting and testing, and patient not having any more seizure activity, his CT scan, blood tests, and chest x-ray were normal,  so he was discharged with the instruction to get an MRI with and without contrast upon arrival back home, and then to follow up with a Neurologist. He has been home nearly a week now and feels like himself. He has had the MRI, which came back normal (yay!), but we are waiting to see a Neurologist at hospital. The ONLY thing in patient life that had changed for him in the days, weeks, months preceding this super surprising event, was his Covid #2 Pfizer vaccine. That is why we, and our supportive doctor, are suspicious that this may have been the cause. We are a little nervous about whether or not more seizures will take place, or perhaps his body is done dealing with his probably strong reaction to the immunologic/inflammatory variable. Maybe altitude could have played in, along with the vaccine, and been the straws that broke the camel&#39;s back of other things maybe brewing? But we don&#39;t think so. patient has had NO health issues, other than an appendix out 3 years ago! Thanks for listening. We want this variable to you as a data point.

Patient was admitted for telemetry monitoring and cardiac evaluation. The echocardiogram showed normal heart function and no pericardial effusion.  Given the clinical description of his chest pain, the likely diagnosis was myopericarditis. Patient was initially prescribed scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories but this was subsequently discontinued as patient was chest pain-free.  Patient was started on colchicine. Serial EKGs were obtained which showed subtle changes but no pathologic findings. A repeat echocardiogram prior to discharge showed was normal.

Patient was getting restless and started asking to leave ~13 minutes after shot. I said ?no, we need to wait the full 15 minutes they recommend?. About on minute later, or ~14 minutes after shot, Patient said he felt like he was going to pass out. As I turned my head to look at him to began to slump towards me unconscious and I held him up by his shoulder and waved the paramedics over. He was unconscious with eyes closed for about 5 seconds and by the time the paramedics got there his eyes were fluttering, but he remained unresponsive for another ~10-15 seconds as they were calling his name, tapping his shoulder, and asking him questions. Then he finally came around and, while groggy, he was able to answer questions. He sat there a couple minutes talking to paramedics and they had wheelchair, but he said he could walk and got up slowly to walk slowly back to clinic area.

                                                My son began experiencing chest discomfort a few hours after he had received his 2nd dose.  The discomfort only increased with his anxiety and having difficulty breathing.  He also experienced his heart racing.  I took him to the facility the following afternoon - approximately 31 hours after the 2nd dose and the facility completed blood work, x-ray and EKG; I was to follow-up with a cardiologist and that was also completed with Dr. and another EKG was performed, followed by an ultrasound of his heart. I have not received the result of the ultrasound as it was just performed on 06/30/2021.

                                                Patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and fainted approximately  minute after the dose was given. The patient&#39;s eyes rolled back as he fell to the floor where it appears that he had a mini seizure. We called for a code white and immediately began emergency procedures. I held the patient while he was sitting upright and kept speaking to him until he regain consciousness approximately 1 minute after he had syncope.  The patient seemed very confused because he had asked the question &#34;where am I,&#34; as he opened his eyes. He slowly became more alert as time passed by and was aware of his surroundings within the next 2 minutes.  He then stated that he was hot and hungry and was given water (from me) and Gatorade from his mother at his request. It was not long after that that the patient fully recovered and was back to normal. I had them stay and observed him for at least 40 minutes just to make sure that he was ok. Statements were taken from a salaried member of management during this time.  There was no medication needed and none given during this incident. Plans were made with patient&#39;s mother for a follow up and our contact information was given incase they needed to contact us for anything at all. I will reach out to them in the next 1-2 days to see how the patient is progressing.

                                                is experiencing symptoms of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP), which consists of the inflammation of small blood vessels.; is experiencing symptoms of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP), which consists of the inflammation of small blood vessels.; About one week after the second Covid 19 vaccine the symptoms flared up again/Second dose: Henoch-Schonlein Purpura; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer or other non-healthcare professional (patient&#39;s father).   A 16-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection, batch/lot number: EW0179) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21May2021 (16-year-old at the time of vaccination) as dose 2, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing crohn&#39;s disease (only one in the family with Crohn&#39;s disease). Concomitant medication(s) included infliximab (REMICADE) taken for crohn&#39;s disease and somatropin (NUTROPIN) taken for blood growth hormone both the products from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient previously received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection, batch/lot number: EW0176) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 30Apr2021, as single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced Henoch-Schonlein Purpura, red blotches under his skin and blotches on his legs, vasculitis on his bowel, severe stomach pain and on his legs it looked like vasculitis. It was reported that on 21May2021 the patient received the second dose of vaccine and on an unspecified date in May2021 patient experienced symptoms of henoch-schonlein purpura (HSP), which consists of the inflammation of small blood vessels and one week after the dose of vaccine the symptoms of henoch-schonlein purpura flared up again and it can appear on the skin, intestines, joints and where small blood vessels started to leak. The reporter further stated that his son took the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine and developed Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) and stated as HSP is inflammation in the small blood vessels most commonly in children and it affects the skin, intestines and joints with leaking blood vessels. On his son&#39;s legs it looked like a vasculitis. His son had these red blotches under his skin. It didn&#39;t hurt. He also got vasculitis on his bowel. He had a colonoscopy to diagnosis the vasculitis on his bowel. His son was being treated with steroids. HSP was a chronic condition, and his son has been dealing with it from the last month. The doctor advised him to call Pfizer to report this information and to find out if there is data or any other complaints or notification for HSP from the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. He stated that patient does have other medical conditions as he had Crohn&#39;s disease and receives a Remicade infusion every 6 weeks, and he also takes Nutropin for growth hormones. When probing indication for receiving the Covid 19 vaccine he reports convenience because he would have to wear a mask here or there or answer if he&#39;s vaccinated or not vaccinated. He didn&#39;t decide to receive the Covid 19 vaccine in concerns of his health. He reported that patient never had a positive Covid 19 virus test, the PCR test or the Rapid test. The reporter thought that patient&#39;s symptoms began on or around 07May2021 after receiving the first Covid 19 vaccine and the symptoms subsided, and the doctor gave the ok to receive the second covid-19 vaccine. His symptoms did improve prior to the second Covid 19 vaccine. About one week after the second Covid 19 vaccine the symptoms flared up again. Now it&#39;s 23Jun2021 and he still has symptoms. He estimates his son was seen at the doctor on 04Jun2021 with a colonoscopy on 09Jun2021. The reporter also mentioned that If Pfizer reaches out to him he does have photographs of his son&#39;s legs he can share. He really does believe the HSP came from the Covid 19 vaccine, but that could be one in a million. He stated that he was not calling to discuss symptoms. On an unspecified date, the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test which result showed no abnormalities and urine analysis which result did showed blood which also indicates HSP, and on 09Jun2021 colonoscopy which result was unspecified. The outcome of all the events was not resolved.  Information on lot/batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

A 16-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0176) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Apr2021 as dose 1, single (age at vaccination: 16 years) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing crohn&#39;s disease. As far as family medical history, it was reported as none and father stated that his son is the only one in the family with Crohn&#39;s disease. Concomitant medication included ongoing infliximab (REMICADE) taken for crohn&#39;s disease and somatropin (NUTROPIN) taken as growth hormone, both started on unknown dates. The father stated that, after receiving the first dose of COVID vaccine, his son started developing symptoms Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) which consists of the inflammation of small blood vessels. The symptoms began on or around 07May2021. On his son&#39;s legs it looked like a vasculitis. His son had these red blotches under his skin. It did not hurt and he also got vasculitis on his bowel. The symptoms first showed up as blotches on his legs and severe stomach pain. The pain is what alerted him. He was seen at the doctor on 04Jun2021, with a colonoscopy on 09Jun2021. He had a colonoscopy to diagnose the vasculitis on his bowel. It was stated that, the patient also had blood work that showed no abnormalities and a urine sample that did show blood which also indicates HSP. His son was being treated with steroids (treated right now with Prednisone 20mg daily). HSP is a chronic condition and his son has been dealing with it for the last month. The symptoms subsided and the doctor gave the ok to receive the second Covid 19 vaccine. Father reported that his son never had a positive Covid 19 virus test, the PCR test or the Rapid test. Also the patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date. About one week after the second Covid 19 vaccine the symptoms flared up again. Now he still had symptoms. He did have photographs of his son&#39;s legs he could share. He really did believe the HSP came from the Covid 19 vaccine, but that could be one in a million. The outcome of the events: First dose: Henoch-Schonlein Purpura and red blotches under his skin/blotches on his legs was not recovered and the outcome was unknown for rest of the events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

My son in a panic yelled for me to come into the bathroom and he showed me his urine and it was bright red with clots (Gross Hematuria).  I know the time because as soon as I saw it I took a picture (of which I still have on my phone).  I proceeded to access how he was feeling and after he said he felt okay just scared-no pain or anything, I called his Pediatrician whose office instructed me to take him to the ER and that is what I did.  He was not rough housing, there was no trauma  and again no pain.  This has never happened before.

                                                Patient is a 16-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presents to the emergency department with concerns for chest pain and shortness of breath.  Patient had his second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine 3 days ago.  Initially after the dose he did experience some myalgias, fatigue, and a sore throat.  The symptoms lasted overnight and into the following day.  They then remitted.  Yesterday, patient was feeling well in the morning, however, in the evening he began to experience significant shortness of breath.  This shortness of breath along with some anterior throat and upper chest discomfort with deep respirations.  He denied any associated nausea, vomiting, or sweating.  With these symptoms he went to hospital.  There he was evaluated and a chest x-ray was performed.  Patient&#39;s chest x-ray did not show any concerning findings.  Patient was discharged in stable condition with albuterol and encouraged to follow-up with his primary care physician.   Today, patient&#39;s shortness of breath and chest pain returned.  He states that it is in the center of her chest with occasional radiation to his jaw.  He denies any associated nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.  His pain was initially severe in route to the emergency department, however, it has lessened and is now 4 out of 10 in severity.  Patient otherwise denies any other fevers, lightheadedness, change in vision, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or dysuria.  Medical Decision Making: Pt presented for chest pain.  EKG was given to me shortly after obtaining it.  This showed ST elevation inferiorly and laterally with possible reciprocal change in I, aVL &amp; V1.  Troponin was markedly elevated.  I discussed case with our interventional cardiologist initially who wanted to take pt to the cath lab.  However, pt is a minor and he noted that he couldn&#39;t cath a minor.  This decision was made after the patient was already in the cath lab.  Therefore, I contacted Hospital and discussed this case with the on call cardiologist.  He recommended pt be tranferred to the ED where they will evaluate him and possibly do an echo of his heart.  I discussed this with the ED physician at hospital who agreed to see pt.  He was then tranferred via ambulance for further care.

His chin was pinned to his chest, he struggled to breath and was making a sound as if he was loudly snoring but seemed to be struggling to breathe. I was unable to wake him. I&#39;m not sure how long it lasted but maybe 2 minutes or so. He woke up and asked what was going on as we had all been standing over him trying to unsuccessfully wake him.  He shared that he thought he&#39;d been asleep and had been dreaming. He also shared that his throat hurt very much. He had the shakes for about 30 minutes after and was extremely exhausted. He slept for 14 hours as soon as we arrived home.

                                                Shot given around 1125 am.  Pt and pt&#39;s mother went to sit in front of pharmacy.  At around 1135, pt fell out of chair, sounded/looked like he may have hit his head on blood pressure machine that he was sitting near.  We thought he had fainted.  Pt woke within 10 or so seconds after fall and was confused.  Said his head didn&#39;t hurt.  His skin did lose it&#39;s color and he was looking &#34;white as a sheet&#34;.  We had pt lie on floor and elevated his feet.  After a few minutes he was feeling better and was able to sit in a chair.   Pt and his mom left the pharmacy area about 15-20 minutes after pt fainted.  Upon looking at video of the event,  it appears that before the patient fell out of his chair that his right arm raises up and his elbow is bent in a very stiff way.  A split second later his whole body appears to stiffen and bend to the left, then he falls out of the chair and is lying on the floor.  When on the floor, his legs appear to be fairly stiff as well.  This whole episode seems to last about 10 seconds or less.  The video makes it look more like a seizure than a case of syncope.

Provided the patient with a cold pack for the back of his neck and water to drink, and encouraged him to sit with his head lowered. The patient&#39;s father pointed out that he had not had anything to eat that morning, which could have contributed to his response. After a few minutes, most of the symptoms abated, and patient was feeling much better. His father left the store with him at that time. Called the father later that day, and he said patient was feeling better. Had taken nap and was only feeling a little tired. I explained possible side effects from vaccine and father thanked me for our time and concern.

Two days later the cough went away, at the end when it left (four days after my first shot of the Pfizer biotech vaccine) every time I sneeze there is either snot and blood or just blood.  And it has not stopped two weeks later. And I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m experiencing Brain fog however I do feel a bit slow in my mind not lethargic in my physical body.

                                                17-year-old male who presents with 8 days of headache.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 4/21.  He felt like he had the flu after getting the vaccine and developed right-sided neck pain and a temperature to 100.  The patient did endorse being elbowed in the neck playing basketball during this time as well, as he played in a basketball tournament in right after this.  He got his Covid vaccine in his right deltoid.  He saw his pediatrician on 4/26 and a CT scan of his neck with IV contrast was done and this showed significant diffuse right-sided deep spatial neck edema and right-sided adenopathy.  The pediatrician discussed the findings with ENT who recommended augmentin and a medrol dosepak.  The patient developed a headache several days after this and went to urgent care for evaluation.  There was concern that the augmentin and steroids had caused the headache, so the steroids were stopped and he was switched to keflex on 4/30.  He was given phenergan and toradol at Urgent Care and discharged home.  His mom notes that several days ago he had fevers of 101-104.  He has not had a fever for several days now.  His headache continued and he felt unwell at basketball practice so he returned to urgent care on 5/4.  A CT scan of his head was done which showed right sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis as well as thrombophlebitis of the right IJ. He was sent to ED for further management at that time.  In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable and well-appearing.  The CTs were overread by our radiologists here.  The patient had some labs done at the outside urgent care but PT/PTT/INR and a CRP were drawn here, which were unremarkable.  A Covid PCR is negative.  Neurosurgery, neurology, and hematology were consulted.  Neurology recommended heparin and a hypercoagulable workup and hematology agreed with this plan.  The patient was admitted to the ICU for neuro checks and monitoring during initiation of heparin.

We took his blood pressure twice and his heart rate was 105 bpm..  Can not exactly remember blood pressure (seemed very off).  Took pt to the hospital where they measured his heart rate at 107 bpm.

Symptoms included body aches, runny nose and general malaise. However, over the last few days he has felt worse and developed more congestion, cough, and sweating. He did improve a little bit 2 days ago but then started to feel worse yesterday and had a worsening cough that is resulting in some chest tightness. Cough is productive sounding. Mom describes it as barking. No appreciable wheezing but he sounds hoarse. He has some SOB after coughing repeatedly. He states it simply feels like it is hard to breathe for 10-20minutes after a coughing attack but then it resolves. He developed sweating yesterday as well. He states he will just start sweating for no reason. No measured fever. No chills. Today he has dried skin and cracked lips from blowing/wiping his nose all the time. No fevers. No vomiting.

                                                Patient was the 4th person to receive today?s vaccine of Pfizer. This was his second dose. He did fine the first dose. Patient sat down in the chair and rolled sleeve up. Chose L deltoid for injection site. He was talking with a friend and writer gave injection. Placed band aid. Patient was quiet and looked like he was going to get up but fell forward out of the chair. He hit his L forehead on side of wall. Writer caught patient and sat him up on the ground. Eye?s were dilated, he was diaphoretic, zoned out and not responding initially to voice, but eyes were open. Eventually got patient up to a wheelchair and taken to office area to lay down and monitor. Father was notified and sat with us after he arrived at the school. Patient drank 1 full 120cc orange juice and approximately 6oz of water. Throughout monitoring patient gradually felt better. Pupils corrected to normal, wasn?t diaphoretic anymore, and vitals improved. He stated this has happened before with lab draws and shots, but not this severe. Writer and colleagues informed him to notify people that are going to give him shots or lab draws about his history. Also informed him to notify his teachers if he feels anything out the ordinary for the rest of the day. Make sure he hydrates. Patient then sat up and walked in the room. He stated he felt fine like before getting the shot. Patient left stable and under his own power.

                                                Intense headaches the day after taking the shot, back pain from the waist up. 2 days later I woke up with chest pain and the lingering headache, my chest feels heavy and maybe shortness of breath. I did a bunch of research however I did not find anything about chest pain related to the second dose of Pfizer. I am not sure if it is some type of tissue or muscle pain or something more serious. When I massage my chest it does not ache like the muscle pain from my shoulder so id assume it has to do with maybe my lungs or heart.

                                                came to see me 3 days after his first Pfizer Covid vaccine and had been having a subjective fever, bad headache and stomach ache since the day the vaccine was administered. He incidentally had some weight loss noted at the visit over the previous 6 months for which I did some lab work. The lab work was normal except for his platelet count which was 111,000. A repeat platelet count done a week later was normal at 273,000. Because of the transient decrease in platelet count and the 3 days of bad headache after the vaccine, I decided to hold off on  getting a second Covid vaccine. Additionally and possibly of no significance, his mother apparently had a history of ITP during her childhood.

                                                17-year old M with history of recurrent ear infections requiring PE tube placement who was in his usual state of health until 5/5 when he noticed a new itchy hive-like rash. He was short of breath 5/6, and developed fevers that night along with vomiting. He was seen 5/6 with negative COVID19 PCR and documented fever to 104. Fevers continued, and he was admitted the evening of 5/10 with concern for myocarditis. See below for hospital course. Additional information for Item 18: ...Screening labs were notable for mild lymphopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and elevated inflammatory markers.  Given prior COVID infection, rash, and systemic inflammation, additional studies including troponin, D-dimer, BNP, and EKG were obtained.  EKG was reassuringly normal, however the D-dimer (2.48), troponin (1.27), and BNP (469) were elevated.  Other work-up included chest x-ray which was unremarkable, and right upper quadrant ultrasound with incidental cavernous hemangioma of the liver.  He was started on milrinone (5/11-5/12) after initial TTE was concerning for severely diminished LV function. Follow-up TTE 12 hours later was normal (on milrinone), and remained so after milrinone was discontinued 5/12. Follow-up TTE after discontinuation remained normal. Cardiac MRI was completed 5/14, although read remains pending. He received IVIG on 5/11, and was started on methylpred 50 mg IV BID, Anakinra 100 mg SQ BID 5/14,  and transitioned to prednisone 30 mg PO BID with clinical improvement, down-trending troponin and systemic inflammatory labs.  Subsequent CBCs have been notable for rising leukocytosis (5/16 WBC 56.3) and thrombocytosis (5/16 plts 690) and 4&#43; spherocytes (with no known personal or prior history of spherocytosis). He will likely be discharged 5/17.   Infectious evaluation was unrevealing including cultures and viral studies. COVID spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were sent, but remain pending. Pt. initial COVID-19 infection was diagnosed October 2020, with positive saliva PCR testing.  He was symptomatic for 3-5 days.  He received his second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine 4/27 in his left arm; denies any significant reactions (arm swelling, injection site redness, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, fatigue, or fever). He has had passing contact with school classmates who have recently been diagnosed with COVID19.

Pt states he has had 1 day of sudden onset L shoulder pain and chest pain. Endorses dyspnea due to pain with deep breaths, denies tachypnea, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. Endorses mild chills and aches after COVID vaccine 3 days prior to onset of symptoms, denies any fever, URI symptoms, diarrhea, rash, known COVID contacts. Pain continued to worsen and spread across his chest, causing presentation to ED this afternoon. No history of PE, DVT, long travel, recent surgery, malignancy, alcohol or cocaine use. Significant cardiac history in family: dad with CAD w/LAD blockage, both parents with hypertension.    At ED, labs notable for elevated troponin 0.456, repeat 0.67 and diffuse ST elevations on EKG concerning for pericarditis. COVID neg, CXR unremarkable, blood cx drawn, no abx started. Patient was given toradol for pain with minimal improvement. Peds cardiology was consulted and patient was transferred to different ED for further care.   At different ED, repeat EKG showed similar diffuse ST elevations in I, II, aVL. Repeat troponins uptrending (4.91), proBNP 562, ESR 43, CRP 18. Mildly tachycardic but otherwise hemodynamically stable. Given tylenol for pain. Cardiology recommended admission for trending troponins, echo and cardiac monitoring.  CV: Troponins were trended every 12 hours with a max of 4.91.  His last troponin checked on the morning of discharge was 0.41.  He had an echo that showed normal cardiac function, an MRI that indicated normal ventricular size and function, with minimal or healing and inflammation or mild myocarditis.  During his admission, he had continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, that did not show any arrhythmias.   Resp: On 2L NC for comfort, no respiratory distress or hypoxia.   FENGI: Regular diet   Neuro: Ibuprofen scheduled and tylenol PRN for pain.  He was initially started on ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, but was starting to have pain prior to being due for medicine every 8 hours so his regimen was changed to 600 mg every 6 hours which controlled his pain adequately.   ID: Myocarditis panel sent with some results still pending.  Thus far, he is CMV negative, EBV IgG was positive but not IgM.  RVP was negative.  This all occurred in the setting receiving the Covid vaccine 3 days prior to presentation, which has been reported as a rare reaction to the Covid vaccine.  At the time of discharge, labs pending results include mycoplasma pneumonia, coxsackie, parvovirus, enterovirus. Etiology of myocarditis remains unclear at this time, could be related to infectious etiology not yet clear to us, vs related to his COVID vaccine prior to admission.

Diaphragm movements when breathing increased severity of pain. Symptoms subsided within 12 hours with use of Kwan Loong Pain Relieving Oil. Unlike heartburn, nothing worked to relieve pain immediately. This was in addition to known side-effects that were present including: fatigue, slight fever, headache, muscle pain, and soreness at injection site.

                                                Patient fainted (loss consciousness) a couple of minutes after receiving injection. Mom caught him and called for help and reported his eyeballs rolled up and he started down when she caught him. by time Pharmacist and store staff got there (less than a minute) he had regained consciousness but very lightheaded. No breathing difficulty. So got a chair and had him sit with head down and store staff observing. After another 10min he still reported lightheaded and nausea, so ambulance was called. When they arrived and checked him out everything checked out normal and he was feeling better so they released him to his parents care. Called on 5/24/21 at 10:10am and spoke to mom who reported he was doing fine and no apparent after effects.

Immediately fooling the administration of the vaccine patients eyes glazed over and he fainted.  A few seconds later he began to have a spastic seizure that was short in nature, followed by a voiding of his bladder before he regained consciousness.  Patient was given water, glucose tablets, and instructed to lay on the floor of the room with his feet elevated while a member of the staff stayed with him to treat and watch him.   Followed up with patient and doctor soon after to learn this was the only time it has happened, patient fully recovered.

                                                Patient received 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine on 5/21/21. He had fever and headache for about 24-36 hours, which he had also had after the first dose of the vaccine. On 5/23, he woke up with constant substernal chest pain, which worsened with exertion and deep inspiration. The pain increased throughout the day. In the ED, he was found to have elevated troponin ,CK-MB,  elevated CPK, and elevated liver enzymes. EKG was concerning for ST elevation initially.  Bedside echocardiogram showed low-normal function, normal coronaries, trace effusion, and no evidence of RV strain. Troponin and NT pro BNP were increased upon admission to our facility. Repeat ECHO showed borderline global hypokinesis of the LV with an LVEF of 51%. He received IVIG on 5/24/21 and also was started on ketorolac on 5/24/21. Troponin and CK were trending downwards at the time of this submission.

                                                Patient received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 5/7/21. On 5/13/21 he began to feel feverish (unsure Tmax, never took temperature) and was intermittently febrile until hospital admission on 5/20/21. On 5/18/21 he was seen in the ED for fever and tested positive for strep throat and started on amoxicillin. His inflammatory labs were elevated at this time and did not notice improvement on amoxicillin. He returned to the ED on 5/20/21 at which time patient reported headaches on the right side, sharp 7/10 pain which come and go with the fevers as well as fatigue, muscle/body aches, and sweats in addition to persistent fever. He also noticed maculopapular rash on palms and soles and on distal extremities which was not pruritic or painful on day of hospital admission. All infectious workup was negative and patient did not improve on broad spectrum antibiotics. Given his persistent fever, hypotension, and inflammatory labs without other cause, patient was empirically treated for MIS-C and was given IVIG and methylprednisolone as well as being started on prophylactic dose enoxaparin for his elevated D-dimer. Repeat echocardiogram identified a new coronary aneurysm, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. Following IVIG and steroids patient remained afebrile and inflammatory markers down trended, however liver enzymes remained elevated at time of discharge. He improved and was discharged to finish steroid course at home with close follow up.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine in the morning, then woke at about midnight. He went to get a drink of water, and was holding a glass of water in his hand. He started to feel as if the room was spinning, became very sweaty, had ringing in both ears, and lost consciousness, striking his head on the counter. The event was unwitnessed. He reports waking approximately 1 hour later with a bad headache. He had a headache and felt disoriented. He denies urinary/bowel incontinence or tongue biting. He was able to walk back to his room without difficulty, took ibuprofen, and went back to sleep. He woke the next morning with nausea and vomited, but this did not impact his headache. He has not had any notable neurologic symptoms since that time, but continues to have a minor headache. He has not had any further vomiting. Headache has not subsequently woken him from sleep and does not worsen with recumbent positioning. He denies visual changes, memory changes, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, ringing in his ears, or dizziness. He says his headache is located mostly around his forehead and at the top of his head that is now mild and feels like pressure ?like a tension type headache.? His mother is a nurse, and evaluated him the next day. The family did not feel that he needed to be seen in the emergency department, or prior to this visit. He has not had any previous episodes that were similar. Patient was evaluated in my clinic. Complete neurologic exam was within normal limits. He has been referred to neurology for further assessment.

                                                Patient evaluated at local hospital for concern for meningitis / encephalitis, transferred to our facility and was able to get studies (detailed below some of which are still pending).   Initial symptoms presented with rhinorrhea, then severee headache, neck pain, and fever (tactile). Had sweats and chills. Began to experience diarrhea, dysuria, diffue body aches and myalgias. Severe pain in his neck / posterior occiput. Denied any mental status changes at the time.   Studies largely negative for an identifiable bacterial process so presumptive diagnosis is aseptic meningitis. Unclear if from vaccine or other etiologies. Outside hospital had started antibiotics but this was stopped and patient symptomatically recovered with only symptomatic care.

                                                myocarditis; myocarditis; chest pain; shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. This physician reported similar events for two patients. This is the second of two reports. A 17-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 01May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single dose (at the age of 17-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included myocarditis from 2019 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient admitted to hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath, diagnosed with myocarditis on 05May2021. The patient was hospitalized for 6 days. Treatment received for the adverse events include metoprolol, amiodarone, ketorolac, IVIG. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 05May2021. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events were considered as serious (hospitalization).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Myocarditis is not uncommon disease in young population.  This 17-year-old male patient had medical history of myocarditis from 2019.  Based on information available, the reported recurrence of myocarditis with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath was not considered as causally related to the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

The next morning he had a fever of 103, and gave her Tylenol chewable.  The following day he has no fever, in the early at 4:00 AM he woke up with pain on his chest.  He said that he felt weird, tightness on his chest and he could not actually describe it, said it was in the middle of his chest.  It was uncomfortable but uncomfortable and was worried.  They observed him, the pain didn&#39;t go away, just on the chest.  If he tried to sit up he felt better, but when he laid down the pain was always there.  Around 3:00 PM she brought him to the ER and had tests run, and all tests were okay.  His EKG showed ST-elevations and inflammation of the heart.  He had an US of the heart and was discharged home this morning.  He has to be seen by his PCP to be referred to a cardiologist.  He was given some medications and is sleeping right now.  He has an APT with his PCP on 6/9/21.   He was sent home to take Ibuprofen.

                                                On Monday, May 31, 2021 at 1:20am pt. woke up with intense chest pain and labored breathing.  He was able to fall back to sleep and woke up two hours later (3am) with the pain escalating.  He did fall back to sleep again and once again woke up at 9am only to learn the pain was even worse and was barely able to breathe.  He called me, his mother, and I raced him home and straight to our local Emergency Room.  The ER originally thought it was a collapsed lung.  After the x-ray came back negative for a pneumothorax, they continued testing.  The very last test they did showed extremely elevated Troponin numbers at 1.05 and C-reactive Protein (CRP) numbers at 5.42.  We were transferred by EMS/ambulance to the hospital 40 minutes away and checked into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Pt was admitted in the afternoon of May 31st and was released on June 3rd at 1:30pm.  June 1st his Troponin was 0.26 and CRP was 6.10.  June 2nd Troponin was .45 and CRP was 3.54.  The day he was released from the PICU (June 3rd ), his Troponin was .45, and the CRP was down to  1.83.  Pt received daily EKGs, 24-hour heart monitoring, constant blood pressure tests, as well as blood oxygen levels.  Once released from the hospital, Pt will be on light duty for at least a week, if not more.  First follow-up Cardiologist appointment was June 8th at 10:30am.  Echocardiogram, EKG, and blood work was ?normal.? Pt was put on a 72 hour heart monitor on June 8th and will be removed June 11th.  Will start weaning off Ibuprofen and acid reducer, Pantoprazole, the next three weeks.  Will continue to take Colchicine for three months, as well as light movement and exercise, nothing strenuous (swimming, running, etc.).  Follow-up with cardiologist in one month (beginning of July).

A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 21May2021 (Lot Number: EW0618) (at the age of 17 years old) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No reported family medical history relevant to adverse events (AE), no reported cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction (MI) under 50, no early deaths, nor any pertinent history. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0619) on Apr2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced myocardial injury on 23May2021, 2 days after he received his second Covid vaccine with possible association. It was stated that the patient came in to the emergency room (ER) about 28 hours after his second vaccine with sudden chest pain that woke him up and got worse. Further stated that the patient was seen at an outside emergency department (ED) and had elevated troponins, creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK MB), electrocardiogram (EKG) showed ST segment elevation, Echo showed trivial effusion, normal coronaries, and low to normal function. It was reported that he was admitted for monitoring due to potentially decompensating. Stated that he was consulted because of the association with the vaccine, and viral testing was done; the patient was tested for enterovirus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), epstein-barr virus (EBV), and parvovirus, all were negative. Treatment received was intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), pain medication and general support. States that the patient did receive IVIG while he was there, a one time dose, because the cardiologist was concerned with the way his troponins were trending, no decompensation. Further stated that the patient did not receive any pressors at any point and that the patient was still in the hospital but he was being transferred to the floor and they were trending labs, but he was not on any pressors or anything and he seemed like he has been doing well. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Chest pain and myocardial injury required a visit to Emergency Room on 23May2021. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No or unknown AE following prior vaccinations. As per the reporter all events seriousness criteria reported as medically significant, hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized from 24May2021 and ongoing at the time of the report (also reported as 2 days and counting). The outcome of all the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based solely on chronological connection to the vaccine causality between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 24 hours  after secondPfizer dose, 17 year old male awoke in the morning and was complaining of intense throat pain radiating into the upper chest  relieved by sitting up.  NSAIDS not helpful, went to narcotic med to relieve, which it did with single tab of medication.  Other symptoms, fatigue, body aches, low fever.  Waxed and waned over 48 hour time period from onset, with another intense episode  of throat/chest pain 24 hours in from onset requiring narcotic pain med to relief.   Again this was in the morning.  One episode of vomiting during second intense period with what looked like water that just hadn&#39;t gone down his throat, and following this he reported some relief from what he described as a radiating burning sensation up under the lower jaw and radiating into the upper chest.  No shortness of breath ever.   Burning sensation in throat and chest resolved by 72 hours with no more episodes of the acute throat and chest pain after the two episodes.  While ED was considered due to the distress being experienced, we decided against since the narcotic med was helping and no shortness of breath was being experienced.  I did try to get on with the CDC to report my concerns when it was happening to see if others were reporting this, then because it was a concerning reaction, but site was difficult to navigate and I was trying to monitor.  I did not call the pediatrician at that time as I am a health care worker and felt I could assess and make decisions based on findings.   Following the recent reports of myocarditis in teens, especially males, I felt obligated to report this experience.   This child has no history of heart ailment.  No tests were done to assess what might have been the cause.  I assumed it was an outside-the-box reaction to the second Pfizer dose.

I took his vital signs with a pulse oximeter and his saturation was in the high 90&#39;s and his pulse was normal in the 80&#39;s range. He pointed to his chest and he said it hurt him and for about three hours he appeared to experience moderate to severe pain. I called the pediatrician who said these symptoms were not uncommon. I can&#39;t remember if I gave my son tylenol or advil to help alleviate symptoms. His symptoms appeared to resolve within 3-5 hours. Also, he had felt feverish and sluggish after the administration of the vaccine for the three days leading up to the symptoms of chest pain.

A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm, at age 17 years, on 12Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pressure in his eye from an injury, asthma (diagnosed when the patient was about 2) and has family members with asthma and heart conditions. Patient is in perfect health, he works out 6 days a week, and does football conditioning 5 days a week. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Concomitant medication included timolol taken for pressure in his eye from an injury from an unspecified start date to 20May2021. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. The patient historically received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number: EP7534) at the left arm at age 17 years on 22Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient got his second dose of the vaccine on 12Apr2021 and shorty after on 19Apr2021, he became very fatigued, very weak, his chest hurt, and he had shortness of breath. On Apr2021, patient had dizziness. The patient used to have bulky arms and now you can see his muscle mass depleting in Apr2021. The patient cannot focus on school online because of the headaches from 19Apr2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure goes up and down from 19Apr2021. For days from 19Apr2021, the patient&#39;s heart rate will be fine in the 60s and it goes up to 120 or 130 with chest pain, it fluctuates depending on the day.  The patient visited the emergency room on 05May2021, but was not admitted and no one knows what was going on with the vaccine. It was also reported that the patient lost 14 pounds on 25Apr2021 since the second dose of the vaccine. They knew the patient has already lost 10 pounds and then yesterday, 25May2021, the patient weighed himself and noticed he has lost another 4 pounds over the weekend. Patient had bloodwork on 20May2021 and it was all negative. The primary care provider was concerned about the weight loss so she ran a bunch of blood work. The patient is negative for COVID test and chest x-ray on 21May2021 and he has had multiple tests done. The patient went to his primary care provider on 25May2021 (yesterday from the time off reporting) and the reporter mentioned that maybe can they look at this as being a side effect from the vaccine. The patient&#39;s doctor laughed and said nothing has been proven yet about this. The reporter felt that this is a reaction to the vaccine. At the time of reporting on 26May2021, the patient was not able to function and sleeps all day. The patient also underwent lab tests and procedures that includes being tested negative for mono twice now (on unspecified dates). Clarified that they have not filed a safety report with Pfizer on the patient&#39;s events. The outcome of the events &#39;dizziness&#39;, &#39;lost 14 pounds since the second dose of the vaccine/lost another 4 pounds over the weekend&#39;, &#39;muscle mass depleting&#39;, &#39;cannot focus on school online&#39;, &#39;not able to function&#39; and &#39;sleeps all day&#39; was unknown; while for the other events, it was not recovered.

                                                The minor patient was at the pharmacy to receive a second Pfizer Covid vaccination.  Upon review he stated he had experienced dizziness with previous vaccinations years ago, but never fainted.  The technician administered the vaccine and the father knocked on the window to get my attention.  I ran out front as the patient was stating his vision was becoming blurry.  The technician and I lowered him to the ground as he lost consciousness.  We elevated his feet and he immediately regained consciousness.  He started to stand and we advised him to remain seated.  We laid him back down and after several minutes he requested water which was given.  A few minutes later he was able to stand and took a seat in the waiting area for 30 minutes.  He was feeling better and had no other compaints.

                                                Within 24 hours of receiving his 2nd vaccination, my son began complaining about heart pain. He described them as sporadic, and mild in nature - mostly an annoyance. The pain was not associated with increased heart rate or increased/labored breathing.  He has never experienced anything similar in the past and is in exceptionally good health (He runs long distance cross country and track for his high school). Three days from his vaccination, I took him to his primary care physician where the performed and ECG which the doctor interpreted as &#34;normal&#34;, and most likely not Myocarditis. He recommended Advil (3 tablets up to 4 times a day) for a few days, to reduce any potential inflammation, which he began immediately.   Once he began the Advil regiment, his conditions ceased to come back and he has not experienced any further episodes even after he stopped taking Advil. Is is now exactly 7 days after his 2nd vaccine.

                                                Vaccine administered at 1215 pm. In waiting area around 1225 pt felt very faint sitting in chair next to grandmother. Patient appeared to have seizure like activity and paramedic called immediately. After 1 to 2 minutes patient started responded well and just stated she felt very faint. Paramedics arrived and waiting for patient to fully recovered. They did state her blood pressure decreased to below baseline but quickly came back up to normal as patient started feeling better. They deemed patient to be stable and didn&#39;t think it was from the vaccine itself versus receiving an injectable vaccine as patient often feels faint after giving blood. They walked patient and grandmother to their personal car so she coudl be taken home.

After 10 minutes sitting down, his mom notified us the patient fell on the floor. He hurt his right eye brown and caused bleeding  and we called 911 . I took the patient sat on the chair in the lobby and tried to clean his opened wound on the eye brown. We gave him drink some water and he felt tired and light dizziness.After 20 minutes, 911 came and checked his pulse, oxygen, and clean his wound. After 30 minutes, patient felt okay and no longer having dizziness and he refused to go to Emergency. He still had pain from hurting eye brown.

The pt was sweating and not responding for about 5 minutes, after the pt was awake and the EMS saw him the pt started feeling much better and did not wan t to go to the  hospital.  The pt only had juice and it was after 1:00pm so this could have been a contributing factor.  The pt stayed 30 more minutes with me after the EMS left and he was completely fine.  I also think the pt since he was a minor was really nervous.

                                                Patient is a 17 year old male presenting with post-vaccine myocarditis. He had his second dose of his Pfizer COVID vaccine 3 days ago (6/11/2021) and that evening felt some mild burning central chest pain. States that the pain has been intermittent since then, non-pleuritic, non-exertional, but last night he had a severe episode that woke him from sleep, so his mother called the pediatrician who recommended he come to the ED. ED Course: Vitals - T: 36.7 °C, P: 79, R: 20, BP: 119/73, O2 SAT: 98% RA EKG - NSR 74, no acute abnormalities CXR - no acute process Trop - 32 Echo - normal  PICU Course Cards: Troponin downtrending from 32.7 =&gt; 25.3 =&gt; 22 =&gt; 23.1 at time of discharge.

I ran over to make sure the patient was alert and he tried to stand up after falling so we escorted him to a chair and called 911. I waited with the patient until the fire department arrived, the patient was sweating, pale, and seemed to be breathing normally.

He had other flu-like symptoms but he said it was difficult for him to swallow. He still had a fever of 100.9 and it lasted until the fourth day. The following day it was not much better so we went to the doctor and all tests were negative. It was still sore until the fifth day and then it subsided. We tried some Tylenol and Ibuprofen and it helped the fever but not the sore throat. It has been six days and he is fully recovered.

                                                He had sharp chest pains  that would come and go in left side near ribs beginning around noon on 6/17/2021. They seemed to worsen throughout day &amp; with laying down. Then, increasing pain along left side of body into hip and leg around 5:30pm. He experienced very &#34;bad, cramp-like&#34; pain in left calf area around 6:30pm. Sharp Chest pains intermittent at &#34;10 pain level&#34; &amp; lower left leg at &#34;8 pain level&#34;. Some nausea and vomited once at this point. We called the urgent care line for our doctor&#39;s office and spoke with  nurse who instructed us to go to the ER. They performed ECG and Chest XR. Labs were BMP, CBC, CK, D-dimer (quantitative), &amp; Triponon-I.  They gave 800mg Motrin, IV fluids and keterolac in IV. They said they &#34;did not identify a specific problem&#34; but to rest, take ibuprofen, and follow-up with doctor and cardiologist. They said it was most likely related to the Covid-19 vaccination but could not give causation.  Patient seems fine so far today, but still has medication in system.

                                                My son got both his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 shot as well as a booster for Tdap. (Unsure of which Tdap or lot#) at 11:30 pm 6/18/2021 he was fine. About 30 mins later he was hit hard with side effects. Said he was very shaky and felt hot and cold at the same time. He did not let me know about this until this morning around 7:50 am 06/19/2021 about how he was feeling and he was still feeling very bad, advised him to take tylenol and he took that and went back to sleep. Around 12:00 PM 06/19/2021 I was finally able to check his temperature and other vitals. His temperature was normal, but his heart rate was 138 bpm. I made him sit down and relax for a bit and heart rate leveled out to normal.  He also reported he is afraid to eat that he feels nauseous. As of this afternoon 06/19/2021 he seems to be feeling better.

This occurred 5 days after receiving his 3rd dose of his Pfizer vaccine (6/16). He received a 3rd dose at the recommendation of his PMD after being informed that his 2nd dose was expired at the time when he had received it on 6/7 Following this vaccination he &#34;slept for 18-20 hours&#34; and had subjective fevers which self-resolved after 24 hours. He developed dyspnea, acute onset of R-sided/mid chest pain and the sensation that his heart was racing. He presented to the ED and was admitted to the PICU for monitoring. Labs revealed elevated troponin (240 ng/L) which downtrended to 89 ng/L by 6/23. Concern for myocarditis vs pericarditis in setting of recent Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine; started on ibuprofen 400mg PO q6h.

                                                On 06/02/2021, (23 days after vaccine) the patient and his identical twin brother were at dinner when patient had shortness of breath and chest pain.  They brought the patient to Medical Center where a CT of the chest was performed to rule out a pulmonary embolus.   No pulmonary embolus  was identified and patient was transferred the patient via ambulance to  Hospital to the intensive care unit.  He was noted to have an elevated troponin, an elevated BNP and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. He underwent a cardiac MRI on 06/04/2021 documenting delayed enhancement in the inferior and inferolateral walls of the left ventricle consistent with myocarditis.  The patient&#39;s chest pain was quite severe and was only relieved once he was in the intensive care unit at Hospital.  He did well for 2-3 days and did not require inotropes but his troponin vacillated and his ejection fraction remain low.  He was given IVIG non 06/05/2021 after his echo showed an ejection fraction between 37 in 45%. He subsequently developed headache emesis and neck pain.   On hospital day 5, the father was quite concerned for his son and thought ?he was going to die?.   The father shared pictures of the edematous, pale son that he took with his phone. He improved over the next 1-2 days and was discharged from the hospital with an ejection fraction on 06/07/21 of 62%.

On Friday, patient was vaccinated with the second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. On Saturday night, he started presenting with headaches, myalgia, a temperature of 100.0F, and chest pain. Such pain is sharp, mid-sternal, non-radiating, a 7/10 at it&#39;s worse, and worsened by lying down. For the chest pain he has been taken Tylenol 500mg and Ibuprofen 400mg as needed, with minimal improvement. The next day, his headache, myalgia, and high temperature resolved but he persisted with the chest pain. Today, he took Tylenol 500mg at 7:20am with minimal improvement. Due to persistent chest pain, he presented to our ED. Overall, he denies any UR sxs, trauma, SOB, emesis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, sick contacts at home, and known COVID-19 exposure. Denied any family history for sudden cardiac death, congenital heart disease, or arrhythmia. Currently not taking any medications. No known allergies. VUTD.   In the ED, CXR normal. Troponins elevated to 2.8. EKG with sinus rhythm, ST elevation with normally inflected T wave, and normal axis, intervals, and voltages. COVID ID now negative. He was given one dose of Ibuprofen at 11:30am with chest pain improvement to 2/10.   In CICU, the patient arrived at RA, hemodynamically stable, with good pulses, cap refill less than 2 secs, and chest pain 2/10.   During his hospital course, troponin uptrended to a maximum of 5.09. Repeat level in the afternoon with consistent downtrend at 2.86. EKG with ST elevations consistent with pericarditis but hemodynamically stable, with good pulses, cap refill less than 2 secs, and no chest pain. Echo with no structural abnormalities, no significant valvar dysfunction, and normal LV systolic function. CXR on 06/14 normal and in no respiratory distress. Pain management controlled with ibuprofen 600mg q8hrs and Tylenol PRN. Currently with no chest pain. Mycoplasma IgM and IgM and RPP pending and will be followed as an outpatient. Physical exam unremarkable. Will follow up with Dr. on 06/25/2021. Advised patient and family to refrain from strenous exercise for 2 weeks and no sports for 3-6 months.

A 17-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for Injection, Lot Number: EW0173 and Expiration date was not reported), via intramuscular, administered in Deltoid Right on 04Jun2021 15:00 (Age at vaccination was 17-year-old) as dose 2 single for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included no, Vitamins (It is the gummy bear vitamins multivitamins for kids). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 for covid-19 immunization. On 06Jun2021the second day they have to go, he woke up with chest tightening and chest pain, and know it was ever harder for him to laid down, so he was not comfortable in sitting up and he woke up with a chest pain lying down. so they had gone to the emergency room and there were some test that they run and one of which the ultrasound of the heart and the EKG in which they saw that that there was elevation of the ST in the EKG and then he was given some medicine she thought it was Ibuprofen or something and then they said that it was fine or it was like pericarditis or myocarditis something like that so when they were advised in the discharged notes that for like more than was whole night they were discharge at the ER on Monday 07Jun2021 around 4 am. The discharge note it says that if you still feel the chest pain or anything or he feel like get sore and feel not much better than they had to go back then and advised to be seen by the primary care doctor or pediatrician which they did on 3 days after on the 09Jun2021, that was the Wednesday seen by his primary doctor so all the paper work was sent and they were advised to be seen still waiting to be seen our current pediatric current in neurology. They do not really know if from the plan of the ER if they know what was going on with his heart hopefully it get resolved or something but then they still do not know firstly was on the ER do not know and there was no medication only in the discharge note if he feel pain or something give him like the Ibuprofen (treatment), Morphine other stuff but a since the time that we were out of the ER, did not give him that because he did not feel the way he did when we went to the ER. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: elevation of the st on 06Jun2021, ultrasound chest: unknown results on 06Jun2021. Therapeutic measures were taken because of chest tightening and chest pain. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Patient is a 17 year old male with only past medical history of anemia at 1 year of age (resolved with iron and vit C supplementation), who presented to an Hospital on 7/7/21 with 2 days of chest pain radiating to his L arm, generalized upper extremity weakness, SOB, vomiting, found to have an an elevated troponin level of 0.626 with ST segment elevation on EKG, echo reportedly normal.   Patient reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 on 6/6  and subsequently went into quarantine, was re-tested on 6/21 and tested negative.  He arrived on 6/28 and received his 1st dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 07/03/21.  Of note, he was told he might feel dizziness and arm achiness after the vaccine but denies he was informed about possible inflammation of or around the heart after the vaccine.  On 7/5 he was awakened in the morning by chest pain 6/10 and shortness of breath that started in the right lower sternal border and progressively moved to the left lower sternal border and then to his L shoulder and arm which he describes as feeling like he had been &#34;punched&#34; or a constant achy feeling.  He took Tylenol x1 on Monday with minimal improvement.  He initially thought it was reflux pain and took tums but it did not improve.  He had one hour of relief but then the pain returned.  He reportedly felt dizzy Monday evening as well.  The pain was absent on Tuesday, but he woke up this morning again with the same chest pain and shortness of breath, prompting him to seek medical attention.  In the outside ED, he had one NBNB emesis that was not preceded by nausea.  En route from Hospital to Hospital he complained of chest pain 7/10 for which he was placed on 2L O2 which reduced the pain to 4/10.  During his admission his troponin levels initially up trended and peaked at 5.67 before beginning to downtrend.  He was diagnosed with myopericarditis and started on ibuprofen three times a day around the clock. He was discharged home on 7/8 with specific return precautions, follow-up appointment with cardiology, and strict instructions to avoid exercising and strenuous exercising until cleared by cardiology.

                                                History of Present Illness 17-year-old male who denies any major medical problems presents to the ER concern for chest pain.  The patient states that he stayed up all night and he woke up this morning around 12:30 p.m., around 1 hour prior to arrival and he was having a tightness in his chest.  The tightness is constant, seems to go down his left arm.  He has never had this happen before.  He received his Pfizer vaccination for COVID-19 on Friday of last week and he feels like he has had some aches since that time.  He has been taking Motrin for this and this morning he also took Motrin but there is no significant relief.  He has no significant shortness of breath, no nausea vomiting, no diaphoresis.  I spoke with him privately and he denies any history of cocaine abuse.  Per his mother he has healthy, no major medical problems.  He has not recently had any other concerns or recent review systems.  No history of having blood clots or DVTs.  Medical Decision Making: History examination as above.  Patient presents our concern for tightness in his chest with some radiation to his left arm over the past 1 hour.  His EKG does show J-point elevation but he has no risk factors, he is hemodynamically stable well-appearing on examination.  He has no shortness of breath, nausea, diaphoresis.  Differential includes myopericarditis, early repolarization.  Feel that the likelihood of STEMI, ACS is low.  Will obtain a troponin as a part of his workup, chest x-ray for evaluation of cardiac silhouette size, bedside ultrasound.  I do not suspect that he has a PE.  He has no tachycardia tachypnea hypoxia.  No external findings of suggest a DVT on examination.  I do not suspect that he has cardiac tamponade, CHF, pulmonary process such as pneumothorax, pneumonia based on his history.  Do not suspect a GI etiology.  Will monitor closely here in the ER and re-evaluate.  Time 2:30 p.m..  The patient&#39;s troponin is elevated at 7. I consult with Cardiology and I spoke with Dr- we reviewed the patient&#39;s EKG, his presentation, his history.  He feels this is secondary to myocarditis from likely the COVID-19 vaccination.  I have added a viral PCR as well as a part of his workup.  He does not recommend activation the cath lab, he does not feel this is a STEMI.  I do agree based on the history and the patient&#39;s appears this time.  He recommended a formal echocardiogram as well. -I spoke with the ultrasound technician at bedside and there is no evidence of wall motion abnormality.  This is consistent with my examination. -given the patient&#39;s elevated troponin we do not have capabilities of caring for him here.  Not have Pediatric Cardiology, we do not have a PICU if the patient&#39;s condition were to worsen.  There for the patient requires transfer to tertiary center. -will consult with another hospital for transfer.  Time 3:22 p.m..  I spoke with Dr, he accepts for transfer.  No recommendations for medications at this time.  The patient is chest pain-free, hemodynamically stable.  Spoke with the ultrasound technician there is no evidence of cardiac wall abnormality, pending official interpretation with our cardiologist. -asked for emergent transfer because I do not want the pain to be waiting here in the ER with possible worsening condition, worsening troponin elevation without cardiology consultation at a pediatric specific hospital.  I do not want him to have the chance of deteriorating at this facility and therefore I do feel that he warrants emergent transfer as opposed to routine where he could wait here in the ER for hours.  I do feel that benefits outweigh the risk and I spoke with the patient and his family about this and they agree.  Critical Care: 55 minutes.  Emergent evaluation on presentation given his EKG showing STEMI per computer interpretation.  Time spent for multiple re-evaluations, discussion with Cardiology and outside hospital consultants, time spent with documentation.  Time spent with family.  Complex medical decision making. Serious life threatening disease process. Potential for death and increased morbidity. Exclusive of procedure time.

                                                Heart fluttering; Palpitations; Gray skin pallor; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number and expiration date was not reported), via an unknown route of administration on 09Apr2021 single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical included Psoriatic arthritis, hypermobile joints, chronic fatigue, hypermobile joints, and Iron dextran complex. Patient previously took first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number and expiration date was not reported), via an unknown route of administration on 19ar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient concomitant medication included Benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin phosphate (BENZACLIN); Celecoxib (CELEBREX) for arthritis; Loratadine (CLARITIN (LORATADINE)); Secukinumab (COSENTYX); Bisacodyl (DULCOLAX (BISACODYL)); Multivitamin (VITAMINS NOS); Prednisone; Senna acutifolia; Vitamin D3 and Diclofenac Potassium (VOLTAREN). On 30Apr2021, the patient experienced heart fluttering, palpitations, gray skin pallor. Occurs randomly, lasting 20-30 seconds per episode. The clinical outcome of the heart fluttering, palpitations, gray skin pallor was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.  Follow up needed; Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported Cardiac flutter and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. The case will be assessed further upon receipt of additional information.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                COVID vaccine-associated myocarditis.  3 days after his second Pfizer COVID vaccine, pt presented for chest pain and pressure. Troponin was initially elevated to 4.2, EKG showed ST elevations in lateral leads. Over the course of his stay, troponin dropped, then rose to peak of 14, then dropped again. He was treated with Naproxen 500 mg BID and Pepcid 20 mg BID for gastroprotection. As chest pain resolved, troponins improved, and EKGs improved. Echo and Cardiac MRI were done.

                                                PT is a 17 y/o previously healthy boy who presents with 3 days of moderate-severe, substernal chest pain, dyspnea, and nausea 2 days after receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On Tuesday (7/6), PT received the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The following day (Wednesday 7/7) PT had &#34;flu-like symptoms&#34; with chills, subjective fever, and a sore arm that resolved by Thursday (7/8). He was back to his baseline state of health on Thursday (7/8) and felt fine that whole day. On Friday afternoon (7/9) when he was at work washing dishes where he had some physical exertion he began to notice at 16:30-17:00 that he developed substernal, sharp, 7/10 chest pain that did not radiate, improve/worsen with deep breaths, sitting up, laying down or with movement of his upper extremities. It worsened towards the end of the night and peaked at 8/10 by 22:00-23:00 that same evening. His sister picked him up from work per his regular routine and he went home and took a shower which improved the pain to a 5-6/10 when he went to sleep. He woke up at 3 AM on Saturday (7/10) AM and had one episode of NBNB emesis associated with the chest pain. When he woke up later that morning he felt improved until 10-12 AM he developed mild chest pain again which he took Tums for. He also tried Motrin which did not help his pain at all. On the morning of admission (7/11), he woke up at 6-7 AM with upper right back pain, dyspnea, and nausea along with the persistent chest pain which prompted him to present to MFSH. He does endorse mild sore throat but denies any fevers, recent sick contacts, known COVID-19 exposure or previous history of COVID-19. There is a family history of cardiac disease including a fatal MI in his father. His mother&#39;s family also has a history of heart disease and both sides have a history of high cholesterol. He did add Whey Protein recently to his diet to for muscle building, but he DENIES any drug, alcohol, tobacco, vaping, marijuana, THC use. He does not play any sports regularly. He also denies any recent bug/tick bites or rashes.

The client said he attempted to finish his run with the pain, but had to intermittently walk. The client stated the chest pressure resolved once he started running. The client also reported feeling drowsy to his mother when he returned home from his run. No medications were administered for the initial chest pressure. The client did not follow up with a primary care doctor regarding the initial chest pressure. The client denies any chronic conditions. The client&#39;s mother stated he currently takes vitamins and minerals on a regular basis, but denied any chronic medications. The client has a history of anaphylaxis to shellfish.

PATIENT SUMMARY:  Reason for Hospitalization: Chest pain    Admission HPI: a 17 year old young man with a remote history of asthma (last used inhaler 5-6 years ago) who is presenting with 1 day chest pain in the setting of recent Pfizer Covid vaccination. He received his second Pfizer vaccine dose 3 days ago. The following day, he experienced low grade fever to 100.4 and mild headache. He felt fine yesterday, but this morning he woke up with dyspnea and feeling like he &#34;couldn&#39;t get air in all the way&#34;. He denied feeling chest pressure but endorsed mid sternal chest pain without radiation. The pain was not exacerbated by exercise and was not positional. He presented to an urgent care facility this morning, where they did an EKG that showed ST segment elevations diffusely. He was then transferred to Hospital.  he was overall well appearing with slight tachypnea but otherwise normal vital signs. He initially was not endorsing chest pain. They drew a troponin that was elevated to 1515 ng/L with an upper limit of normal 54 (likely 1.5 on our scale). BNP, electrolytes, CBC were all within normal limits. Initial EKG did not have any ST segment elevation. They did a chest XR which did not show any signs of pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly. He later developed chest pain so an EKG was repeated which showed recurrence of the ST elevations diffusely; most prominently in V1-2. Repeat troponin was 2000. He was given a single dose of aspirin 81mg and transferred for further care.   In the ED, he was well appearing and no longer endorsing chest pain. He was monitored on continuous telemetry with no abnormalities. His troponin here was 0.27 ng/mL, CRP was elevated to 2.6, he had a mild transaminitis of 41/37 and mildly elevated LDH to 236. Covid antibodies were positive. CBC, ferritin, d-dimer, ESR were all within normal limits, rapid Covid/flu/RSV negative. Repeat EKG was similar to the second EKG with very minimal ST-segment elevations.   He denies any URI symptoms, rashes, N/V/D, and joint pain. He&#39;s had good PO intake until today. He is an athlete (currently playing baseball) and has never experienced chest pain with exercise.   Surgical hx: T&amp;A  Family history: Negative for any cardiac pathology or autoimmune disease  Allergies: rash with penicillin  Social: here with grandma who is legal guardian  Hospital Course: admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. The morning after his admission, his troponin was uptrending slightly to 0.37 and echocardiogram showed mildly depressed systolic function and longitudinal strain, so the decision was made to treat. Cardiac MRI performed prior to treatment showed good systolic function but mild LV late gadolinium enhancement and corresponding hypokinesis. He received one time IVIG 2g/kg and IV methylprednisolone 30mg BID for 2 doses. His chest pain came and went throughout his admission and was treated with ibuprofen and Tylenol as needed. He was transitioned over to PO steroids on 7/20 which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were trending down. Pt was scheduled for outpatient follow up including ECHO at that time.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Chest pain was fully resolved. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  Prednisone for myocarditis to complete 5 day steroid course (last dose morning of 7/24)  Famotidine (GI protection while taking prednisone)  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued equipment: NA   Relevant Diagnostic Images/Studies:   Echocardiogram 7/19: ? Technically difficult examination due to suboptimal echocardiographic windows. Unable to evaluate the atrial septum, systemic and pulmonary veins, pulmonary arteries, and aortic arch. Coronary artery dilation is not excluded. ? Normal valvular function. ? Normal left ventricular size and low-normal systolic function. Reduced longitudinal strain. ? Qualitatively normal right ventricular systolic function. ? No pericardial effusion.  Cardiac MRI 7/19: ? Normal left ventricular size and global systolic function. ? Basal inferoseptal, inferior, and inferolateral left ventricular late gadolinium enhancement with corresponding mild hypokinesis. ? Normal right ventricular size and global systolic function. No right ventricular late gadolinium enhancement or regional wall motion abnormalities. ? No significant valvular dysfunction. ? No coronary artery aneurysms. ? No pericardial effusion.  Admission EKG 7/18:  ST segment changes, non-specific.  Discharge EKG:  minimal ST segment changes, improved from admission.

Collection date displayed. Cytomegalovirus PCR, blood, QuaNT:  (Blood) 07/19/2021.  Final Report: No CMV detected by PCR. This test does not detect latent CMV infections. A reference range for this test has not been established. Results should be interpreted in the context of other clinical and laboratory information. This test should not be used to diagnose latent or previous CMV infection. People with latent or previous CMV may not have detectable CMV DNA by this test. The variability of this test should be considered when interpreting results. Changes of approximately three fold in the quantity of CMV DNA detected may be due to variation in the test rather than actual changes in the level of CMV DNA in the sample. Note: This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Hospital. It has not been cleared or approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. Epstein-Barr Virus PCR, QuaNT:  (Blood) 07/19/2021.  Final Report: No EBV detected by PCR. This test does not detect latent EBV infections. A reference range for this test has not been established. Results should be interpreted in the context of other clinical and laboratory information. This test should not be used to diagnose latent or previous EBV infection. People with latent or previous EBV infection may not have detectable EBV DNA by this test. The variability of this test should be considered when interpreting results.

Health Care Proxy: Under 18 years old MOLST: Under 18 years old  Follow-Up and Patient Instructions  Patient Instructions  He was admitted for management of myocarditis thought to be due to his SARS-CoV2 vaccination. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle that can happen with many different types of infections and virusesHe received IVIG and steroids. He had multiple EKGs, echocardiograms, and a cardiac MRI which showed mild changes but overall good heart function. His chest pain and heart studies improved throughout his stay and he was safe for discharge home.   He should refrain from strenuous exercise for the next couple of months and you should discuss when it is safe to return to exercise with your outpatient cardiologist.    Medications:  --- Prednisone 30mg twice per day for _ days (last day _)  --- Famotidine 20mg twice per day for _ days (last day _)   It is important to minimize activity that raises his heart rate for the next 3 months. This will be discussed in more detail at cardiology appointment. Until then, no strenuous exercise.   Attending Attestation  CARDIOLOGY INPATIENT ATTENDING DISCHARGE NOTE:  I reviewed the history and hospital course, examined the patient on rounds, reviewed the testing, discussed the findings with the Cardiology Team, and participated directly in formulation of the assessment and plan for discharge.  I have reviewed and agree with the documentation above with the following additions/revisions:17yo admitted with COVID vaccine associated myocarditis, with repolarization abnormalities on ECG, elevated troponin, and chest pain within days after receiving his 2nd dose. He remained hemodynamically stable with preserved ventricular systolic function. Echo did show abnormal strain, and MRI showed LGE with focal hypokinesis. Due to increasing troponin level, he was treated with IVIG and steroids with improvement in troponins. No significant arrhythmia. Plan for follow-up next week with MISC/vaccine myocarditis group, and to complete a 5-day course of steroids. Restricted from sports and intense activity for likely at least 3 months.

He passed out for several seconds then came back and said he felt hot, fingers on right hand felt tingling. Looked like he might have passed out again but for only 1 second. My mom requested EMTs be called, EMTs called and patient taken by ambulance to hopital. Mother did call 2 hours later saying the patient was released and doing fine.

I steadied him in the chair until he came back to, approx 20-30 seconds. When he awoke he said he felt nauseous, hot and sweaty. I provided him with a water and had him stay seated until he felt he could stand up, approx 10 minutes. He then left with his father, who was with him the entire time.

At further inspection I noticed that he was having a rash . I had a sit for a few more minutes then his mom came up and we noticed that his arm started to swell. We gave him 2 capsules Benadryl 25mg and instructed him to go to urgent care. Called for a follow up later in the evening and found that urgent care send him to the ER. The rash was spread all over and well as the swelling. He swelled all the way to his toes. He also tuned white and became very lightheaded at the ER. They gave him IV Benadryl and dexamethasone and was sent home. It has been recommended by the ER doctors to not get the 2nd dose.

The following morning he felt feverish and achy with malaise. He stayed home, drank fluids and rested and felt well enough to come up to ski this weekend. During skiing he had some anterior chest pain, it resolved and he went about his day. Tonight at 2245 the pain became sharp and awakened him from sleep. He felt nauseated and clammy as well. Father brought him to the ER for evaluation. His emergency department evaluation showed ST elevations most notably in the inferior and lateral leads as well as in the lateral precordium.

Noted the following day this his eyes looked yellow, more that usual, and came to the clinic on 3/1/21 for evaluation.  was feeling better but due to acute jaundice had blood work that indicated markedly elevated bilirubin and low platelets.  Further testing for hepatitis was negative.  Was sent to the ER the following day as we were unable to get blood drawn and GI consult was desired.  There he had a normal abdominal US and bilirubin had dropped and he has since been followed by GI and is currently being evaluated by Hematology for any underlying conditions that may be contributing.

                                                Patient presented to the emergency department early March 28, 2021 after experiencing 5-7 hours of chest pain. The chest started when the patient went to bed the evening of March 27, where he began having substernal non-radiating chest pain with inspiration. The pain was relieved by sitting upright and by taking some acetaminophen. He received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on March 25 (first dose was March 5). He was initially treated with ketorolac 15mg IV and given 1 liter of lactated ringer&#39;s solution via IV.  His chest pain resolved after this. He was eventually given colchicine 0.6mg twice daily and ibuprofen 600mg 3 times daily due to concern for myopericarditis. He was ultimately found to have no evidence of pericarditis after undergoing a cardiac MRI, thus colchicine and ibuprofen were discontinued. Due to findings of mildly reduced ejection fraction on imaging, he was started on metoprolol XL 25mg once daily at discharge.

                                                My healthy 18-year old son had his first dose of Pfizer, and within a few minutes he felt dizzy. His heart rate was also rapid. He didn&#39;t think much of it, but the dizziness persisted and so they had him lay down with feet up. After about 20 minutes, he began to vigorously shake (rigors I believe is what it is called.) He felt numb in both arms and also his tongue and mouth. We had 3 nurses attending to him, and after about 30 minutes they decided to send him to the ER for evaluation since the very strong shaking and other symptoms were worsening. The shaking, dizziness, numbness all subsided after about an hour. He was given a Zyrtec upon first symptoms about 15 minutes after dose. The ER doc doesn&#39;t believe it was an allergic reaction but potentially a strong vasovagal response and immune response. He felt tired after but was completely fine 2 hours later. We were discharged from the ER a few hours later after evaluation. Vitals were in normal range including blood sugar, blood pressure and oxygen. He was fully hydrated prior and had a turkey sandwich and orange prior to coming so was not low on food either. The shaking was very extreme and concerning. It has been almost 24 hours and he is feeling fine other than a sore arm.

EMS checked the patient and cleared him approximately 20-25 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

She stated patient looked gray and said his oxygen saturation was 78%. His blood pressure was 88/60. She poured cold water on his chest, thinking he could be overheated. She instructed another nurse to call 911.  A call went out over the walkie-talkie for a Charge Nurse to come to the scene at 1440. At this time the other nurse was already on the phone with EMS. When I arrived to patient around 1441, patient&#39;s oxygen saturation was 99% and pulse was 80. He was pale. He was talking coherently. He stated he had not eaten all day. I gave him some hard candy to suck on.  Around 1445, EMS arrived. They assessed him and determined he did not need additional care.  He signed EMS forms and the patient&#39;s brother drove him home. Patient was advised to make sure he did not go a whole day without eating before getting his second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Patient started complaining of headache and chest pain soon after vaccination.  Since then he has been to the Emergency Room 6-7 times for chest pain - workup is consistently negative He has seen two Cardiologists, a Neurologist and has had further workup.  It should be said that I feel it is probably not vaccine related and is likely anxiety related - however patient insists that it is related to the vaccine - he has never felt like this before.

                                                Approximately 11 days after receiving my first dose, I began feeling dull pain in my left calf. By Saturday, 4/17, the pain was severe enough to warrant a trip to the emergency room. After receiving an ultrasound of my leg, two blood clots were found in my left calf. One fully occluded a vein and another partially occluded a different vein.

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm at the age of 18-year-old on 07Apr2021 09:50 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing congenital diaphragmatic hernia (that prevented his lungs from developing before he was born). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (FLU) for immunization and without a reaction. Caller is a consumer, calling about his 18 years son who received the covid vaccine this morning and had an adverse event afterwards. Caller reported that his 18 years son had his first covid vaccine dose this morning. He has had all of his vaccinations, even the flu shot every year without a reaction. After having his covid vaccination, on the way home he said he started feeling light headed. He was supposed to go back to school once they got home but the caller noticed that his son hadn&#39;t left yet because he drives himself. He reported that his son&#39;s room is downstairs and when he looked his son was laying down at the bottom of the stairs and appears to have passed out. He reports that now he is fine and he has eaten. Calling now because he was concerned and &#34;wanted to make sure there was nothing else I should do in this situation&#39;&#39;. Caller stated that he took his two kids to get their vaccines. His son is 18 years old and his daughter will be 18 next Tuesday.Stated that they stayed at the site in case of a reaction to the vaccine and nothing happened. On the way back home the son became lightheaded. Caller thought maybe he needed to eat even though he had eaten a light breakfast before they went to get the vaccines. Stated his son got home and passed out. Caller had never seen his son pass out before. Said his son fell down the stairs while going to the basement where is room is located. Caller was concerned this could&#39;ve been a reaction and is calling to see if there is anything further they should be concerned about. The son&#39;s vaccine, lightheadedness, passing out, and falling all took placed today 07Apr2021. Caller said he nor his son are certain if he was injured during the fall. His son thinks he hit his head and his knee and noticed that his shorts where ripped behind the leg on 07Apr2021.  Caller states his son says he is feeling back to normal and fine. The son was supposed to go to school after the vaccine but the caller had him stay home so he could keep an eye on him. Caller stated it was scary. The caller opened the door and saw his son lying on the floor with the gum he had bought at the drug store strewn out everywhere. Caller stated they are believers in vaccines. Stated his son used to have a part time job at the grocery store bagging groceries for customers and was wanting to go back to work. Caller also said that his son was born with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia that prevented his lungs from developing before he was born. Caller stated that due to this him and his wife felt it was best for the son to get the vaccine since if he got the Covid virus it could have been really bad for him. Caller denies any medications, labs, testing or treatments that are relevant to these events. Caller stated his son is healthy. Stated when his son mentioned being lightheaded in the car, the caller didn&#39;t think much of it. The outcome of events was recovered on 07Apr2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Initially appeared to be a syncopal episode, but while unconscious, exhibited myoclonic activity and possible airway involvement/apnea. SpO2 was 79% initially during this episode, but quickly bounced back up to 100% when he regained consciousness. EMS called due to possible airway involvement.  EMS arrived,, VS WNL at that time, however patient BP did not increase with postural changes (pt showed postural hypotension), so EMS transported him to local ED.  On 4/27/2021, I spoke with patient family to check in and patient mother reports that ED doc told her he was likely dehydrated and had a &#34;severe syncopal&#34; episode. Reports no adverse effects or expected effects from the vaccine and will likely return for his second dose. For second dose, our staff will ensure he is lying down supine for  vaccine administration.

                                                Recipient received dose #2 vaccine today, and almost immediately had response with witnessed seizure-like activity, with posturing, tonic-clonic movement of his upper extremities, and eye movement with lateral nystagmus. Loss of consciousness was noted. Symptoms lasted approximately 15-30 seconds, and patient was placed in a reclined position. He regained consciousness quickly and became pale and diaphoretic. He was normally responsive and answered questions appropriately. Initial BP 74/32, HR 38, SpO2 98%. He drank some Gatorade and had improvement of symptoms gradually over 15-20 minutes. Repeat BP 100/58, HR 78. No past history of seizures. One prior syncopal event after pain response with sports injury. No prior difficulty with dose #1. After recovery, patient reported immediate pain with vaccine administration, then vision went blurry and he lost consciousness. Mother was driving the vehicle, and she witness symptoms as well as nursing staff in the vaccine pod. After recovery, options for further medical evaluation were discussed given complicated vasovagal response with seizure-like activity, mother called pediatrician to see if he could be seen, they recommended ER. Mother chose to drive by personal vehicle, rather than EMS transport. Symptoms were fully resolved and patient was transported to ER for further evaluation by personal vehicle.

An 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number and expiration date were not reported) on the left arm on 12Apr2021 (11:30) as a single dose, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included peanut and penicillin allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On12Apr2021 (11:45), the patient had loss of consciousness; seizure; drowsiness/could not stay awake; and vomiting. The events had resulted in an emergency room/department for urgent care, and were assessed as serious (medically significant). The patient was hospitalized in Apr2021 due to loss of consciousness. The patient had received epinephrine (EPIPEN) as treatment for the reported events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Apr2021. The patient did no have COVID-19 prior to the vaccination, and had not been tested post-vaccination.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He went to stand up and then blacked out, falling to the floor. He did not injure himself or experience any trauma in the fall. He did not lose consciousness. I believe he was experiencing increased anxiety from the event as the patient mentioned several times that he did not like needles/injections. The patient remained sitting upright for an additional 15 minutes, drinking water, and his mother escorted him out of the store and drove him home.

An 18-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 14Apr2021 at 11:30 AM at the age of 18-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization at Public Health Clinic. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies to nickel and dust mites. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient developed severe chest pain between the night of 16Apr2021 to 17Apr2021, and was admitted to the hospital on 17Apr2021, diagnosed with peri/myocarditis. The cardiology team was convinced it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. He remains hospitalized (number of days of hospitalization was also reported as 2). The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, and hospitalization. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination which was a nasal swab with negative result on 17Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of peri/myocarditis which included ibuprofen, aspirin, and colchicine. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was hypotensive (64/43) with a FSBG of 108mg/dL. EtCO2 and EKG were normal. EMS administered 1L normal saline and transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient reported being &#34;anxious for days&#34; about getting the vaccine and remembers hyperventilating prior to syncopizing. Upon assessment, the patient was normotensive (126/79) following fluid therapy. The patient reported improvement in the ED. The physician discharged the patient with diagnose of vasovagal syncopal episode secondary to an anxiety inducing event.

He had an abrasion. He stated ?he felt hot and dizzy?. He hasn?t had anything to eat all day. Due to the abrasion, he was rushed to the hospital  About 3 hours later, I called to check on the patient. At the time of calling, the patient was discharged from the hospital in good condition.

Troponins were done which showed significant elevations. Patient diagnosed with myopericaditis, likely 2/2 vaccine. No other illness whatsoever. Further diagnostic tests were ordered, patient unfortunately left AMA before further workup was completed.

He initially had chest pain the day prior to admission with pain in his back and down his left arm. This improved with Tylenol and resolved prior to bed. On the morning of 5/6 the chest pain returned and was so severe it woke him from sleep. He was difficult for him to characterize, but he said it was all over his chest, sometimes sharp and pressure-like, most severe in mid substernal region and was so substantial that he had difficulty speaking properly. He feels that the pain is most severe when lying flat and is best managed when he is resting at a 45 degree angle. Patient was at ED he was found to have an initial ECG with ST depressions in aVR and elevations in II, aVF, and V2 through V6 raising suspicion for pericarditis/myocarditis. Initial troponin was elevated at 4.35 as well. Cardiology Dr. was contacted by ED physician, case discussed, and EKGs reviewed and felt this was more likely pericarditis, but not STEMI. Of note, he reports a family history significant for his mother having a?hole in her heart.?He was given Toradol with improvement in his pain and upon arrival to hospital his chest pain was markedly improved.  He was noted to have troponins peaking at 39.415 that down trended and an elevated CRP of 4.8 on admission. D-dimer was 0.26. Covid PCR was negative.  He was evaluated by cardiology again here who upon review of his ECG and cardiac enzymes as well as presentation was consistent with pericarditis. Echocardiogram showed normal LV systolic function with trace posterior pericardial effusion and telemetry was monitored without any arrhythmias. He was started on low-dose beta-blockers, aspirin 650 mg 3 times a day, and colchicine 0.6 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses followed by 0.6 mg daily. He is planned to continue this for approximately 3 months and will need to follow-up with cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks for repeat monitoring and management with plan to taper off aspirin once his CRP normalizes.  Later that night, he even had a similar episode of sudden onset chest pain for which she received IV Toradol with minimal relief and oral Tylenol with relief of symptoms after that. No telemetry abnormalities were recorded at that time.   ECG the following day showed improving ST changes and troponin of 26.328 with CRP 4.2. He had no further symptoms for over 24 hours and is responding well to treatment.   He is advised to take Tylenol as needed in addition to the above-mentioned medicines should he have any recurrent chest pain.

                                                Patient (DOB 05-01-2003) received his 1st COVID vaccine (Pfizer, lot # EW0182 use by 5/15/21 at 0855) at 1539. The patient became pale approximately 30 seconds following the administration of the vaccine, EMT assisted the patient to the chair as he was standing up when he became pale, the patient loss consciousness for approximately 2 seconds. RN arrived at the station and assisted the patient to the ground, where he was placed in a supine position with his lower extremities elevated. The patients face mask was removed, he was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The patients color slowly returned to his face. Vitals were taken at 1540: BP: 155/70 (R arm, supine position), HR 70, RR 16, oxygen saturation at 97%, and pupils were equal. The patient had a history of fainting x 1 and his last meal was at 0800 and he stated, &#34; I didn&#39;t drink that much today.&#34; Denied any chronic medical conditions, was not currently taking any medications, and denied any drug allergies. The patient was moved to the anti-gravity chair and he was given pringles and Gatorade. Vitals were retaken at 1545: BP 162/80 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 50, RR 16, oxygen saturation at 97%. Denied any dizziness, headache, chest pain, or vision changes.  Vitals were retaken at 1553: BP 158/72 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 52, RR 16, Oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient was advised to eat a full meal prior to receiving his second COVID vaccine dose and to receive his 2nd dose in the anti-gravity chair. Vitals were retaken at 1558, BP 152/78 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 57, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient was also given a bottle of water, as he did not consume many liquids during the day. The patient&#39;s color fully returned to his face and he denied any shortness of breath, dizziness, changes in vision, or difficulty swallowing. Vitals retaken at 1603, BP 150/75 ( R arm, sitting upright), HR 60, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient called his mother to pick him up, as we strongly advised him to not operate machinery/ a vehicle after fainting. The patient&#39;s vital signs were taken at 1608, BP 140/75, HR 60, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient was advised to drink the entire bottle of water, as his blood pressure was slightly elevated and it was most likely due to being dehydrated, as he did not consume any fluid since 0800 earlier that day. The patient drank a bottle of water and his vital signs were retaken at 1614, BP 122/68 (R arm, sitting upright) and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. The patient&#39;s mother arrived on site around 1630 and spoke with RN and both EMT. RN instructed the patient about emergency precautions and to follow up with his primary care provider. RN also educated the patient about the importance of informing the healthcare provider about his history of fainting with the first vaccine, when receiving the second COVID Pfizer vaccine. Gave the patient V-safe information and reported the occurrence in VAERS. The patient had a steady and even gait when leaving the site with his mother at 1632.

An 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EW0169) at single dose, on 22Apr2021 at 17:30, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. Patient&#39;s mother reported that her son fainted within 30 seconds of receiving the Pfizer vaccine 1st dose and since then he had experienced some intermittent light headedness and dizziness. He passed out completely after shot. Adverse events were described as following: &#34;patient is due to get his second dose of the shot later this evening but is having periods of lightheadedness and dizziness. Patient&#39;s mother states that her son also feels like he is going to pass out. She states that this started 30 seconds after the first shot. Her son only passed out once, completely right after the shot, it was a bad experience. She&#39;s glad he actually wants the other one today, but he is concerned because he is still lightheaded and dizzy after 3 weeks. Patient&#39;s mother states that he has been trying to function, work, and live his life but its irritating to him and scary. The doctor suggested that he should get his second dose but her son is a little fearful&#34;. Physician Office Visit required. The patient did not recover from intermittent light headedness and dizziness, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile and strong temporal relationship there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the reported events and the suspect drug.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I RAN OVER TO THE PATIENT AND ASKED IF HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING, TO WHICH HE DENIED. I BEGAN TO ASK HIM WHERE EXACTLY DOES IT HURT TO WHICH HE MENTIONED HIS LEGS AND BODY.  SINCE HIS BREATHING WAS FINE, I SUSPECTED IT WAS JUST A PANIC ATTACK BUT NONETHELESS I PROVIDED HIM AN ICE PACK AND WATER. WE ALSO MOVED HIM TO A MORE PRIVATE AREA TO ELEVATE HIS LEGS. I OFFERED TO CALL 911, BUT HE DENIED. WE KEPT HIM FOR 30 MORE MINUTES WATCHING OVER HIM TO SEE HOW HE PROGRESSED. HE FELT MUCH BETTER TOWARDS THE END. THE PATIENT ADMITTED HE WAS HAVING A PANIC ATTACK. MY TECHNICIAN OFFERED TO CALL A FAMILY MEMBER TO COME GET HIM, BUT HE DENIED AND SAID HE WAS OKAY TO DRIVE HIMSELF HOME.

                                                Moments (~1 minute) after the vaccination, the patient described  his ears as filling with fluid and he became very dizzy. He and his mother went to the restroom where she helped him to the floor so he did not fall. He reports not remembering walking to the bathroom, and was woozy when I (the pharmacist) arrived to the restroom. His breathing was elevated, and he was pale in color. No emergency medication was administered . Paramedics arrived to check him out, and he left the store under his own power.   The vaccine-administering technician reported that he seemed very nervous to receive the vaccine today. When I was talking to him in the restroom he admitted that he has a history of anxiety/panic attacks when receiving vaccines in the past.

He had generalized muscle aches and mild flu-like symptoms which were not unexpected on Monday the 17th.  On the 18th, he reported dyspnea on exertion, some chest tightness, and his throat felt like it was &#34;closing&#34;.  He also had tender anterior cervical lymph nodes and a fever to 100.8 °F.  He came into the ER for further evaluation. After evaluated by cardiology, given his stability, felt appropriate for discharge with immediate outpatient follow-up.

                                                Patient received vaccine around 5 pm. For the first two minutes after vaccination the patient seemed to be fine. Starting around that 3rd minute the patient got very dizzy and nauseous. He was then seated to prevent further NV. I asked the patient if they were breathing ok and the patient stated his breathing was fine. After about another minute the patient&#39;s eyes got glossy and the patient seemed to be out of it. I asked multiple orienting questions such as his name, where he was, and what day of the week it is. He was only able to answer the day of the week and his head was bobbing. I then called 911 as the patient became very pale and started to profusely sweat. While on the phone with the 911 operator, the patient went completely unconscious and lost control of motor functions. I was able to confirm the patient was still breathing and still had a heart rate (although rapid) and thus compressions were not given. The EMT arrived quickly to the scene and took over care of the patient. After about 20 minutes of checking vital signs, the EMT gave the patient and his family the option on whether they want to go to the hospital or not for further examination. The family decided they wanted to take the ambulance to the hospital.

The reporter stated that the patient went to the emergency room and an electrocardiogram was done on 30Apr2021 that came back normal, so he was sent home. The reporter would like to know if there was any guidance that could be provided on the safety of the patient getting the second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

He was admitted to the hospital on May 11th 2021 for a vaso-occlusive pain crisis. He then developed fevers, increased inflammatory markers, coagulopathy and significant tachycardia- echocardiogram, was done which showed coronary artery aneurysms raising concern for Mis-C. Retrospectively, his previous echocardiogram few years ago also showed coronary dilation although now it was slightly worse.  patient was given IVIG and steroids as treatment for Mis-C following which fevers resolved and his inflammatory markers improved. He is being followed with serial echocardiograms which shows stable echo findings.  He remains in the hospital still for treatment of his pain crisis.

An 18-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 07May2021 (at the age of 18 years), as first dose, single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no known allergies. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. On the day of the first dose of vaccine (07May2021), the patient developed sore throat. The next day (08May2021), the patient had fevers and sore throat, developed headaches and chest pressure. Fevers persisted for 5 days so presented to emergency department with rash on palms and soles, diagnosed with myopericarditis, possible atypical Kawasaki disease; all started on 08May2021. The events were considered serious per hospitalization in May2021 for 8 days. Treatment received for the adverse events included vancomycin, ceftriaxone, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), ibuprofen, aspirin, and dobutamine. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19 (nasal swab) that was negative on 12May2021. The patient was recovering from the events.  Information about lot or batch number cannot be obtained. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the event myopericarditis, Kawasaki disease, sore throat, pyrexia, headache, chest pressure and rash mostly represented intercurrent condition in this patient, unrelated to Bnt162b2.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

                                                pericarditis; a large pericardial effusion; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. An 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown), at the age of 18 years old, at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter explained the only probable trigger to the 18-year-old male patient developing pericarditis and a large pericardial effusion was the receipt of the first dose of BNT162B2, 2-3 weeks before the diagnosis. The reporter added he read through the CDC website, about increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis after getting the second dose of BNT162B2. The reporter asked if the second dose was contraindicated after such adverse reaction to the first dose. The outcome of events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events of Pericarditis and Pericardial Effusion and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed once new information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I began to have random chest/heart pressure when breathing out/ swallowing food or drinks. I began to rest and took ibuprofen (Motrin) to relive my side effects. I soon began to feel more or less the same symptoms  on the 26th and 27th of May. On the 28th I woke up to the sides of my stomach hurting, but went away once I ate breakfast. Days go by and I felt my symptoms going down. Around May 30th to June 1st, sometime in between I felt that my symptoms had been relived, As of June 6th, the day I am reporting this event I have not felt what I felt during those days.

I called our advice nurse, and she said we should call 911. EMS arrived a few minutes later, and took a LOT of tests -- blood oxygen, EKG, etc etc. And all of them looked fine. But he was clearly not himself. He described a great pressure on his chest, at a pain level of 7 (out of 10). They gave him some anti-inflammatory OTC and left. I stayed home with him that day. After about 5 hours he seemed to go back to normal and has been good since.

RN lifted his head to open airway and pt started convulsing and turned bright red. RN yelled for help. RN leaned the chair back to lay on the floor, holding patents head so it would not hit hard. Pharmacy worker called 911. Pt stopped convulsions and started coming too then turned very pale. He said he was starting to feel better but wanted to remain laying on the floor. When paramedics arrived they assisted him up in a chair, took his vitals, he was stable. Then checked his blood sugar and pt immediately passed out again. RN again assisted to lay him back in the chair to be flat on the floor. He again became very pale. Paramedics placed him on the gurney and took him to ER to be evaluated.

The Dr didn&#39;t seem that interested in knowing that he had just had his 2nd vaccine. She ordered x-rays that showed his lungs were normal, Did an EKG that was normal. His blood pressure was 159/110 however they didn&#39;t think that was a worry (I did.) They provide him Tordall for inflammation and sent him home for the day. I don&#39;t believe Dr took it very serious.

An 18-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on an unspecified date (at the age of 18 years old) at first dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization at the pharmacy. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On an unspecified date on the same day of vaccination, the reporter stated that the patient developed tingling in his right arm mostly the end and then he developed tingling in his right leg. The patient then developed chest pain; because of chest pain, the patient was brought to the emergency room on an unspecified date.

The physician stated that patient had extensive treatment for chest pain which is that patient was brought to the emergency room and had an EKG. The outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

At that point I stayed with the patient and called for my pharmacist. The patient lost consciousness, and by the time my pharmacist got there he was stable and coherent. Once my pharmacist assessed the situation she had me call 911 for paramedics.  We had him lay on the floor with a pillow under his head, feet elevated.  We provided ice water, nuts as a snack, and I dabbed sweat from his forehead while holding an ice pack to his forehead. I stayed with the patient and patients girlfriend until paramedics arrived for transport.

The next day (08JUN2021 @10AM) my son came down from his room to eat breakfast and still was not feeling the best but seemed fine after eating.   Around 12PM my son came down the stairs to get some water in the kitchen and then shortly thereafter after passed out, fell against the wall and slid down to the floor.  I was in the location and found him unresponsive, very cold, and eyes looking straight ahead -not moving.       My older son and I then carried him to the couch where I laid him down and elevated his feet. He started coming around approx. two minutes later and broke out in a sweat but also had chills.  At that point, I did not call an ambulance and started to hydrate. After an hour or so, he started feeling better and then ate some food but was weak most of day and rested.  The next day he seemed fine.

                                                Patient was extremely nervous and has always been nervous about needles. The parents let me know that he had passed out in the past from vaccinations. Patient received the vaccine fine and was sitting in our waiting area. I was standing in front of him when he suddenly felt sick and passed out. I used cold compresses and gave him a cold bottle of water when he was able to drink.  My staff called 911 and they checked him out. He able to stand and walk out  after about 15 minutes.

I yelled and shook the patient.  He became alert.  He was no longer unconscious at this point.  He began sweating, his eyes kept closing.  He complained of feeling nauseated and having a headache.  Pharmacist immediately called 911.  Paramedics arrived (@ 1:40pm).  They check his vitals.  BP was 80/59. Patient then alerted the paramedics that he had to use the restroom.  He has been having diarrhea for at least the past 3 days.  Paramedics took him to the restroom.  He then was asked to have a seat outside of the restroom where his vitals were done again.  They started an IV and ran an EKG (@ 1:55pm).  Paramedics brought in stretcher and were taking him to the hospital for further observation (@2:10pm).

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

He passed out and was helped to a sitting position.  When I was called out to the lobby patient was still feeling a little lightheaded but he was conscious and breathing normally.  He sustained a small cut on his hand which we cleaned up promptly.  Patient told mom he felt like his vision was  blurry.  Mom wanted him checked out so I called emergency help.

He regained consciousness right away and didn&#39;t remember passing out.  I asked him to recline and elevate his legs and he held that position for several minutes and then seemed fine after that.  He said he has an extreme fear of needles and felt he passed out from the anxiety he was feeling prior to getting the shot.  He remained in the post-vaccine waiting area for an additional 15-20 minutes and did not have another episode of syncope.

The mom, accompanying the patient, started helping him off the floor and as I was helping her, the patient immediately woke up and regained consciousness, but was a little pale. I brought water for the patient, took his blood pressure which was about 100/50. His mom brought him orange juice and as I was sitting with the patient, he stated that he usually faints when getting blood drawn and such. I sat with the patient for about 10-15 minutes, and  he was improving, regaining color and more talkative. I then had the patient slowly get up and had his blood pressure measured again and it was 105/75 which according to himself and his mom was his normal. They then decided to leave and the patient was doing well by then.

                                                Per patient he received his second Covid vaccine 3 days prior to arrival and immediately following developed myalgias, subjective fevers and &#34; viral symptoms&#34; which she managed with ibuprofen 2 tabs q6h some improvement.  On the day prior to arrival he developed increasing shortness of breath particularly with talking and with ambulation.  He also describes chest tightness with deep inspiration, the tightness radiates to back, no radiation to left arm or jaw.  Chest tightness is non-positional, but does feel worse immediately after he lies down from ambulation and then slowly dissipates.  His last subjective fever was yesterday evening.  He has never had a reaction to the vaccine before.  He has no allergies.  No prior medical conditions he is aware of, and takes no medications.  He did not experience any of the symptoms following the first vaccine. He has h/o asymptomatic COVID infection in November 2020. Cardiology consulted for concern of pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccine. He does not have significant ST elevation or PR depression.  He also does not have evidence of significant pericardial effusion at this point.  The high sensitivity troponins are mildly elevated.  He does have viral syndrome.  Is unclear if Covid vaccination was causally related to his symptoms.  We would like to improve his medications for better chest pain control and to prevent recurrent pericarditis in the future.

Sat down he started to sweat profusely. Told him to take his sweatshirt off. Continues to sweat his forehead his T-shirt was wet his back was wet. Then he tilted his head back his eyes rolled back into his head. I called the nurse. We got him to a wheelchair and behind the curtain. Before we had a chance to put him on the Exam Table he passed out and started to seize for the count of 3 or 4 seconds. Then he woke up. He said he saw white beautiful light. I am not kidding. He does not joke. Then he said he was fine. Insisted he was fine.  His bp was low for the first two readings. Then It came back up to normal. He laid flat for 15 more min. Had some juice. Sat up when It was gone to go. Bp got super high. We waited till It was normal and left.

Pfizer vaccine Lot: EWO153 Exp: 07/21 administered at 1535. At approximately 1545 he got up from his chair and asked where the restroom was.  When he turned to go to the restroom he fell to the floor without bracing his fall. His head hit the floor and then ?bounced? and hit again. He appeared to be unconscious for about 30 seconds but was A&amp;O to date, place, name when he woke up. He did say that he thought he lost consciousness at some point because he ?woke up with everyone standing over him?. When he fell he was diaphoretic and pale- I asked him if he was a diabetic and he states yes. He said he ate before coming and took ?8 units of insulin?. He also said his BG was 121 prior to eating- finger stick done at 1549- and was 88; which he states ?is not low for me?.  Doctor out to assess him and advised he needed to be evaluated by ER. The ambulance was called for him and his mother was notified.  While waiting for EMS he had trouble keeping his eyes open and his eyelids were fluttering, c/o his head hurting and being tired, he continuously yawned and rolled his tongue asking for water. 1559 EMS arrived and took over care of patient at this time.

                                                heart failure; heart attack; fluid in his lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 19-year-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 25Mar2021 (received at the age of 19-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing seasonal allergies and cardiac murmur he had as an infant. When probing medical history, the consumer reported that as an infant, her son, had a heart murmur. Her son saw a heart specialist in (State) who did an ultrasound/sonogram of her son&#39;s heart. The specialist said the heart murmur was fine and nothing needed to be done. She also adds that for family medical history, she and her husband don&#39;t have any early onset heart issues in either side of their families. She also reported that her son has horrible seasonal allergies. Concomitant medication(s) included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; triamcinolone acetonide (NASACORT) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; montelukast (MONTELUKAST) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The reporter stated that her son (patient) had a heart attack (26Mar2021) after receiving the first dose of bnt162b2. The patient also experienced heart failure on 28Mar2021 and had fluid in his lungs on Mar2021. She called regarding the COVID-19 vaccine on behalf of her 19-year-old son who received his first vaccine on 25Mar2021. Her son received his first Covid 19 vaccine at a PRIVACY where he attends college. On Friday, 26Mar2021, he was feeling crummy, on Saturday, 27Mar2021, he was feeling crummy. On Saturday night, 27Mar2021, her son started texting her around 11:30PM saying he had pain in his left shoulder and left arm. He had already taken 2 Advil and it wasn&#39;t helping with the pain, her son asked if he could take a third Advil. The reporter told her son he could take a third Advil because it had been an hour and a half since he had taken the first two Advil. The texts from her son continued. He was getting no relief. He took a hot shower and tried self-massage and warm compresses. He ended up throwing up and he said he felt a little better. Her son tried to lay down and couldn&#39;t get any relief from his pain. The pain was tremendous in his left shoulder and arm. Her son told his mother, he thinks he needs to go to the emergency department. His mother is two hours away from him and told him to call 911. Her son had a friend take him to the emergency department instead of calling 911. Her son went to PRIVACY. While at the emergency department, the doctor thought that her son&#39;s pain was muscular. Her son received an injection of Toradol. Her son was discharged from the emergency room and went back out to his friend who had brought him to the hospital. Her son and his friend didn&#39;t even make it out of the emergency department parking lot when her son suddenly couldn&#39;t see anything. His eyes were wide open and all he could see was black. His ears started ringing. Her son went back into the emergency department. Her son received Benadryl and an Epi-pen thinking maybe he was allergic to the Toradol and having a reaction to the Toradol. Her son had blood work, an EKG, and vital signs done in the emergency department on 28Mar2021. His blood work were over 3000 which the reporter reports, indicates a heart attack. The emergency room doctor did not think the Toradol would have pushed his Troponin levels that high. With her son complaining to her about the pain in his left shoulder radiating into his left arm and throwing up, those are signs of a heart attack. Her son was maybe playing off the seriousness of the pain he was experiencing. It was agreed at that point it might be her son&#39;s heart. She was about 18 minutes away from the hospital when she received a call from the hospitalist, the doctor taking care of her son. And that doctor tells her that her son is not doing well and is not responding to treatment of the bag of saline fluids. The doctor is trying to get her son&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate back up. The doctor was afraid he might have to air flight him to the PRIVACY hospital. She told the doctor she is 18 minutes away and asked if he can wait that long or does she have to turn around and drive the opposite direction to the PRIVACY. At this point her son was having a COVID-19 viral test in case he needs to be transported to the other hospital. The doctor tells her that her son can wait the 18 minutes until she gets to the hospital. She arrived at the hospital and wanted to see her son, her son is on high flow oxygen and she has to gown and glove up to be in his room for fear of Covid particles since he&#39;s on the high flow oxygen. His COVID-19 viral test results have not come back at this time. Her son was admitted to the hospital for heart failure. He was in the hospital for 5 days. He was admitted in the wee hours of the morning on 28Mar2021. During the time he was in the hospital he had chest x-rays and he was given Lasix to get the fluid off his lungs. His white blood cells were way up so he was given an antibiotic. He had an MRI, Chest X-rays, and a Heart Catheterization through his wrist that would indicate that he had blocked arteries in his heart. He had no blocked arteries. The heart catheterization revealed an artery going into his 4th heart chamber was slow to open and close. The cardiologist prescribed Metoprolol for six months with monitoring. The cardiologist feels the Metoprolol will repair his artery and get his blood pressure and heart rate numbers where they need to be. He was admitted to the hospital at around 3:00AM on 28Mar2021 and was discharged on 01Apr2021. Her son&#39;s COVID-19 viral test came back negative, but his COVID-19 antibody test showed that he did have COVID-19 antibodies. The doctor didn&#39;t know if that meant that her son had a previously undiagnosed case of the COVID-19 virus or if he developed COVID-19 antibodies that soon after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. She reported when her son was discharged, he was feeling better, but still had residual fluid at the bottom of his lungs. Her son did have to go for a chest x-ray on Tuesday, 06Apr2021, after he was discharged, to make sure the fluid was making its way out of his body. When he was discharged from the hospital, he had some shortness of breath and he was tired and weak feeling. The pain in his left arm began before he was admitted to the hospital. The shortness of breath started during his hospital admission. At this point in time she would say her son has improved. The Metoprolol he was prescribed by the cardiologist is one half of a 25mg tablet once at nighttime. She stated that she does not have any information on how low her son&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate were during his time in the hospital. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the adverse events. Outcome of the events was recovering.

Every time he blows his nose, it is bloody. Never in 19 years have I observed this. My son is a college athlete and is extremely strong and healthy. These symptoms do not seem to be going away. The bloody nose is the most unusual effect and we are concerned this is an inflammatory side effect.

Same symptoms returned (chills, low fever, heavy sweating, tense breathing) approx. 60 hours later along with severe aching chest pain. All symptoms resolved by next morning besides chest pain, which was severe enough to warrant emergency room admission about 72 hours after vaccination. Admitted to hospital overnight with an episode of palpitations around 6pm on the first night, being given motrin and colchicine throughout stay. Pain somewhat resolved and was discharged aprox. 100 hours after vaccination. Continued use of ibuprofen and colchicine in weeks following as pain slowly resolves.

The following day developed substernal chest pain radiating to neck and left shoulder and arm.   Also reports fever of 101 degrees on 5/10/2021.  Used Tylenol, initially with some reloief, but symptoms worsened over the course of the next few days.  Then presented to ER on 5/13/21 because of worsening pain.    EKG showed diffuse ST elevations c/w pericarditis.  Initial Troponin 11.1, ultimately peaking at 13.67, c/w myopericarditis.   Admitted to hospital for supportive care, and treated with PO colchicine.   A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal LV function without segmental wall motion abnormality and no pericardial effusion.  A Cardiac CT showed normal coronary arteries.     The patient&#39;s symptoms improved with colchicine.   He was discharged home with a course of colchicine on 5/15/21.   A subsequent outpatient Cardiac MRI did show epicardial and mid wall late gadolinium enhancement involving the basal to mid lateral and inferolateral walls, and a mid wall stripe of distal anteroseptal, septal and inferoseptal segments, c/w myocarditis, idiopathic cardiomyopathy or sarcoidosis.  The pericardium was borderline thickened at 3 mm.

Diagnosed with myopericarditis possibly related to the Covid vaccine and pt was transferred to the Hospital for cardiac MRI and further work-up. Upon transfer to the hospital, cardiac MRI was performed and showed acute myocarditis with no evidence of pericardial thickening or pericarditis. It also showed left ventricular function was at the lower limits of normal with a calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and no focal wall motion abnormality. He was treated with colchicine 0.6mg, pepcid 20 mg, and ibuprofen 600mg for the myocarditis and oral morphine 15mg and tylenol 1,000mg for chest pain. He was counseled on avoiding strenuous activity for the next 3 months and following up with cardiology upon discharge.

NP went out to waiting area with cool paper towels, found pt with head on left shoulder and eyes closed.  NP tapped pt on shoulder and asked if he was ok, pt became alert immediately.  Pt&#39;s face was pale and shirt was very sweaty.  He said that this had happened a couple of times before when he has received immunizations.  Placed wet paper towels on pt&#39;s forehead and neck.  He drank some water.  He said that he was feeling better as soon as he came to.  Color was coming back into his face.  NP monitored pt directly for 15 minutes more after this. BP at this point was 100/64, pulse 72.  Color was back to pt&#39;s face, had him stand up for 2 minutes before allowing him to leave the clinic area.

A 19-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0187, NDC number and Expiration date are Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 22May2021 11:30 (at the age of 19-years-old) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of historical vaccine, bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0176, NDC number and Expiration date are Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 01May2021 10:30 (at the age of 19-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect were none. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations were none. Family medical history relevant to adverse events was none. Relevant tests were unknown. It was reported that her 19-year-old son got the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 22May2021 and 2 days later on 24May2021, he wound up with chest pain and the caller took him to emergency room and the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis and admitted to the hospital. The Reporter clarified the patient&#39;s chest pain started when he woke up around 08:30-09:00. On an unspecified date in May2021 at 23:30, the patient had a fever starting about 12 hours from receiving the second dose and it lasted for 24 hours, and the patient didn&#39;t feel well on an unspecified date in May2021. At one point he didn&#39;t want to wake his parents up around 11:30 p.m. but he was warm on an unspecified date in May2021. At 0600am the next day, the caller took the patient&#39;s temperature, and his fever was 100.9 Fahrenheit. The caller carried the patient to the emergency room on 24May2021 due to his chest pain. It was reported that patient&#39;s EKG was extremely irregular and caller stated that if it was her or her husband&#39;s EKG, they would have been having an MI, but since the patient was only 19, the doctors didn&#39;t think MI was possible. The patient was then diagnosed with myocarditis. It was reported that the patient experienced diarrhea on 24May2021. Chest Pain required a visit to Emergency Room on 24May2021 and the patient was hospitalized from 24May2021 to 26May2021. It was reported that, the patient received treatment with Colchicine 0.6 mg (NDC number and Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: 26may2022) one tablet by mouth twice a day.

The patient had completed this medication. Ibuprofen 600 mg (NDC number, Lot number: unknown and Expiration Date: unknown) 1 tablet by mouth three times a day for six days and this has script had ended. Caller stated that her son was recovered but that he was still taking the treatment medications at this time. Caller stated that her son&#39;s symptoms are improved, he was not complaining of chest pain anymore, she assumes his myocarditis was improved because he was not complaining of the chest pain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 100.9 Fahrenheit on an unspecified date in May2021, EKG (electrocardiogram): extremely irregular on 24May2021, PCR COVID test (sars-cov-2 test): negative on an unspecified date in May2021 while in the hospital. Caller stated the patient had an EKG showing irregular heartbeat.It was reported that the patient had tests but she didn&#39;t have results available and the patient had a PCR COVID test in the ER. Caller stated that all of this was related to the vaccine. Caller also stated that she is wondering if her son would have reacted differently if he had gotten the Moderna, but caller and her husband had gotten Pfizer and didn&#39;t have any problems. Reporter seriousness for Myocarditis, diarrhea and fever was unspecified. The outcome of the events, Myocarditis, chest pain, diarrhea and irregular heartbeat was recovering and for fever was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021 and for other events was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.

My blood pressure was taken at 180/150 and I was told to stay sitting down for 30 more minutes.  After this time, my blood pressure was normal.  I did not have a reaction to the second vaccine, however, I did take 400mg of Benadryl before the vaccine

He was unresponsive and mom had to catch him before his head hit the ground. I did not want to wait to determine if patient was breathing or not and gave him epinephrine in case he could have been allergic. I was concerned because he did not express any nervousness or history with fainting after vaccinations.

Paramedics arrived within 5-10 minutes and by the time they came patient regained consciousness but was telling them he was feeling very weak and numb.

A 19-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm in muscle on 07May2021 17:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 19-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There was no medical history.   No family medical history relevant to events.  There were no concomitant medications.  No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 07May2021, his vision got all spotty and he could not see, pupils got bigger than normal after the vaccine, had blue lips, white face, blood pressure really dropped, and he lost vision at one time immediately afterwards, and he felt cold. The time of onset of events was around 5pm. Events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. They stated they had given a thousand of this vaccine and this had never happened before. They stated they had never seen what happened to his son before. The patient did not get the second one yet and was told not to get it. All events happened a few minutes after the vaccine during the sitting/waiting period. About after 5 minutes the most after administration this all started and they had to treat him with an ammonia thing to wake him up. It&#39;s the one you break it under the nose and they were ready to do an Epi Pen also if needed. He improved within half an hour to 45 minutes of this. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. Mentioned they all in his family did the Covid vaccine.  The patient improved and they advised him not to get the second one. It was Facility to tell them that. The pharmacist from there just gave them a call wanting to know why the son didn&#39;t return for the second dose and he explained what happened since this pharmacist did not know what happened that day. Patient did not see doctor or go to emergency room since his condition improved dramatically after about 45 minutes or so. Father kept asking patient how he felt or if there was need to see doctor and patient declined. The outcome of events was recovering.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On the morning of Sunday, June 6, 2021, I woke up with dull pain in the center of my chest (right where the sternum is). My mother took me to urgent care. A doctor there did an EKG with came back slightly abnormal, and she recommended I go to the emergency room. The doctors there ran a few tests. By about noon or so, my chest pain had subsided and has since not returned. My only abnormal test was troponin. After the first troponin test, I was transferred from the ER to an observation area. After the fourth troponin test, Dr. ordered an angiogram. The angiogram occurred on June 8, 2021, at around 5:00 pm or 6:00 pm. It revealed no signs of damage or inflammation. I was discharged from the hospital the morning of June 9, 2021. Since then, I had a follow-up with my primary care provider, on June 15, 2021, and with the Dr. on June 23, 2021. Neither of them detected anything wrong with my heart. To summarize, I went to the hospital with chest pain that subsided quickly and has not returned since, and I remained in the hospital with elevated troponin.

Leading me to admit myself to the ER, where they gave me an IV of hydroxyzine &amp; famotidine. The next day my rash was completely gone and I felt much better.

                                                Patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and experienced a syncopal event causing dizziness soon after receiving the vaccine. The pharmacist responded immediately and emergency medical services were contacted immediately. The patient was standing at the time symptoms began and dizziness caused the patient to fall over. The patient was guided to a chair and the pharmacist took the patients blood pressure which was approximately 90/60. The patient did not exhibit any signs of difficulty breathing and was alert after sitting down. The patient had a small cut on their left thigh from falling over. The pharmacist cleaned the cut and bandaged it then retook the patients blood pressure after about 5 minutes. At that time the patients blood pressure had returned to normal (approximately 125/70) and the patient was feeling fine. Emergency medical services arrived and the patient was able to walk outside to the ambulance. EMS retook the patients blood pressure again and the results were normal and consistent with the second reading taken by the pharmacist. The patient felt normal and did not require any additional emergency medical services at the time. The patient was contacted approximately 2 hours after the adverse event and still reported feeling fine and was being monitored by his parents at home. The patient was instructed to contact EMS should any symptoms occur after going home.

The technician who had gave the shot and I rushed out help him. He regained consciousness right away but he had bit his lip which made his lip bleed a little and the glasses gave him a small cut under his eye. We had him lay down for a few minutes afterward and cleaned and bandaged his small cut. His mom did mention afterward that he sometimes get dizzy when he has blood drawn. This was never stated on the patient questionnaire. The patient waited the required time after the vaccine and said he no longer felt dizzy and felt fine. We put notes on patient&#39;s file of the event and to walk him to his seat and observe him closely with his 2nd dose.

A 19-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 28Apr2021 (Lot Number: ER8735) at the age of 19 years old, at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. There were no concomitant medications. There was no other vaccine in four weeks or other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced arm pain at site in 2021, headaches in May2021, fatigue in May2021, bruising all over body in May2021, undetectable platelets in 2021, immune thrombocytopenia in 2021, petechiae in 2021. Arm pain at site, mid-May: headaches, fatigue, bruising all over body. Hospitalized with undetectable platelets and Immune thrombocytopenia and petechiae. The patient was hospitalized for all events for 3 days. All events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 23Jun2021. The outcome of the all events was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Got heart inflammation, probably pericarditis based on the symptoms though that is usually paired with myocarditis. Also had some heart palpitations and a much more noticeable heartbeat accompanied with chest pain. Symptoms started the morning after getting the vaccine. Fatigue for 1 day, mostly recovered by day 2, fully recovered from all symptoms by day 3. No fever.   Going to assume the heart was affected because the injection was in the left arm (near the heart). Might have caused a higher density of cytokines to be near heart tissue and cause inflammation.   Also I didn&#39;t go to a doctor because no insurance, figured I would rather take my chances with a heart attack. Cause I would be guaranteed to have a heart attack after seeing that medical bill.

He recovered within a few minutes. Per patient, he has history of fainting from vaccination and bloodwork because of fear or anxiety from needles. He was sitting in a chair. Patient&#39;s father held him when he fainted. Patient&#39;s father and patient refused to call 911. I recommended him to go to hospital so that further treatment/evaluation can be determined. I called patient on 7/26/2021 at 4:45 pm to follow-up. He said he went to hospital/ER for post-vaccination evaluation and everything was ok.

Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

Patient was seated in waiting area and around 6:10PM a loud noise was made due to metal chairs moving in the waiting area; upon turning around patient was face down on the floor with his head turned to one side. I ran to offer assistance and cushioned his head with my hands. EMS was dispatched immediately. Patient was already starting to come to after losing consciousness for approximately 10-15 seconds, looked confused for about 15 seconds and then seemed to return to a normal mental state immediately after. He was able to give his name and info and knew exactly where he was, etc. and he stated he felt much better. He was able to confirm he hit the side of his head on the floor, however it was not bleeding. I asked if he wanted me to call anyone for him but refused the offer. His blood pressure was taken at 6:15PM by us then again when EMS arrived at approximately 6:20PM and was 140/100. He was checked out by EMS, including a blood glucose reading of 81 and seemed to be okay. They offered to take him via ambulance to the hospital, especially given him hitting his head, but he refused the offer. He explained a similar incident occurred when he received IV contrast dye in the past. He was able to sit up and then stand up without any issues. He continued to wait in the waiting area for about 10 more minutes before leaving to ensure he felt back to normal. I followed up with him at 8:20PM via telephone and he stated he was feeling normal and had no questions/concerns. I assured him he could reach back out to me personally or the store here if he had any questions/concerns in the future.

He waived at us and sat down. We asked if he was ok and he waived again stating he didn&#39;t feel well. He sat back down and we proceeded to check on him. As we were coming to check on him, he fainted and fell face forward on to the floor. We called 911 and rolled him gently to his back. He had a laceration  above his eye from the fall. EMT came and assessed the patient. After observation, he was allowed to be picked up from his friend and taken to a clinic for stitches.

Patient was admitted into the hospital for 2 days (4/27-4/29) for this substernal chest pain. A CTPE, EKG, and CXR were ordered that were unrevealing as to the etiology of the chest pain. Troponins were elevated on admission with a slightly decreased delta (515-&gt;479). An ECHO was ordered that showed a LVEF of 35-40% with moderate global hypokinesis of the left ventricle, right ventricles moderately dilated, and no pericardial effusion.  A Cardiac MRI was then ordered to determine etiology that showed subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement of the basal inferior and mid-inferior and inferoseptal wall consistent with acute myocarditis. Additionally, a small pericardial effusion without signs of inflammation, calcification, or cardiac tamponade physiology. Patient was then D/C on 4/29 after the cardiac MRI with no medical therapy with the recommendation to not partake in physical activity for one month. Will have follow up with cardiology clinic in 1 month and will participate in cardiac rehab.

                                                Patient experienced syncope/fainting episode approx 15 mins after vaccination. Patient stood from chair and complained of nausea, asked for water. Legs buckled, patient fell to knees. Did not fall all the way to floor or experience head/body trauma. Patient was attended to by supervising pharmacist, and subsequently moved into chair with assistance. Pulse and respirations were normal, but patient was pale, diaphoretic, and complained of nausea and dizziness for another 15-20 minutes. No epinephrine or diphenhydramine was indicated or administered. Patient was observed until approximately 8:30pm, at which time he had made a full recovery.  Patient left under his own power, and safely travelled to his home. Pharmacist called to check on patient and spoke with him twice (4/29, 9:50pm...4/30, 4:30pm). Patient reports feeling fine, no residual effects. Is eager to receive his second dose on 5/20/21.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

When I came upon him his eyes were open and he was able to answer questions. he stated that he did not have any problems breathing, but felt dizzy. He was very clammy so we took his bp and it was 142/65 pulse 64, gave him an ice pack and had him stay laying down. He sat up after awhile and took a few sips of water but started to feel light headed again so we had him lay back down. His bp went down to 105/58 pulse 61, but then came back up to 136/81 pulse 75 as he was starting to feel better. He started to get more color in his face and feel less clammy so I stayed sitting up. We put him in a chair eventually and the EMTs arrived shortly later. They did and evaluation, but as they were talking about whether or not to take him to the hospital he passed out again. The EMTs said he was probably having some anxiety to needles. He then said that he had passed out giving blood once.  They took him to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Approximately three to four minutes after the second dose, he reported feeling dizzy. A few seconds later he lost consciousness with eyes rolled to the back of his head. He was unresponsive to verbal communication or attempts to shake him awake. He then began grunting and struggling for breath. His body began to shake/convulse and he lost control of his bladder. This lasted about five to ten seconds. He regained consciousness and reported that he felt as if he was &#34;dreaming&#34;. He also reported feeling very hot, and had sweat dripping down his face. Paramedics were called to the scene where his vital signs were checked. All signs including temperature were normal. His first dose on /26/21 had an almost exact reaction, minus losing control of bladder, although that time nobody was around to assist him.

His head fell and also his upper limbs stiffened with twisted hands as if it were a convulsion, as if it were a tonic phase. His skin turned white and he didn&#39;t react. I put alcohol gel all over his face and body, then he began to react, little by little his body color returned but he does not remember anything that happened in those minutes.

There was no other apparent cause based on patient&#39;s history.  He was found to have a reduced ejection fraction on echocardiogram as a result of his myocarditis.  He continued to have dyspnea on exertion at discharge.

A 20-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0151), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 15Apr2021, as second dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and allergies to tree nuts and penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate (FLOVENT), salbutamol sulfate (ALBUTEROL), and an unspecified multivitamin. The patient previously took montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) and bacitracin/ neomycin sulfate/ polymyxin B sulfate (TRIPLE ANTIBIOTIC Ointment) and experienced allergies to both; and the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ER8727) on 19Mar2021 at the age of 20 years for COVID-19 immunization (right arm). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. On 15Apr2021, the patient experienced initial anxiety or panic after shot was given. On 16Apr2021 (next day), the patient had fever and fatigue. The second day after (17Apr2021), the patient had shortness of breath and chest tightness. After several trips to the emergency room, the primary care physician (PCP) did laboratory tests that diagnosed an overactive thyroid (17Apr2021). Symptoms still remain and are being treated by an endocrinologist. Treatments included methimazole, lorazepam (ATIVAN), and diltiazem. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office or clinic visit and emergency room or department or urgent care. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient had not recovered from the events.

                                                Experienced mild chest pain two days after vaccination. Visited the ER, and was Hospitalized due to a decreased ejection fraction and elevated cardiac enzymes.  My ejection fraction returned to normal the following day, and I showed a decrease in cardiac enzymes. The pain also subsided about 36hrs after starting. I remained at hospital for a few days to have a cardiac MRI which showed patchy myocarditis. I was discharged that day, and have been taking metoprolol and avoiding physical exertion.  Later, on May 13th I returned to the ER due to an increase in heart palpitations. They turned out to be PVC, which is generally harmless, but I began taking a potassium supplement since my levels were low. I&#39;ve been taking it easy since.  Currently, I am expected to avoid exercise and exertion for six months, but am waiting for a follow-up to get more details.

Unfortunately, study was suboptimal but showed possible subsegmental PE vs mixing defect and consolidation in lingula consistent with pneumonia vs pulmonary infarct from PE.  Scan initially read as more likely pneumonia but patient without consistent symptoms and re-read as concerning for pulmonary embolism.  Patient otherwise healthy without other risk factors for PE.  Repeat CTA 2 weeks later with better quality without e/o PE and improving but not resolved opacity in lingula.  LE dopplers 3 wks after onset w/o DVT.  Hypercoaguable labs pending.

A 20-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 13May2021 at 11:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient is very strict on his health. The patient is a vegetarian, he is very health conscious. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on Apr2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced tenderness at the shot site and was very tired. On the morning of 14May2021, the patient had a small temperature that was one degree higher than before and the patient was wiped out tired-extremely exhausted and tired. Then the patient started experiencing chest pain within days of the second dose. The patient woke up on 15May2021 with chest pain that was persistent through 18May2021. On 19May2021, the chest pain got worse. The reporter thought the patient had indigestion so she gave the patient Tylenol, Pepcid, and clear soda and the patient felt a little better. On 20May2021, the patient was clutching his chest and had pain in his left arm. The patient couldn&#39;t talk, the pain was so hard. The patient went to the emergency room at 12:00 and the healthcare team said that the patient was experiencing a heart attack (reported time of heart attack was 10:00). The patient was not admitted to the hospital. They said the chemical that the large muscle in the heart makes, it was elevated which was how they determined it was a heart attack. These lab numbers were drawn every three hours and they came down but never went away. The patient had two Troponin draws and they were both elevated. They also did an EKG on the patient which showed a heart attack. The patient was told to see a cardiologist and was sent home. The reporter is watching the patient and the patient is still in a little bit of pain but not as much. The patient went to his primary care provider on the day of the report and the doctor doesn&#39;t see this as a displaced issue. The doctor does not know what would cause this in the heart. The patient is to see the cardiologist on Tuesday, 25May2021. The reporter is unsure if this is related to the vaccine but it was almost a week after the patient&#39;s second dose. The outcome of the event small temperature that was one degree higher than before was recovering and the outcome of the event wiped out tired-extremely exhausted and tired was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested

                                                On Friday patient woke up with severe chest pain. He had to be taken to the emergency room. His troponin levels were above 1300 which indicated a heart attack so they admitted him to the hospital overnight. However, the blood work indicated an infection and Ibuprofen was the only medicine that helped with the pain.  While at the hospital a series of tests were done to find out what was going on. Once the patient was stable enough he left the hospital and he is now undergoing more tests and getting his medical records transferred to the doctors here. We are still in the process of finding out the exact issue and will hopefully get some answers soon.

This The reporter reported for a 20-year-old male patient (Reporter&#39;s son) via medical information team.  A 20-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 (20-year-old at the time of vaccination) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included illness from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. He has been to the doctor for sick visits 20 times in 20 years. The reporter also stated that there are no mental health issues noted in their family history. The reporter also stated that the patient was overall healthy with no significant medical history in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter reported that patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on Saturday and by Monday was having flu like symptoms, fevers, chills, diarrhoea, chest pain, shakiness, as well as other neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. He has been to the doctor for sick visits 20 times in 20 years. After receiving the COVID 19 vaccines, the patient has been seen by the doctor 3 times in one week. The patient&#39;s side effects have lasted 3-4 weeks. The reporter would like to know commonly reported side effects of the vaccine and their duration. The reporter would like to know the efficacy of only one dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine as the patient was hesitant to get the 2nd dose due to the side effects noted from the 1st vaccine. The reporter was advised per &#34;attached&#34; dose for efficacy after one dose. The reporter was not satisfied with this data and wanted to know more about what she had been read about online. The reporter was advised caller agent as could do some more research and contact her back with possible additional data which caller agreed to doing. Upon call back on 14Jun2021, advised caller per (website &#34;PRIVACY&#34;) from 10Dec2020. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients began to diverge by 12 days after the first dose, and 52.4% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval: 29.5, 68.4) was observed between dose 1 and dose 2, indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization. Two doses of vaccine provide the maximum protection observed. Ten cases of severe COVID-19 were observed with onset after the first dose. Nine cases occurred among placebo recipients and one among BNT162b2 recipients. The reporter would like to know dosing interval between shot one and two. Patient had their 1st dose on 14May2021 and has not received the 2nd dose yet due to side effects from what they felt was caused by the 1st dose of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. The reporter received response as &#34;you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine if you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if you had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision&#34;. The reporter wanted to know should the patient get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine after the reported side effects of flu like symptoms, fevers, chills, diarrhoea, chest pain, shakiness, as well as other neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. The reporter received response as do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of the events was resolved in 2021  Follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number has been requested

                                                For 2 days he had arm pain and hot flashes. Day 3 he felt better but had some arm cramping. 84 hours after the vaccine he woke with tremors for several hours overnight; he then continue to experience muscle twitching but the tremor resolved the next morning. That day he noticed he felt very fatigued. The twitching and spasms lasted about 3 or 4 days. The legs will still spasm at nighttime and he still feels fatigued with less exercise tolerance. His baseline was 2-3 miles walking without difficulty prior to the vaccine, lately a mile will wipe him out. He also noticed intermittent midline pain around his breastbone that has improved. He hasn&#39;t had any shortness of breath. He had poor circulation to his hands and were cold and white but that resolved. He did not have sensory changes. His symptoms overall have been improving.

Pharmacist on duty instructed the patient to lay down facing up and started taking his blood pressure every 3 mins while giving the patient the electrolyte Vitamin drink( similar to Gatorade). His blood pressure and pulse readings were 100/60 (60), 93/51 (54), 104/62(68); 101/68(62), 108/79(67),109/79(67). So his blood pressure and pusle went down  for 1 reading then it went back to his normal reading of 109/79 within 10 mins. After laying down for 15 mins and drinking vitamin drink, pt felt better as his nausea/dizziness went away. He felt okay and left the pharmacy at 11:30am. Pt reported no reactions to any vaccines before. His girlfriend called the dad to report the incident and the dad told her that his twin brother experienced the same reaction earlier today when receiving his covid vaccine at another site. His brother felt fine after 30 mins monitoring

                                                Pt  20year old male- came to the pharmacy for a walk in  covid vaccine. He filled out the vaccine consent form. I asked him if he was feeling ok today - he said yes. he presented as looking in healthy condition. I then asked him if he has ever had a bad reaction to a vaccine  and he said not that he knew of but that he did not like needles. I told him that was normal, explained the shot was a quick pinch no stinging and would be over before he knew it. I encouraged him to relax his arm muscle and as soon as he did I gave the vaccine. I started to tell him he could take Tylenol or ibuprofen if he should get  a sore arm and to make sure he is drinking plenty of water as hydration helps our bodies- he then asked if he could have some water and then tilted his head back and was passed out for i&#39;d say 4 seconds. I massaged his arm and neck as he became kinda ridged and talked him back. he was out for about 4 seconds. I yelled for our store co manager who happened to be close by to come to the pharmacy and call 911. When he regained consciousness he started to sweat. he said he felt cold and thirsty. I gave him some water to drink. I explained to him what had happened and told him that we had called 911 out of precaution. I discussed with him calling parents and he wanted to call himself - he made the call to his mom on his cell phone to have her come pick him up. EMS arrived in about 10 minutes. they said his blood pressure was really low 100/60 and wanted to take him in but the patient refused. he also refused getting his blood sugar tested as he now told us he was deathly afraid of any medical procedure. ems left. I offered him some more water and chips. he drank 2 full bottles of water and ate a small bag of chips. his mom showed up a few minutes later to drive him home- we explained to her what had happened.. I told her to monitor his blood pressure at home (she said she had a machine)she said she should have known better than to let him come alone as she knew he reacted bad to medical situations. He left about 30 minutes after he got his vaccine. walked out on his own needed no assistance.

A 20-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0178; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left (at the age of 20-years-old) on 02Jun2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date and ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR [SALBUTAMOL SULFATE]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Nurse stated, Initially when he has a dose of the first dose like two three days after he was experiencing, he also had a muscle that was given, he had a muscle injection site was painful, that arm was sore that was given, but he also started experiencing shortness of breath and same left sided chest pressure and I called his pediatrician and that&#39;s why we are just watching him because it wasnt to the point where he was full blown shortness of breath, full blown chest pressure stayed last for a couple of days then getting it worst. But he had the chills, he had fatigue is still there and it started to subside and then couple days after since it subside, fatigue never left but then he started to get chills again and fatigue was even more pronounce and then started more congestion and then he has ear infection, which we took him to doctor 2 days ago and he has started antibiotics. So the whole time from the time he got the dose till now he is been not feeling good, so now with the antibiotics he is feeling a little better and on 04Jun or 05Jun, like Friday to Saturday he was expecting little shortness of breath and then he was having a little bit of left side chest pressure, he had the arm pain initially and the site of injection was really painful and then the fatigue probably started the same time Friday Saturday he just, he didn&#39;t looked good at all, he just looked white. The patient experienced left sided chest pressure (concern of myocarditis), like a chest pain on the left side, shortness of breath, chills on an wasn&#39;t feeling good with joint pain wasn&#39;t feeling good with joint pain/wasn&#39;t feeling good after he received the vaccine; not feeling well; whole time from the time he got the dose till now he is been not feeling good, fatigued/still feeling fatigued on an unspecified date, ear infection on 19Jun2021 and a lot of congestion, muscle injection site was painful, arm was sore; arm pain, the site of injection was really, muscle injection site was painful, arm was sore; arm pain, the site of injection was really painful, he didn&#39;t looked good at all, he just looked white on an unspecified date. The patient was treated with antibiotics for ear infection. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test result: negative. Caller stated His sons next dose (of Pfizer COVID vaccine) is due Wednesday. But until now he has not been feeling good. I don&#39;t want to give him the vaccine when he&#39;s sick. Does that make a difference with the effectiveness if I delay the second dose and she heard people had worse side effects for the first few days with fevers, body aches, nausea, fever and subsided and then they take their 2nd dose and are better after the 2nd dose, also stated her sons symptoms were not acute, but is not sure if it is coincidental if his ear infection was due to the vaccine. The outcome of the events were reported as unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event myocarditis cannot be totally excluded.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

An epi pen was given to the monitor so it would be handy.  The patient&#39;s right hand started shaking within a minute and it was hard to tell if it was from being anxious.  Patient continued to communicate verbally and stated he wanted to use the epi pen.  911 was called by the staff and the staff member with the epi pen took it and the patient out of the main area. Paramedics transported him to the hospital with slight tachycardia and never did administer epi pen while in facility. Patient was always conscious and able to verbally communicate.

This was followed by chest pains.  These chest pains prompted him to seek care in the ER.  Upon workup, I found the patient to have developed myocarditis with a significantly elevated troponin prompting hospitalization.

Another nosebleed occurred on April 3 at around 12:30 pm (this one was a little runny but not gushing, not much blood). Last nosebleed to occur was on April 5 around 3 pm (this one was dried blood). 2 of the nosebleed have been runny (not much blood and not gushing) and the rest have been noticed as dried blood in the nose. Right nostril is bleeding a little more than left nostril in each of the cases.

                                                Felt anxious about the shot and got it at 10:48, started feeling dizzy at around 10:55 during the 10 minute waiting period, then started to black out and I immediately told the nurse who&#39;s quick actions prevented me from fully fainting (laying me down and giving me food/water and elevating my legs). Blood pressure was fine she said along with O2 levels. Left around 11:25 after I felt able to.   We both think this was likely related to the anxiety about getting the shot itself (I have anxiety in general so it was not paired with a mistrust or anything about the vaccine) and began fainting 7 minutes after getting the vaccine. I was anxious about any possible symptoms and needles/shots/blood draws make me feel uneasy. However, this issue was not present with the first shot.

Since he was feeling light-headed, the immunizing pharmacist told me to get the blood pressure cuff. When I got back, the patient passed out. The pharmacist and I moved the chair from underneath him and he gently put him on the floor. He quickly woke up and the pharmacist began to ask him questions such as his name and where he was to make sure he was ok. He was able to answer those questions fine and we placed him in a chair so he can rest. When he was in the chair, he began to pass out again. He quickly woke up again but wasn&#39;t feeling good. The pharmacist checked his blood pressure and it was low. His temperature was at 93F. The pharmacist continued to stay with him and he made sure that someone else was able to come and pick him up. Once he felt ok, he had the patient go sit in the post-vaccination waiting area until he had his ride pick him up.

                                                Patient received vaccine in left arm (deltoid). Was in post vaccination observation area. About 5 minutes after the injection, while sitting in the observation chairs, the patient fainted and hit his head on the floor. Pharmacist and patient&#39;s father got him back up into the chair. Patient quickly regained consciousness, but felt nauseous and warm. Patient was given a little water. But could carry-on a conversation.  Patient vomited a little into a trash can. About 10 additional minutes went by. Patient was able to get up out of the chair and walk out of the facility with the help of his family. Patient had a little bit of bump on head where he had struck the floor, no bleeding occurred. No additional medical assistance was contacted at that time by the facility, family, or the pharmacist. Pharmacist called the patient several hours to after to see how he was doing, but did not get a response. The pharmacist left a voicemail. It is unknown to the pharmacist whether or not the family decided it was necessary to get medical follow-up or not after the incident.

After 1 hour, he took one ibuprofen which resolved symptoms. On 4/27, he again had chest pain but immediately took ibuprofen which resolved symptoms. He saw his PCP on 4/28 and had abnormal EKG with ST and T wave abnormalities, elevated troponin of 10, and he was sent to the ED for further evaluation. He was given 324mg aspirin and admitted for observation. He did not have any additional symptoms, and echo was normal. Troponins down trended to 2 by 4/29, and he was discharged on a 5 day course of indomethacin with follow up with his PCP, no cardiology follow up required.

He felt throat tightness made it hard to breath, he had associated lightheadedness, felt anxious, almost like a wheezing sound when breathed in and out in his upper neck. When he stood up, he did feel like he needed to hold onto something to steady himself, had some tunnel vision, improved with sitting down and closing his yes and taking deep breaths. He felt warm at the time, not cold or clammy. His friend said he looked ghostly white, no flushing, no hives, no angioedema. No sense of impending doom. He did take Zyrtec the day that he received the vaccine.   He waited the 15 minutes after vaccine without symptoms, and had walked back to class by the time it started. Between the vaccine and symptoms onset, he denies eating anything, being stung by anything.   He told a friend about his symptoms, and he returned to the hospital via base taxi arrived at ER. Symptoms were still occurring about 60 minutes after vaccination when he arrived at the ER. In the ER, he underwent exam, was given oral Benadryl.  His symptoms of scratchy throat lasted for 2 days afterwards with some associated fatigue, post-nasal drip.  He denies other symptoms. No fevers or chills. Small amount of pain and a ?knot? at the injection site the next day, but minimal according to the paitent.   Denies hives, angioedema, SOB, wheezing, nausea/vomiting, no diarrhea, abdominal pain, nasal pruritus/congestion, ocuarl itching/redness, no syncope.   No h/o vaccine reactions before. No h/o passing out before at all, specifically not to needles, blood draws, or vaccines before.   No h/o venom or drug allergy. He does report a history of apple allergic reaction 1 year previous when eating a raw apple, felt his throat close within 15-30 minutes, no hives or other systemic symptoms. He took oral Benadryl and went to ER. He was given oral Benadryl, no Epipen. He followed up with his PCM regarding possible apple allergy and was told to avoid apples, but was never tested for apple allergy. Since then, when he drinks apple juice, his throat will start hurting, but otherwise, he has avoided raw and cooked allergies. He does report seasonal rhinitis symptoms that are worse in the fall. He takes allegra as needed to treat these symptoms. He is not carrying an Epipen currently

                                                Patient is a 21 y.o. male with no past medical history who got his second dose of COVID (Pfizer) vaccine on Saturday presented with chest pain since Sunday. Patient says that he was in his USOH until yesterday when he started having substernal chest pain which was getting worse with inspiration but also with specific movements. He does have pain even at rest sometimes but he thinks that it&#39;s exacerbating by breathing. Had some nausea/vomiting as well. Denies other symptoms. Not really sob or leg swelling.    In the ER, his Trop I was 10.7 and his WBC was 12.2. His EKG was NSR with short PR and STE I, II, III, AVF, V4-V6  Patient is a 21 y.o. male with no past medical history who got his second dose of COVID (Pfizer) vaccine on Saturday presented with chest pain since Sunday with some pleuritic characteristics. He was found to have a very elevated trop I to 10.7, leukocytosis to 12.2 and STE in I, II, III, AVF, V4-V6. His POCUS in the ER was without significant pericardial effusion and probably normal EF. Differential at this point includes pericarditis vs myopericarditis (there are some myocarditis cases reported in Israel post Pfizer vaccination, predominantly in young male patients) vs less likely ACS. Will need admission and further work up and treatment        -Admission to Cardiology -NPO in case team tomorrow decides to proceed to LHC  -Full echo and cardiac MRI tomorrow  -Telemetry monitoring  -Repeat EKG q4h overnight  -send CRP, ESR -trend Trop to peak  -would not start heparin gtt at this point  -Please start tonight ASA 650 TID &#43; Colchicine 0.6 mg BID   21-year-old man admitted with signs and symptoms of acute myo-pericarditis or in the setting of recent COVID-19 vaccination.  He apparently had the findings are vaccine 2 days ago and developed pleuritic chest pain.  His ECG shows pathognomonic changes for pericarditis in the is a small troponin elevation.  He has no past medical history or exertional symptoms to suggest CAD.  Bedside echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular systolic function.  He was admitted and placed on aspirin and colchicine.  A cardiac MRI today showed evidence of myopericarditis.  He had 3 beats of nonsustained VT on tele.

Patients nose  was bleeding. A rapid response was called. Patient was placed in a wheelchair and taken to  the ER.Patient  normal vitals on presentation. Not acutely toxic appearing.  Exam with mild ecchymoses along the left maxilla and along the left neck  concerning for possible head injury. EKG shows sinus bradycardia. Head CT shows  no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. It does note a posterior left  orbital floor fracture with blood in the left maxillary sinus. He has no evidence  of visual acuity changes or visual complaints. No signs of entrapment. Feel he is  stable for discharge at this time. I spoke with on-call ophthalmology, doctor. He states that the patient walk-in tomorrow for follow-up.

                                                my son was on a strenuous bicycle trip and reached his campground for the night. in the late evening he called me to report that he was suffering from nausea and rapid heartbeat (tachycardia). we assumed this was caused by heat exhaustion, but later I saw news reports about myocarditis being investigated as a possible side effect from the Covid-19 vaccine. my son fits the rough profile (young man) and experienced these symptoms three days after his second vaccination, so I thought this should be reported. He completed his bike trip (200 miles) and feels fine after taking one day to rest.

                                                Pericarditis diagnosis:  This is a 21 year old male who presented to the emergency department on 4/27/21 with a two-day history of chest pain.  He was seen in a  emergency department on 4/26 and reported a normal EKG, blood work, and x-ray.  He was discharged home.  His was worsened so he reported to an urgent care in .  That team had a concern for pericarditis, so referred the patient to the  emergency room.  He had a reproducible pain over the costal margin but did describe a positional component.  Provider felt they still had to consider pericarditis as well as costochondritis.  The suspicion for pulmonary embolism or acute coronary syndrome or very low.  The suspicion also for myocarditis was low.  His EKG did show some J-point elevation versus ST elevation in the anterior and lateral leads.  There was no evidence of reciprocal depression.  His troponin test was normal.  His CBC and metabolic panel were normal.  He had had CRP which was mildly elevated at 4.6. A bedside point-of-care ultrasound showed no evidence of a pericardial effusion.  Provider felt it was reasonable to treat him for pericarditis although his EKG is not classic for this.  It was recommended he use his scheduled ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times a day.  He was also given a 1 month course of daily colchicine 0.6 mg. It was recommend he follow closely with his PCP to see if he needs to have this colchicine course extended.  He will follow-up with his primary doctor in 1 week for repeat check.

It felt as though my heart were beating too quickly (ended up being around 160-180 BPM), and felt like it was affecting my entire body.   Not sure if this was vaccine-related, but after seeing myocarditis events wanted to share in case of more data being needed.

                                                Overnight after shot just typical symptoms, some slight chills and next day just a little tired Day 2 after shot, April 11th.  Chest pain, squeezing in chest. Unusual but manageable and didn?t feel terrible otherwise,maybe slightly tired.  Tried leaning forward to make feel better.  Day 3 and 4 chest pain/heart squeezing continued and was bothersome and, went to Urgent Care this day  April 13th. EKG was a little abnormal and told to follow up with a cardiologist and take Advil.  The heart squeezing feeling continued.  Early morning hours April 14th very sick, excessive shaking (no fever), extreme nausea, faint feeling, dry cough (laying on bathroom floor).  Not much, if any chest pain at the time.  Went to ER.  Not much chest pain during ER visit but nauseous and shaking etc. Test were run.   Told that the symptoms were a delayed reaction to the vaccine and to follow up with a cardiologist because possible abnormal EKG and to take Advil as needed.  Overnight at home, no chest pain but an hour of the shaking and nausea returned but not as bad as before.  Over next couple days the chest pain/squeezing, slightly shakes and  light headedness would come and go and by 4-16 feeling pretty great.  The heart feeling mildly at most in the background but not debilitating.  Starting week of April 20th maybe 4-5 flare ups with chest pain and no pattern but not debilitating.  Could happen at rest.  April 27th bigger flare up more debilitating, had to lie down, heart squeezing  pain and maybe some wheezing when breathed in but not tightness in throat.  Lasted about 30 minutes.  Was just doing schoolwork with friends at the time so not under any physical or emotional stress at the time.  After this from April 20 to May 3rd feeling heart symptom mildly but not debilitating and could resume normal active life.  Had cardiology appt. May 3rd with nurse practitioner.  According to NP the 12 Lead EKG run that day correlated with abnormal EKG from ER.  Normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia Rightward axis Pulmonary disease pattern.  Incomplete right bundle branch block Abnormal ECG.  Given 4 lead heart monitor to wear for a week.  Also ordered a CV CT angiogram coronaries with calcium scoring.  The test could not be scheduled through them until July.  Also told could go on hiking trip out west and to stop and rest if felt pain.  For parents reassurance about hiking trip, had a second opinion over teleconference call with Dr., myocarditis specialist to confirm would be safe on hiking trip. Dr. said he should be good to go.  He said these heart symptoms related to the second vaccine could fade over time.  Hiking trip May 20th to May 30th.  Did fine with exertion and just a few small episodes of the chest pain, light headedness and maybe a little shaking but these were at rest.  Also, 4 lead heart monitor report was good.  Returned from trip May 30th and no chest pain or symptoms for approximately 3 weeks through June 17th.   June 18th went to urgent care for sore throat and ear.  Prescribed amoxycillin.  Took the amoxycillin and one Advil sinus, that evening had a heart squeezing episode return.  This was the first time in almost 3 weeks.  Did not take any more Advil sinus in case that caused the episode. Had another slight episode that evening.  Hiked next day June 19th and fine.  Then felt it slightly again after eating that afternoon of the 19th, also chest did feel a little tight all day.  Then felt it again that evening.  Still taking Amoxycillin as of today.

Afterwards, he developed myalgia and chest pain that began on 17JUN21, which worsened prompting his arrival to ED. His troponin was found to be elevated and there were non-specific ST elevations on his electrocardiogram so he was admitted for observation while starting colchicine for myocarditis. His chest pain resolved in the emergency department prior to admission and did not return during his stay. His troponin peaked and down-trended. The findings on his electrocardiogram resolved. A formal echocardiogram was performed on 21JUN21 with no significant findings. He is to continue on colchicine 0.6mg PO BID for 3 months (END 8/11/21) and then follow up with cardiology for possible further workup if needed.

                                                A couple of days later, I experienced what I can best describe as a &#34;fluttering heart.&#34; Beginning around noon two days after my first COVID vaccine was administered, I began to feel a high heart rate and heart palpitations. Later that evening and into the night, I experienced low blood pressure (i.e., 104/55) for an extended period and my oxygen levels dropped to the low 90s--this concerned me because I am a healthy athlete and play a cardio-intensive sport. These symptoms worsened while I laid down to go to sleep and continued for a couple of days. After my second vaccine, however, these symptoms did not appear with the same severity; rather, they were very mild.

I have no stamina at all, just slight exertion causes my heart to start racing and pounding, I can&#39;t climb stairs and I haven&#39;t been able to work in weeks, now I&#39;m probably going to lose my job I fear and then will have no health insurance. I have more tests this week to try and find out if I have endocarditis, so I am racking up all kinds of bills. So far no one believes me or will help me! ALL of this started within a few days of the second Pfizer dose of COVID vaccine. Biggest mistake of my life. I feel like I&#39;m dying and no one will help. You are literally killing me.

She also gave him a wet rag to wipe his forehead. He was given two teaspoonful of Benadryl 12.5mg/ 5ml. The patient stated that he was feeling dizzy and thought he was going to faint. The pharmacy called 911. The patient removed his jacket and mask as he was hot. The EMT arrived and walked him outside* I am not sure what happened after that

Pharmacist immediately got red immunization emergency bag and approached patient.  I introduced myself  and prepared to activate the emergency response system (as recommended during CPR) but he had good pulse and respiration and immediately he spontaneously recovered!   We asked him to stay to be observed and offered him some water and food.  He accepted the water.   We did a wellness check phone call with him later in the afternoon to confirm that he was doing well, and he was.

Additional information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the known vaccine safety profile the causal association between the reported event patient appears to have developed acute myopericarditis within 3 days of receiving the vaccine and the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 is unlikely but cannot be completely excluded because of strong temporal association between the event and the suspected vaccine. The case will be assessed once the new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Felt fine day of vaccine, Sunday, just minor arm pain. Woke up the next morning with pretty severe fatigue and more arm pain. Around 11am I had pretty bad chills that lasted about an hour, along with minor nausea. Additionally,  throughout most of the day my heart rate was usually between 90-100 bpm, even while lying down and doing nothing.  Going to sleep on Monday night I woke around 3 times during the night with cold sweats. Waking up on Tuesday morning, my heart rate is still elevated, arm is still sore, but the fatigue isn&#39;t as bad. However, at around 9am on Tuesday morning I started to develop itchy hives and a rash on the back of my legs.  After the first dose I only had a sore arm, no symptoms like these, and I do not have any known allergies.

                                                Approximately five days after receiving the vaccine, I had a strange feeling in the left side of my chest as if something was swollen. It was not pain, but rather a feeling as if something inside was &#34;enlarged&#34; or heavy. Shortly after, I also had sharp pains on the left side which would come once or twice a day and last 1-2 seconds at most. As of now (day 13), I either do not feel the heaviness anymore or I am not noticing it anymore. The sharp pains have become very infrequent but I do often feel a mild soreness in the left side of my chest which lasts for about half an hour and gradually subsides.

A 22-years-old male patient (Son) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. My son is having a tough time with the vaccine. Everyday he has a couple of side effects. He started with body ache and tiredness on unspecified date Apr2021. He had a pounding headache. His headache was moderate today. However, the headache symptoms are getting worst. Generally, the symptoms last a day his have been getting worst for 7 days. He has been taking Tylenol and Advil. But the Advil doesn&#39;t even seem to hep anymore.&#34; headache is a common side effect reported with the vaccine. If the symptoms persists or get worst please consult your HCP. Please note blood clot has not been associated with the vaccine. Patient is been experiencing what I considered to be pretty severe, I guess reaction in term of aches and headache. This morning he woke up with the pounding headache, he kid described it as pounding and I just I guess I want to ask because everywhere I read, it says mild headaches are common and aches and I understand that but I guess understanding why this, this is considered somewhat as severe reaction or is there anything he can do to alleviate the symptom and should he, I guess my question is actually I guess my question also is should he not possibly get the second dose if he is experiencing such bad headaches with the first dose. When paraphrased the concern, reporter stated, Yes, basically we are thinking if can do to alleviate it and then he could not get the second dose, if you have any advice, I guess and just let you know he went to his health center in the college he went to get a COVID test and a flu test just to make sure he doesn&#39;t have actual Covid or flu and those report I got yesterday and so they told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. When probed for event start date, reporter stated, I would say a day after, I would say 09Apr2021, I guess it&#39;s phantom (not clarified) with symptom, the first day he was just tired, as far as the headache that started on the 09Apr2021. He (son) also passed out after the vaccine, which I also did that I didn&#39;t have Pfizer I (reporter) had Moderna and I had that same reaction, so I think that sometimes happens to some people but that&#39;s it happens also. When probed for vaccination anatomical site, reporter stated, Outside of the body I guess, I don&#39;t know that for sure. Patient still having the problem (event), and out event outcome, reporter stated, Yes, I think persisting, I think it varies. Patient has been taking Advil (Ibuprofen) and Tylenol (treatment). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included influenza virus test: negative on 12Apr2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 12Apr2021. They told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of body ache (pain), tiredness (fatigue), pounding headache/headache symptoms are getting worst (headache). The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  QR Comment: Call handler not filed split case. Might have been split case.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                A few days after being vaccinated, I had experienced dizziness, fainting while at physical therapy. When laid on the table, I noticed I had tightness in my chest, like I couldn&#39;t catch my breath. They took my blood pressure, and It was 136/88 pulse rate of 88. These issues continued to persist. I went to the doctors to discuss the issue with a PA. She took an EKG, and found no abnormalities, although I wasn&#39;t having an episode at the time. I later felt palpitations in my chest. (my heart would race spontaneously at times for no longer than a few seconds.) The PA as well as my Doctor, had confirmed I had high blood pressure.  I began to eat healthier and lose weight in order to change the blood pressure issues. The first appointment, I was 284. The second appointment which was in late April, I was 264, and my blood pressure was in the mid 120&#39;s over upper 70&#39;s, with my pulse rate in the 70&#39;s. The most recent appointment, I became more liberal with my diet and gained weight, weighing 268, but my heart rate continued to lower to a normal point, regardless (low 120&#39;s over 68, Pulse rate in the 60&#39;s.) Dr. and I had discussed possible causes, and I still have a cardiology appointment to follow up with, and we agreed that with the recent notice of myocarditis in vaccinated young adults and kids, it&#39;s a strong possibility the vaccine may have caused my issues, although I am to follow through with the cardiologist to confirm these suspicions.

                                                Chest Pain, Myopericarditis; From EPIC: From cardiologist healthy man who comes to the ER with left anterior chest discomfort for the last 36 hours or so.  Symptoms are made worse by deep inspiration.  Were improved following self administration of 600 mg of ibuprofen earlier today.  2 days ago he received his second COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer).  Following day he experienced arm pain muscular aches and pains severe discomfort of the right arm (injection site) later in the day there was nausea and vomiting on one occasion (nonheme).  By last night he was able to eat dinner but subsequently felt short of breath with worsening chest discomfort morning the left arm continued to ache with musculoskeletal pains.  Developed more discomfort in the left anterior chest radiating to the throat made worse by deep inspiration. Does not describe typical sharp catching pain of pericarditis.  No cough sputum bruising bleeding abdominal pain change in color or character of bowels.  Sign in the emergency room he was hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm with a normal EKG.Torrey work-up notable for an initial troponin of 1.28 and a follow-up troponin of 2.14. Chest x-ray perfectly normal. Elevated d-dimer. CT angiography negative for pulmonary embolism vascular injury, cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion but the radiologist did note thickening of several right posterior and lateral axillary lymph nodes raising a question of recent right-sided vaccination or injury/infection to the right arm. Presently he is perfectly comfortable able to take a deep inspiration with mild chest discomfort, breathing easily.  I met him in July 2018He came to the emergency room with a 3-day viral syndrome manifested as headache nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal discomfort and then developed chest discomfort.  He was found with diffuse mild J-point elevation on EKG consistent with a viral type pericarditis with troponins which rose to a maximum of 10.4.  Work-up for myocarditis was negative.  Echocardiogram perfectly normal.  Symptoms responded to a course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine.  Seen in follow-up of repeat echocardiogram was perfectly healthy.  Our diagnosis was myopericarditis. There is no history of shortness of breath dyspnea on exertion decrement of exercise capacity peripheral edema orthopnea PND palpitations lightheadedness syncope or collapse.  No ill contacts.  He works in a high security position and therefore qualified for early administration of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  Graph past medical history notable only for the episode of myopericarditis and a remote tonsillectomy. There is no significant family history of sudden cardiac death or unusual heart disease. He takes no medications. Patient was recommended to take 4 weeks of ibuprofen and colchicine if needed for worsening chest pain.  Patient was recommended to follow-up closely with his primary care doctor and check ESR, C-reactive protein as well as renal function.  Needs close follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.

                                                There was a thumping and tightness in my chest centered around my heart, as well as pain in my left arm that traveled, fulfilling the textbook definition of a heart attack. I went to the ER, got an EKG and it looked normal. The tightness lasted for the next few days, and occasionally persists to today (March 27th). After two blood tests, X ray, and blood pressure they determined my troponin levels were not only measurable, they were increasing, so I was admitted to the hospital. I was given aspirin for 30 days, and told to leave caffeine alone for that time, but I was cleared of the daily aspirin doses and allowed to consume caffeine again after approximately two weeks. Furthermore, I was prescribed nitroglycerin pills incase it should happen again. Doctors concluded that one of my heart valves had a spasm, triggering the event.

                                                Reason for Admission  Patient 22-year-old male with a history of seasonal allergic asthma who presented to ER with a chief complaint of chest pain.  He said he started having multiple episodes of vomiting/fever on Saturday morning, went to urgent care and diagnosed with sinus infection,  prescribed amoxicillin, then  he started having chest pain on Sunday at 4 PM, mid sternum, constant, pressure type of pain, 5 out of 10 in severity, worse with cough and deep breathing/lying down flat a lateral position, better with sitting up/ leaning forward.  No radiation.  Denies lifting any heavy weight or any heavy exercise.  Never had similar symptoms in the past.  He had his second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on May 12.  He denies leg pain or swelling.  His vomiting and fever resolved.   ED: He was found to have troponin of more than 12,000, EKG showed diffuse ST segment elevation with possible repolarization.   Transferred for possible cardiac cath/cardiac MRI.  CT angio chest no PE, normal aorta, no infiltration.  Pending second set of troponin, stat echo, aspirin po  given in the ER.   In addition to the above HPI, he reports having 2 days of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  T-max 103F.  His chest pain began around 4 PM yesterday and he felt like it was initially consistent with his asthma, however it did not improve so around 1:30 AM he states they went to the ER.  He states that the chest pain gets better with exertion, and is worse with deep breaths and lying on his side, or leaning forward. He did take Nyquil decongestant which contains phenylephrine.     Hospital Course   22 yo M w/PMH exercise induced asthma admitted for evaluation of CP, elevated troponin to 21,292 with negative LHC. UDS Negative. EKG w/diffuse ST changes so consistent with Myopericarditis I31.9 given Recent Viral Illness resulting in first time myopericarditis, will treat per pericarditis algorithm, ASA&#43;Colchicine w/90% response rate by 1 week.     -ASA 650 to 1000 mg TID, weekly tapers if CRP normalized and sx free; will start at 650 mg dose   -Colchicine 0.6 mg BID for 3 months, no taper (lowers recurrence rate, NNT = 5)   -Glucocorticoid generally not indicated in first-time acute myopericarditis as observational studies suggest increased recurrence rate, but can consider if he does not adequately respond to aspirin and colchicine   -Trend troponin to ensure downtrend continues   -No strenuous exercise during recovery period

                                                Within minutes of receiving  covid-19  vaccine, I became very  excessive sweaty (my shirt was wet), felt eyesight was dimming,  space perception was completely off, very pale,  dizziness  and unable to hear when being spoken too, felt faint. Both of my arms had a very tingly feeling and felt  heavy  and then became completely  numb and I was unable to move to either arm for approximately 45 minutes.  Movement slowly came back  throughout the evening and over the next week. My legs felt tingly and heavy. I continue to have periodic tingly feeling in my joints through out my body. My chest felt heavy.  I felt like I was doing to die.  Large red swollen area where shot was given. I have COVID 19 in Feb, 2021. Health care profession suspects the reaction may have been related to having COVID-19, second dose not recommended. Likely to have antibodies. I have not felt 100 percent since receiving vaccine.

Trop elevated to 12.7 and ECG with diffuse ST segment elevation consistent with pericarditis. He had an episode of NSVT. Trop peak 29. Patient was started on ASA &#43; colchicine and metoprolol. TTE revealed LVEF 49% with multiple segmental abnormalities. Due to concern for worsening arrhythmia and possible need for myocardial biopsy patient was transferred to BMMC on 5/23.    Cardiology was consulted and cardiac MRI was performed. No further arrhythmias noted on telemetry monitoring. Cardiac MRI revealed LVEF 57% RVEF 53%, no vasodilator induced perfusion defect, delayed enhancement MRI is abnormal, epicardial enhancement of distal anterior and anterolateral walls with small pericardial effusion, consistent with perimyocarditis. Patient chest pain resolved and he denied other associated symptoms.Ttroponin level down to 5, VSS.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) and a contactable other healthcare professional. This consumer reported similar events for two patients (twins). This is the first of two reports.  A 22-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 26Apr2021 10:00 (at the age of 22-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included ongoing rare metabolic disorder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735) received at age 22 years, on 05Apr2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. On 26Apr2021, the patient received the second dose of BNT162B2. In the evening of the same day, 26Apr2021, the patient experienced tiredness/fatigue, and headache. In the morning of 27Apr2021, the patient was feeling really crappy and they though it was like the flu and it would pass. In the evening of 27Apr2021, the patient didn&#39;t sleep at all and was uncomfortable all night and pain. On the same day, 27Apr2021, the patient had severe chest pain, chest tightness, and lightheadedness. On 28Apr2021, the pain didn&#39;t go away, and the twins had elevated ST evaluation on the EKG (electrocardiograph). ST evaluation was done by the reporter&#39;s husband who is a retired firefighter emergency medical technician. The reporter decided to take the patient to hospital and said that the other twin had the same symptoms but kept saying his wasn&#39;t as bad as his brother&#39;s because he did not want to go to the hospital. The doctor advised the reporter to bring the other twin. The twins had the same echo cardiogram on 28Apr2021 (unknown results). On 28Apr2021, their troponin levels were elevated, and their cardiac enzymes continued to go up. On the same day, 28Apr2021, the patient had a strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe. It was reported that the twins were hospitalized on 28Apr2021 with myocarditis/pericarditis and inflammation around the heart. Treatment for myocarditis/pericarditis included ibuprofen and colchicine; and Toradol for breakthrough pain. The reporter stated that the twins are two identical males with the same DNA, had the vaccine at the same time, had the reactions at the same length of time, have the same lifestyle and live at the same house. The reporter said it would go a long way if they help her understand the complication. The patient recovered &#34;strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe&#34; on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the event myocarditis and pericarditis/inflammation around the heart was not recovered.  Follow-up (14May2021): New information received from a contactable other healthcare professional includes: reporter details (other hcp added as a new reporter).  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

                                                Patient experienced Myocarditis-like symptoms beginning 05/20/2021, 3 days after Dose 2 vaccination.  See Continuation Page for Item 18 information details. Additional information for Item 18:   Day 1 (5/18) Patient had typical dose 2 reactions of low fever (100-101 degF), headache, soreness at injection site, mild dizziness.  Day 2 (5/19) he felt much better.  On Day 3 (20 May 2021 9:00AM) Patient experienced notable chest pain (level 5-6 on scale of 10) lasting about 30 minutes.  Pain then decreased to level 1-2 for the next several hours.  Patient said this felt exactly like the pain he experienced when he had Myocarditis in Nov 2017, only less severe.  (The 2017 event required 4 days of hospitalization and temporarily left patient with heart failure in one ventricle (Ejection Fraction &lt;40%) although EJ returned to normal after a few months).  patient was seeing his Primary Care Physician on another matter later this same morning (5/20) and mentioned the pain.  PCP listened to his heart and did not note any irregularities. Patient had no additional pain episodes for the next 3 days so we did not worry.  But daily chest pain episodes resumed 5/24, 1 to 3 times a day,  mostly level 1-2, sometimes level 3, typically lasting 30 min to 2 hrs, through 6/3.  From 6/4 and on episodes have been less frequent.   On 5/25 patient contacted his 2017 Cardiologist who ordered a Troponin-I lab.  Labs were done 5/26 and were normal so we were advised to monitor but go to the ER if severe chest pain occurred.  Patient has an office visit scheduled with his Cardiologist July 2.  As of 6/12 (date of report) episodes tend to occur after moderate physical activity but clear after rest.  This pattern is similar to what patient experienced during the first 3 months following his 2017 illness.  Accordingly patient has reduced his physical activity, using chest pain episodes as an indicator of too much activity.  The 2017 illness appeared to be completely resolved after April 2018 with normal ECG, Echo, EJ and no further reports of chest pain even with normal activity levels.  May 20, 2021 was the first time this type of chest pain reoccurred.

                                                This is a 22-year-old male without significant past medical history presenting with several days of chest pressure after coronavirus vaccination.  His vital signs are stable and he was afebrile upon arrival to the ED with a benign and reassuring physical examination.  His initial EKG does show some diffuse ST segment elevation/PR depression that was not as impressive on a repeat EKG.  Bedside point-of-care echocardiogram shows grossly normal function without obvious pericardial effusion or other acute abnormalities.  Chest x-ray unremarkable.  Laboratory work-up with undetectable troponin and normal BNP.  Incidentally patient was found to have elevated ALT and AST although he is not having any gastrointestinal symptoms.  On repeat history is not had any recent travel or risk factors for hepatitis.  He has not been taking significant amount of acetaminophen at home.  We did obtain a hepatitis panel which did not show evidence of acute infection.  Acetaminophen level was negative.  Mono and coronavirus test were negative.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound was unremarkable.  At this time I do suspect that he may have pericarditis as the underlying cause of his chest discomfort, likely in the setting of a recent coronavirus vaccination.  He does not have evidence of ACS, PE, pneumonia, pneumothorax, life-threatening arrhythmia, or other immediate life threat.  Regarding his transaminitis, he does not have evidence of choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, acute viral hepatitis, or other acutely emergent pathology.  We will discharge him home at this time with a prescription for high-dose ibuprofen as well as extremely strict return precautions instructions to follow close with his primary care provider.  He was specifically instructed that he needs to have repeat transaminases drawn within the next several days to week and that if he has not heard from his primary care provider by Friday morning he should call his primary care provider&#39;s office or walk-in to sick call directly.  He is agreeable with this plan and all of his questions and concerns were addressed prior to discharge.

                                                The side effects didn&#39;t all occur simultaneously. Friday evening I noticed severe arm soreness. Later Friday night (about 10 hours after getting the vaccine) I developed gradual onset chills, body aches, and fatigue. Saturday I woke up with a severe headache, body aches, fatigue, and fever. The headache became severe by mid-day, with fatigue also worsening throughout the day.  Sunday was more of the same, though I believe the fever started inching down and the headache lessened. What developed Sunday afternoon/evening took me off guard though. I noticed a sudden drop in heart rate, a feeling of pressure and discomfort in the chest, nausea, and shortness of breath with exertion (consistently - not just once). (I&#39;m a long-distance runner, so this is unusual for me.) At first I debated going to the emergency room, but since I&#39;m so young and in otherwise good condition I thought nothing of it. I had similar symptoms the following day, but I avoided exerting myself until all of my symptoms from the vaccine had ended. I felt groggy and fatigued for several additional days, but by Saturday (8 days after getting the first dose of Pfizer) everything had resolved. I also developed swollen lymph nodes, which returned to normal size within about 3 weeks (before swelling again after the second vaccine).  The second dose of the vaccine caused a more sudden and intense reaction, though I never developed chest pain/slow heart rate with it.  Instead I developed sudden onset severe chills, fatigue, and body aches about 9 hours after getting the shot. A fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and sudden onset fever (temperature jumped nearly five degrees in about 90 minutes) quickly followed. My fever stabilized around 102.2 around 3 a.m. that morning, and slowly crept down throughout the afternoon/evening. Overall, with dizziness, body aches, extreme fatigue, etc., this was the sickest I&#39;ve been since I had a severe case of the Flu in high school. The fatigue, shortness of breath, and fast heart rate continued for about a week - getting slightly better each day.

It would go away but then come back at random times. At worst this would happen 10&#43; times a day. The symptoms had subsided almost entirely by 4/15/2021, however, I still experience much shorter variations of this pain to this day that only last a few seconds and occur about once a week.

Patient then appeared extremely sweaty and dizzy. He did state he was nervous about receiving the vaccine before coming in and was slightly dehydrated. He also denied paramedic services.  I provided a space for patient to elevate his feet, an ice pack/wet towel and water. Patient then reported losing feeling in fingers and left arm. He denied having trouble breathing and was able to lift his arms.  After ~15 - 20 minutes, patient stated he felt fine. I had patient sit for an extra 15 minutes to ensure he was fine then patient left with his SO. A phone call will be made tomorrow to check in on patient.

                                                Approximately two weeks after receiving the second dose I began to notice abdominal pain that worsened when breathing or laying down. The pain became more severe over the course of the next few days that I admitted myself to the emergency room of the  Hospital. A CT scan showed a pulmonary embolism located in my lower right-hand lung, which would have killed me if left untreated. I was admitted to the hospital and treated for pain and given intravenous blood thinners for 3-4 days. I was discharged with orders to follow up with a pulmonologist, cardiologist, and PCP. I was unable to schedule visits with the specialists due to financial constraints. After leaving the hospital my condition began to improve and has continued to improve since. As I understand it, the tissue in my lung may never heal and as a result i suffer diminished lung capacity.

I just need some sugar like juice.&#34; He denied difficulty breathing or chest pain. He was not nauseous nor did he vomit. I transported him to a private holding room via wheelchair and gave him a 12 oz can of Coca-Cola. He took sips and immediately reported feeling better. The initial vital signs I took were as follows: Temp 98.6 F, HR 67, BP 84/48 mmHg, RR 24/min, and SpO2 97%.  After recheck in 15 min BP improved to 106/62 mmHg, his became more pink and no more diaphoresis. I observed him for 30 minutes total and he was stable to go home. He drove himself home.

                                                After giving the patient his Covid Vaccine, he tensed up and said he was feeling like he may vomit. He then became very pale and fainted while in the vaccination chair. After a few seconds he regained consciousness. We then helped him to the floor and elevated his legs and placed a cold pack on his neck. He started feeling better instantly but we kept him there for about 5 minutes. We then had him move to a chair and the technician sat with him for an additional 40 minutes. He then said he was fine and that he has fainted before (which was not disclosed) and left.

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EN6206) single dose, in the left arm, on 08Mar2021, at 11:45 AM, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had not received any other medications within 2 weeks. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not experienced COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Mar2021, at 12:00 PM, 5 minutes after vaccination, the patient became very light-headed. In a few seconds his vision went dark and he passed out. After an unknown amount of time, he became semiconscious and was hyperventilating. While hyperventilating, his eyes were open, but he could not see anything. Once he caught his breath, after about 15 seconds, his vision came back and he lost all awareness of where he was. After about 30 seconds, the patient realized he was in the observation area for the facility and alerted the medical professionals near his vehicle he was sitting in. Medical professionals checked his vitals, which were fine other than an elevated heart rate, and he had a tingling sensation over his body for the next two minutes. In this time, he was unable to form cohesive sentences, and his muscles movements were impeded. It took another 40 minutes to return to a relatively normal state. No treatment was received. The patient recovered from the adverse events. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Was on the verge of a panic attack but was able to calm down. For the rest of the day I felt anxiety, slight chest pressure and measered a blood pressure of 153/88. The day after I went to to urgent care jsut to check if anything was wrong. My blood pressure was elevated during this visit with a mesaurement of 134/79. Was told that for the next shot to tell the vaccine staff about my reaction and to wait for 30 min instead fo 15 min.

                                                Rash developed on thigh about 2 weeks after the 1st Pfizer vaccine; NOTHING else in life is novel, ie, no new foods, detergents, soaps; no traveling, no guests, and the patient abhors the outdoors so insect involvement is extremely unlikely. Rash was reported to me (Mom) on Thursday, April 1st. There was one spot/lesion that was oval and larger than the others, with a somewhat blanched center.  No itch or pain. Friday the 2nd, patient reported around 5:00 p.m. that it had spread to his sides, so I called the nurse healthline.. Saturday a.m. per recommendation I took him to Urgent Care; it had by then also spread to his stomach. The doctor there didn&#39;t have any &#34;A-HA!!&#34; moment, but sent us off with a prescription for a clotrimazole/betamethasone topical cream. The rash is now heavily populating his stomach, is on his back and there are a couple spots on his arm. I contacted his primary care manager this morning as we are to receive our 2nd Pfizer vaccines day after tomorrow (Wed, 4/7) and I&#39;m wondering if he should get his as planned or whether that might be a bad idea.

Response by staff was great: laid me down, brought a cot, regularly checked my heart rate, blood oxygen, and blood pressure until it returned to normal and waited to make sure the symptoms did not return.   Later that night, I started experiencing some of the typical COVID vaccine side effects: sore arm, chills, nausea, and fever-like symptoms; in addition to the symptoms I was warned was possible, I also experienced periods of dizziness and an uncomfortable sense of balance. Three days later, the dizziness and other common symptoms have gone away, but my sense of balance still feels off, although I do not know if related to the vaccine. It?s not so bad that I?m at risk of falling over, but I have a semi-regular feeling of unsteadiness which I cannot explain.

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

                                                On Saturday night (4/10) I had some chest pains that seemed to not go away in my upper left chest and left arm. I tried to sleep it off until the pain was unbearable at around 7:00 am on Monday (4/11). I then admitted myself to the ER and was given an ECG and multiple EKG?s as well. Upon lab results I had high triponin levels (28) leading the doctors to believe I had a heard attack of some sort, eventually they ruled it as acute pericarditis possibly due to my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

A 23-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 22Apr2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included being a smoker (he vapes). The patient&#39;s sister has Addison&#39;s disease. There were no concomitant medications; no additional vaccines administered on the same date as BNT162B2 and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient previously received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EB8733) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 01Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 22Apr2021 at 14:00. He woke up on 23Apr2021 and felt like he had sinus pressure, then he blew his nose and had a bit of a nosebleed. He also felt like he could taste blood in his throat and mouth. The nosebleed stopped, but there was still some pressure in his sinuses. He asked if he needed to go to the hospital. He has a headache and it seemed like a sinus headache. It was more on the right side where he had the nosebleed. He could still kind of taste a little bit of blood in his mouth and throat. There were no relevant tests, but he was trying to figure out if it&#39;s needed. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. He was not hospitalized but he was trying to decide if he needed to go to the hospital. The outcome of the event nose bleed was recovered on 23Apr2021 and not recovered for all other events.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.  Follow-up (23Apr2021): New information from a contactable consumer (patient) includes: patient details, medical history, historical vaccine, therapy details, reaction data (&#34;Can taste blood in his throat and mouth&#34; and &#34;has a headache and it seems like a sinus headache&#34; were added; outcome and onset were updated), and course of events.

                                                Patient had what was suspected as a syncopal episode after receiving their vaccine. The patient syncopized in our observation area at 0835 after receiving the vaccine at 0830. The patient was witnessed sliding off their chair and onto the floor while they were reading the fact sheet on pfizer. It was suspected that the patient had anxiety while reading and had a vaso-vagal reaction, causing the subsequent syncopal episode. Patient vital signs post-syncope: BP 130/75, heart rate 73, 97% on room air. Patient was alert and oriented x4.  The patient was sat on a couch and had what was initially presented as another syncopal episode at 0847. Upon assessing the patient, I suspected that the patient had an atonic generalized seizure. The patient had slight decorticate posturing, with both arms abnormally suppinated towards his midline. The patient was slow to arouse. A 3 lead EKG was attached to the patient, with lead II showing normal sinus rhythm, no ectopy. Emergency medical services was called and arrived on-scene at 0904. The patient was assessed by Paramedics and decided to AMA with them. The patient stated that they will see their doctor.  The patient was advised to not operate any motor vehicles before being evaluated by their doctor.

A 23-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 at 1 pm (around 12:20ish as reported) (Lot Number: FN6206) (at 23-year-old) at single dose in arm right for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history relevant to AEs. The patient stated he is a pretty healthy guy. All day after getting the vaccine he was fine. He got the shot at like 1 came home took a nap, ate some dinner, and was playing XBOX with the boys when this happened. At around 10:30 pm on 29Apr2021 he went to rub, his stomach just above his belly button and it hurt. He said that he read on line that that area is called the pancreas or liver, it has a lot of names for that area when looking online. He stated it&#39;s the left upper abdomen area he felt pain when he pressed on it. It radiated really fast across his abdomen while he was on the phone with mother. The more he pressed the more the pain got sharper, and it radiated right across the abdomen, mainly above belly button not too much in lower abdomen, not much in upper abdomen. It was very sensitive. He didn&#39;t have to press hard to trigger the pain. It was almost like the area was inflamed. It happened really fast and that it was his upper stomach not so much the lower part of his abdomen. He felt dizziness and nauseous and like a silly boy he tried to run to the bathroom. He stated that he fell and fainted. His butt was still a little sore from falling. He said when he woke up, he was sweating like he had been out side all day. He did not recall sweating any time he fainted in the past. The side effects were gone after about ten minutes. He was really light headed and had the crazy sharp pain in abdomen for about ten minutes and then it was gone. He had never had that kind of pain. He was laying on the floor for a couple minutes. He went to get his phone, and then sat back down and was sweating. He still had pain at that time but it only lasted about 10 minutes at most. He was still a little bit sore in some joints which was not unexpected. He confirmed that he had a little bit of sweating, and he fainted a little bit.

The episode was witnessed and no seizure activity or signs of anaphylaxis were present. Patient appeared to have a short syncopal episode. The patient was placed on the floor with his legs up by me, and the patient states he felt much improved in that position.

After a couple, I felt super winded, like I was gonna pass out. This was concerning since I run at least 30 miles a week.   Early the next morning, I woke up with my heart racing and shortness of breath. This persisted for a couple of hours. I woke up with a stiff chest, pain and aches around my body, and struggling to breathe. I went to urgent care and they did an EKG on me that came out abnormal. They referred me to a cardiologist where I got an appointment the next day.   The cardiologist runs another ekg this time it?s worse. She sends me straight to the ER. They run a bunch of tests but nothing is conclusive. I?m released the next evening.   The following Monday I had a checkup with my cardiologist and she referred me to someone she knows at a HCF. My appointment is not until the end of June

                                                About 2 days after I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I started experiencing chest pain and muscle cramps. On day 6 I experienced it the worst, my chest tensed up and all at once my left side of my body started cramping. Most noticeable of the pain was coming from my heart. It got better as the day ended. Noticed serious muscle cramps for the week after.

                                                Two days after receiving my first vaccine dose, I began to feel a tight, uncomfortable sensation in my chest. Over a few days it grew into pain that would become worse with physical activity or when lying down. I had pericarditis last year and recognized the symptoms but I chose to go to the hospital anyways to be safe. The doctors at the ER did not have a concrete answer for me but the cautiously assumed pericarditis.

                                                Patient was administed the pfizer covid-19 vaccine 1:24pm. After the vaccine was administered patient went to a designated chair to wait for 15 minutes post-vaccine. Pharmacist monitored patient, noticed patient sitting talking on the phone shortly after vaccine. However, after a couple minutes patient passed out and fell off of chair. After yelling patient&#39;s name he came to and did not lose consciousness again. Patient suffered injury on head with a substantial laceration on forehead above eye. Code white was called and patient was given an ice pack and advised to sit for 30 minutes following incident. Asked patient if he would like us to call 911, he refused. He sat with management while an incident report was filled out and while he didn&#39;t want us to call an ambulance it did seem as though his mom was going to take him to urgent care to have his cut examined.

                                                Patient developed chest pain symptoms on the evening of 5/13, he said symptoms waxed and waned but worsened on 5/16 which prompted him to go the Hospital ER.  There he was found to have an elevated troponin 27.9 and ST elevations on ECG.  This prompted an emergent evaluation by cardiology and patient underwent a Left Heart Catherization  (LHC) on 5/16 which showed no obstructive disease.  Cardiology suspected possible myocarditis which was confirmed on 5/18 with a cardiac MRI.  Patient also had an echocardiogram that showed mildly reduced systolic function EF 50-55% and mild hypokinesis in the left ventricle (echo obtained on 5/17).  Patient was discharged on two new medications: Losartan and metoprolol and has cardiology follow up on June 1.

But from that day until now I still get a weird feeling in my left chest. I feel like my heart is twitching sometimes. Sometimes I felt that my heart was pounding. Sometimes it feels like it&#39;s going to hurt my heart. It happened continuously about 5-6 times a day. Sometimes I was paranoid about it.

                                                I am healthy 23 year old male. I have never suffered from any sort of illness or conditions. After massive push by the goverment and incentivization to take the New Covid-19 Vaccines deemed safe , I went ahead and received the Pfizer shot on 05/24/2021. A day after I felt headache and dizziness. This stopped on the third day. Later I would have episodes of blurred vision. That stopped. But what has really affected me and continues to affect me , is that a week after I have developed major difficulty breathing.  I never , ever not even once in my life have suffered from breathing problems. It all started on an afternoon a week after the shot randomly with really fast heart palpitations and after those palpitations stopped I was choking, I could not breathe at all. After this , I am having trouble breathing normally or getting enough air in along with tightness in the chest area. For instance, I struggle with two breaths and then the third I will likely get more air in. I have felt incredible tightness in my chest. There has been nights where I cannot sleep because I am unable to breathe , and feel like I am choking. So , I need to get up and walk around the house to catch my breath.  I am having shortness of breath  and my breathing is not like it used to be. I do not have any fever or any other symptoms , the persisting problem is the tightness and difficulty breathing. I already went to the Pulmonary doctor a couple days ago and underwent testing that are pending.  I do not understand why this happened to me , I am not sure if it is a coincidence or if there is a relation between  me having taken that Pfizer shot . But prior to taking that vaccine I never  once had trouble with  my breathing  and never felt tightness around my chest. This is new to me and it scares me to think this might stay with me forever, whatever it is. I pray it goes away. I am still having trouble . and the fact that in the past I never thought about my breathing because it was normal, and now it is a constant issue throughout  the day,  moments when I can get air and others when it is very difficult. I  am reporting this  to leave a record of this incident because prior to me taking this vaccine , I was in fact a fully healthy person free of any sort of health issues.

Highest temp 102, took tylenol every 4 hours to help with fever and aches. At 9:30 pm began with continuous strong chest pain/shortness of breath. Nothing made it feel better. 9:45 PM Called after hour line of primary physician, who recommended going to ER. Left for ER at 10 PM. Chest pain had eased somewhat on the way to ER. Was seen at ER. Received EKG, lab work, CT scan, IV fluids and toradol. Chest pain was mild in ER and felt better by discharge around 3:30 AM.  Felt normal by 4/19/21 and returned to work. Have seen a few reports in news about myocarditis/pericarditis in males which seem to fit patients experience, so wanted to report the incident.

Approximately 5 minutes after exiting the immunization room the patient approached the consultation window and stated he felt as if he were going to pass out. The pharmacist asked the patient to stay where he was and attempted to run around to the waiting area to help him sit. Before the pharmacist could make it to the patient he collapsed. The patient was in a seated position slumped against the wall, very pale, and profusely sweating. Pharmacist helped him to sit up straight and the patient started responding to questions. Other team members alerted EMS and got a water bottle for the patient. We moved him up to a chair and to the immunization area when he was able and waited for EMS to arrive. Patient was treated by EMS and left the building with them under his own power.

I(pharmacist) ran to his side, I though he was having a seizure ,yelled to my technician to call 911 , but with further assesment I knew he didnt have a seizure, he fell on his face and his arms tucked under his abdomen, so he couldn&#39;t lift himself up properly. I sat him up,he was responsive to my questions, pulse was very faint and he started to sweat,pale,clammy . His nose was bleeding from the fall. Within 9 minutes paramedic showed up , took blood pressure and glucose check. After assesment they didn&#39;t feel it was necessary to go to emergency room. Patient didn&#39;t eat breakfast,got him apple juice and chocolate. This never happened to him before. His friend came to meet him and make sure he was ok, he left voluntarily ,and back to himself.

He sits down in the waiting area to be monitored. We heard his phone dropped, looked up and saw him tilting over on the right side was about to fall off the chair. Staff grabbed him and held him back onto the seat, proceeded to picked up his right arm and held him in place. He looked unconscious while staff held him. He came back to his senses approximately 10 seconds later. After he regained consciousness, staff took his blood pressure which was 111/44, SpO2 was 100%, and heart rate 58. Patient looked pale but not critical. Conversed with our staff and stated that this has happened before when he receives other vaccinations. Patient&#39;s father is a physician and reported that the patient is scared of needles and did not need any medications from anaphylaxis kit or crash cart. We gave him water and he left after sitting for a while.

                                                On Friday morning 2/26/21, we had a 24 yo male patient who had an anaphylactic reaction after his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He was instructed to wait on the chair, but had stood up at some point but was still in the pharmacy waiting area. A team member noticed he had fainted and called for help. The pharmacist on duty and immunizing tech came immediately to help him to a chair. At that point, he was conscious and talking. Then within a few seconds he started convulsing on the chair and lost consciousness. His eyes were open and head tilted back. A team member immediately called 911 and pharmacist administered 0.3mg Epipen to the thigh. We removed his face mask to check his breathing and also to allow him to breathe more easily. We also adjusted his head more forward and he started coughing. After about 15 seconds, he regained consciousness and could answer questions. EMT arrived soon after and took over. Patient does not have allergies or any history of anaphylaxis/ severe reaction from vaccinations. He did express some fear of needles and did not eat breakfast yet.

I was then moved to the observation area where my chest got tight, I had difficulty breathing and my temperature fluctuated which made me shake. When hives began to show on my face, neck and ears the on-site medical staff gave me a shot of epinephrine and Benadryl and put me on oxygen, during this time an ambulance was called by the staff. When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

                                                Nausea and Headaches occurred about 5 hours after the injection, since then they have come and gone periodically, usually lasting about 30 minutes, then going away for a few hours. I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

                                                got up about 5:15AM to use the restroom, parents heard a huge crash and we came running - he had collapsed and fainted in the bathroom, against the toilet, (with shelves and glass crashing down him - he grabbed the shelves and had a few cuts and bruises), was unresponsive, no color in his face, could not stand or move, could barely speak - slumped against the toilet.  Parents called 911 and tried to get him to respond, he was listless but opened his eyes - we lifted him and moved him to recliner in living room.  Fire Dept./EMT&#39;s arrived within a few minutes, blood pressure was 87/43, glucose was normal.  EMT&#39;s determined it was a reaction to the vaccine and asked if he wanted an ambulance or if parents should drive him for further care - he opted for us to drive him (his Mom called the Dr. on staff first - Dr. said it was a reaction to the vaccine and he should not get a 2nd dose).  Patient&#39;s Dad took him to Urgent Care - they ran an EKG (normal), and stayed there until his blood pressure showed (although still low)  normal/acceptable again.  I looked at the CDC website for covid anaphylaxis and it appears it was an allergic reaction (cardiovascular), on the site, he had these symptoms:  &#34;Cardiovascular: fainting; hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure); pallor.  ... Symptoms of anaphylaxis often occur within 15-30 minutes of vaccination, though it can sometimes take several hours for symptoms to appear.&#34;

                                                This 24 yo male reports receipt of his first Pfizer Covid vaccine lot #EN6199 to his Left deltoid.  He advised within &lt;15 minutes following the vaccine he sensed the left side of his neck was swelling.  He notified Immunization staff who brought him to the ER via w/c. He stated the ERMD did not perceive/palpate any swelling or nodules, and treated him with IV Benadryl with resolution of s/s.  He did not require any other doses of benadryl.    He received his 2nd Pfizer covid vaccine on 3/30/2021 lot#ER8734 to right deltoid.  He stated within 15 min again, he had the sensation of throat stiffness (as if muscles really tight/tensed) and this made it difficult to breath and caused his chest to hurt. He was taken to the ER again and given Benadryl again with resolution of symptoms. He was released later without any reoccurrence of symptoms. He states he went to work on 3/31 where he began to feel bad/achy-feverish.  Today he had a fever (not taken), total body aches but mostly to his left hand.  He reports feeling fatigue and unable to do normal AM routine of working out.  He could only stretch today.  He denies any trauma, recent illness, difficulty breathing, swallowing, eating, ha, n/v/d, or other symptoms.

                                                DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 1. Chest x-ray that was normal. 2. CT angiography of the chest showing no abnormalities. 3. Echocardiogram showing no significant abnormalities.  HOSPITAL COURSE: A 24-year-old male, primary care patient, received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination 3 days prior to admission.  Following this, he had a fever, chills, body aches, and then developed severe chest pain.  The pain was worse lying flat, better when sitting up and leaning forward and worse with a deep breath.  He had gone to an urgent Care and was recommended going to the emergency room.  The patient&#39;s troponins were elevated and his EKG was fairly classic for pericarditis.  He was felt to have probably viral myopericarditis and was admitted for observation.  He was placed on aspirin and colchicine.  He seems stable from Cardiology to be discharged on this regimen as well as symptomatic treatment.  It was not known whether the COVID vaccine was implicated with this or not.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: CONDITION:  Stable and improved.  MEDICATIONS: 1. Colchicine 0.6 mg b.i.d. 2. Aspirin 650 mg t.i.d. 3. Oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg every 4 hours p.r.n. for pain. 4. Zofran 4 mg sublingual q.8 hours p.r.n. for nausea.  DIET: Regular.  ACTIVITY: As tolerated.  FOLLOWUP: With Cardiology on May 3rd.  If worsened pain, shortness of breath, or high fever, return for evaluation sooner.  In which case, steroids may be administered.

                                                fell out completely; passed out/fell off at the store; feeling dizzy; had terrible headache; chills; weak with shilling; i started sweating; I&#39;m still feeling very sick; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 24-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158; Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eye allergy. Concomitant medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AMOXICILINA CLAV) taken for eye allergy from 12Apr2021. On 14Apr2021, he received the first dose of the vaccine about an hour ago and waited five minutes and went to the bathroom. He had a severe reaction while patient was in the bathroom, he started to feel dizzy, had a terrible headache and chills. He walked out of the bathroom at the store and fell out completely in front of the pharmacists. The patient also experienced weak with shilling (as reported) and started sweating. The pharmacists called 911 and the responders checked his vitals and blood pressure and all of that and everything was fine. Patient clarified he passed out completely for almost 5 minutes. Patient stayed there with everyone until, they were waiting to see how he was doing. He reported he was feeling much better now, still feel a bit dizzy, not 100% but not as bad as when it happened. It has improved and he definitely felt terrible at the time. He was monitoring himself at home to see if he notices something weird going on. He does not have a headache right now and was feeling much better. When he was having the effect, he was mentally sharp, and knew what was going on. He thought about letting himself walk outside the bathroom so he could be seen. He didn&#39;t lose track of what was going on and body reacted adversely. He remembered stuff and everything and he felt good. Patient stated the chills went away; however, would not say they went away completely, he was recovering. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office and the paramedic said it was not necessary right now because all the vitals and everything else seemed fine. There was no therapy received for the events. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the vaccine and no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of events feeling dizzy, terrible headache, chills was recovering; still feeling very sick was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

                                                After receiving the Pfizer vaccine the patient had a small drop of blood. I grabbed a cotton swab and asked the patient to hold still. He said that he did not handle blood well. About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient stated that he was feeling like he needed to lay down. I laid him down in the booth area and obtained a BP 102/48, HR 43 normal cuff, supine position, left arm. Technician and I then elevated the patient&#39;s feet on a chair as the patient was appearing pale. Technician and I placed a ice pack on the back of the patient&#39;s neck as he was feeling hot/clammy. After about 15 minutes the patient was feeling much better and his blood pressure returned to normal - 108/55 HR 53, normal cuff, supine position, left arm. Patient stated that he was a avid cardio exerciser. The patient was then instructed to wait another 10 minutes and then he checked in before leaving and said he was feeling great.

Patient received first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine and sat in chairs to be observed. About 15 minutes later I walked out to check on the patient and he was staring straightforward, sweating, and pale. When asked if he was okay he stated his vision was looking blurry and felt dizzy. Took patient&#39;s blood pressure, elevated his legs as I couldn&#39;t move him safely at the time, gave him water to drink, applied cool compresses to neck and forehead. Patient was observed by a clinic staff member during entire event. Rechecked patient&#39;s blood pressure 5 minutes later at resolution of symptoms. Patient then left with adult visitor that came with him.

We came out to assist and at that point the patient was already sitting up, but on the floor.  We were able to speak to him and gave him some water to drink.  We called 911, when we were aware he had fainted.  I was the pharmacist on duty, but not the one that vaccinated him.  So I stayed with him.  There was a moment when he took his sweater off saying he was hot, and I saw sweat bullets on his forehead.  So I got some paper towels for him and took his temperature, which read around 98 degrees.  A few seconds later he turned pale and fell over, hitting his head on one of the shelves.  I quickly got him off the shelf and held his head in my arms .  He opened his eyes and started talking and wanting to sit up, but we kept him laying down and continued to ask him questions to keep him alert.  He was able to answer the questions, knew where he was, who he was, who he was with .  The paramedics then arrived and he was taken out of the store on a stretcher.  We provided a copy of the report he filled out to the paramedics .

                                                24-year-old male with no prior medical problems presents for evaluation of chest pain.  Patient complains of midsternal chest pain that started approximately an hour ago.  He states that it woke him up from sleep.  Pain is sharp without any radiation or other associated symptoms including diaphoresis presyncopal symptoms or palpitations.  He denies any significant air hunger or shortness of breath.  He otherwise had been feeling better after what he tall was post COVID vaccine symptoms.  Patient received a 2nd dose of pfizer vaccine 3 days ago.  He states that within 24 hours he had symptoms of myalgia fever and feeling unwell.  That has been resolving patient has been feeling better until the chest pain today. Patient otherwise denies any other medical problems in.  He denies any history of drug use including any recent cocaine or other drug abuse.   Elevated cardiac enzymes and chest discomfort are likely secondary to myocarditis and secondary to vaccination/ inflammatory reaction.  Although there is low likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease as well.  I recommended cardiac catheterization for clarification.  He does not want to have the procedure done, understands the risk of undiagnosed coronary artery disease and risk of MI.  He would like to be discharged home.    I reviewed the images of echocardiogram and it seems that he has a small area of hypokinesis in infero basal segment.   Recommended to take aspirin and be seen in Cardiology office in 2 weeks.  Advised to abstain from exercise and significant physical activity till that time and return to the hospital if any symptoms.       Subjective:   I saw patient in consultation for evaluation of chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes.   Patient is a 24-year-old healthy male who had COVID-19 vaccination with his second Pfizer shot 4/14/21. He developed fever, chills, nausea and vomiting 1 day after vaccination.  He did not have any reaction to the 1st dose.   He presented to the hospital with substernal chest discomfort which woke him up from sleep, radiated to throat and had a throbbing feeling.  This lasted for 1 to 2 hours and subsided completely in the hospital.   He smokes 5 cigarettes a day, is physically very active and exercises regularly.  He is not on any medication at home.

                                                2 weeks after my second pfizer dose I experienced intense chest pains for ~4 straight days. The pain was located in my upper-left chest / peck area. With each inhalation I experienced significant pain (a 5 out of 10, at least). This lasted for several days and slowly went away. However, about 2 weeks later and again 3 weeks later I felt this pain again. I&#39;ve never had chest pain before. I am young, healthy, don&#39;t consume alcohol regularly, do not smoke, and I exercise often. I brushed off the chest pain as &#34;the human body is weird and does weird things&#34;. However, now seeing that myocarditis may be an apparent side-effect, I want to report this strange occurrence.

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  I experienced extreme chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath, painful heart beats, I could feel each beat. I hunched over in my bed groom grabbing my abdomen and fell onto my bed and almost passed out from whack I?d assume is lack of oxygen. I could barely breathe for about five minutes and felt relatively severe pain particularly in the right side of my chest. I could feel every muscle, tendon, and artery inflamed, enlarged, and hurting. My chest felt like it filled up with a balloon. Heart rate went up too. I have NEVER EVER felt ANYTHING like this in my LIFE. Not even close. It was a brand new sensation to me first time I?ve ever felt anything like this at all, and very intense and frustrating. Keeping in mind I am in perfect health. I am a body builder with a perfect physique. I work at a high end restaurant and have an extremely good diet. I have a normal sleep and sexual routine, I don?t use any medications whatsoever even Tylenol or ibuprofen. I have no pre existing conditions. I have no history of heart or cardio problems. My family has a history of low blood pressure. I have next to no stress or anxiety in my life. I am 24 years old I work out and run miles, five to six days a week. I don?t use nicotine, tobacco, and I haven?t had a drink of alcohol in ten years (14yrs old). I smoke marijuana on a daily basis. After about ten minutes the incident went down and I was able to breathe a little better but still had pain and tightness in my chest. I have had shortness of breath ever since. This is being written the day after the event about 26 hours later. I ran a mile last night and went to the gym it seemed to help both my breathing and the pain and tightness but it has not fully gone away. I feel my heart straining somehow as I am typing this. One thing to note is I did not want to get vaccinated but was pressured to do so, and before getting it I was very nervous and honestly upset. The woman administering it was not helpful at all and actually mocked my unsureness and was very rude and unprofessional. She didn?t answer any technical questions I had. During my interaction with her between my nerves and her behavior I?m absolutely certain my heart rate was elevated at the time of getting the shot. I have only had one shot. The episode of  myocarditis occurred two weeks after my first shot. Two days after my scheduled second shot, which I missed because of work and was going to reschedule before this occurred. I am not going to be getting the second shot. Will be following up with my primary care doctor as soon as possible. Haven?t had time.

EMS was called, patient denied care. HIS BP WAS 104/73 AT 12:53 PM AND HIS hr WAS 72 BPM. I did notice some mild seizure like physical symptoms  as he woke up - arms and shoulders jerked a little for a few seconds. he said that the same, but worse, reaction happened after his first dose.

                                                Since my second shot of the vaccine, I have been experiencing chest pain. My chest feels tight and hurts a little bit. Any psychical  exertion causes the tightness and pain to increase a lot, like i&#39;m being stabbed by a knife.  If I go on a walk, it gets really bad and I start to feel it in my throat and back. It subsides if I lay down or sit still for a while. It seems to be caused by movement and exertion. Also, my left toe is now partially numb. It is not fully numb, but feels like pins and needles when I touch it. This has been happening since I got the second shot I think.

                                                Days following dose 2, I began having fluid retention and elevated blood pressure.  Over time, it has worsened.  I am now having dizzy spells that can last 10 minutes to 6 hours up to twice a day, confusion/brain fog and heart flutters/elevated heart rate usually accompanied with fatigue.  My previous doctor treated me by increasing the metoprolol and adding hydrochlorothiazide for fluid retention.  I saw a new healthcare provider who is sending me to a cardiologist, neurologist, lipidologist and endocrinologist to figure out what is going  on.  I can not function in daily life. I cannot stand when dizzy and cannot drive.  Symptoms appear to be worsening.  In the meantime, he prescribed Ubrelvy to rule out migraines.  None of this appeared until after dose 2 of Pfizer.

On April 2nd, I was laying on the couch watching a movie and I had petechaie on my back from the couch. I also had it in a few spots on my chest. I did not have any bleeding. During my work shifts, I was fatigued during most of them that month. I saw my primary care doctor on April 29th and got labs drawn. The next day he called saying that my platelets were 5,000 and I did not have petechaie or bleeding at that time. Treatment has been 4 consecutive days of 40 mg of dexamethasone. My platelets dropped back to a similar level, so I was placed on prednisone 60 mg with a taper once I started 4 weekly Rituxamab treatments. I just finished those and my hematologist is recommending a spleenectomy at this time.

However, those symptoms subsided by Sunday, April 4th, 2021. Instead, I began to have very odd chest pains that I have never had before. I went to the ER and they believed it was due to me taking too much ibuprofen for my fever symptoms which would give me heart burn and said it could be a symptom from the vaccine. The night thereafter I woke up due to an earthquake and felt the chest pain only much worse. I immediately went to the ER again.

                                                patient passed out approximately 9 minutes after receiving his 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine.  he left his 15 minute observation period and became light headed as he passed out while on his walk to the bathroom in the facility he received his vaccine in.  he did not hit his head or otherwise injure himself during the fall. patient stated that he has a history of passing out after receiving dental work novocaine injections but did not tell this to the vaccine administrator when prompted to detail his &#34;unsure&#34; response to the question, &#34;have you ever had an allergic reaction or fainted after receiving a vaccine or an injectable medication&#34; on the vaccine consent questionnaire.  This information was provided to me by the patient after he passed out and we were asking him questions.  He felt fine and was taken back to the pharmacy for an additional 20 minutes of observation and provided him with a bottle of water.  he felt fine and left without incident after this observation period.

                                                Patient found to have large pericardial effusion without tamponade. He is now status post sub-xiphoid pericardial window with subsequent drainage of effusions. Pericardial pathology showed hemorrhagic pericardial tissue with marked acute and chronic inflammation and adherent fibrin consistent with fibrinous pericarditis. Patient endorses improved symptoms post-operatively, remains afebrile, and is without leukocytosis. Minimal residual pain is likely secondary to his recently removed chest tube. Medical team plans to discharge patient today.

                                                Chest pain issues have resolved mostly. The most debilitating thing to come after the vaccine was the onset of ringing, buzzing persistently in left ear, comes and goes in right ear. Started 2 weeks and 2 days after second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and after flying multiple times and started when I got back on the 13th of April 2021. It has remained constant but has improved slightly from where it was in the beginning, have been doing Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (five 1 hour sessions, spaced about a week-week and a half apart over the last 2 months to see if things improve). Things I would say have improved but I am running out of patience and financial means to keep going to a doctor. I feel helpless, depressional, work performance is awful, and lastly very suicidal than I have ever been. Just want to die.

                                                I believe these symptoms are consistent with the reports of myocarditis; Headache; Shortness of breath; Chest tightness all sustained between 12-24 hours after receiving 2nd dose; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer, the patient. A 24-years-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EWO198), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Jul2021 at 20:15 (at the age of 24-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine was Pharmacy or Drug Store. Medical history included known allergies to Penicillin from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, covid-19 from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (If covid prior vaccination: Yes). There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 14Jun2021 at 20:15 (at the age of 24-years-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EWO181) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and did not experience any adverse reaction. No other vaccine administered in four weeks. Adverse event description stated by patient as on 06Jul2021 at 08:00 was headache, shortness of breath, and chest tightness all sustained between 12-24 hours after receiving 2nd dose. Took 2 Tylenol 24hrs after 2nd dose, symptoms dissipated, reappeared next morning, albeit reduced severity. I believe these symptoms are consistent with the reports of myocarditis (though the symptoms are admittedly nondescript) experienced by others in my demographic group following the 2nd dose. Patient was tested covid post vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab test on 07Jul2021 with unknown result. The patient received treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

The patient medical history was none. Patient states he had no prior medical history or cardiovascular issues. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. The patient experienced cardiomyopathy on May2021, diagnosed with heart failure on an unspecified date, there&#39;s inflammation within his heart as well as reduced ejection fraction on an unspecified date, chest pain on 02May2021, palpitations on 02May2021, rapid heart beat on 02May2021, there&#39;s inflammation within his heart as well as reduced ejection fraction on an unspecified date. Patient went to a specialist that Monday, a private practice, and after a good range of medical tests, he was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and was admitted. The patient was hospitalized for cardiomyopathy and heart failure from 04May2021 to 06May2021. Patient states he was hospitalized 5 days later and diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and he was diagnosed with heart failure after he received the Pfizer vaccine after a good range of tests and MRI&#39;s, it seems there&#39;s inflammation within his heart as well as a reduced ejection fraction. Patient states it happened immediately after being vaccinated and since then have been taking cardiovascular medications everyday. Patient states he had a regular MRI heart with and without contrast in May2021. Patient states they said there was decent range of dysfunction. Patient states it&#39;s super detailed, so he thinks he would rather Pfizer get in touch with the doctor. Patient states the report is 2 pages long, but what he knows for certain is it was cardiomyopathy for sure. Patient states he also got a PET MRI heart in Jun2021 as well. Patient states his doctors said it can&#39;t be confirmed 100% but they have a reason to believe it could have been from the vaccine. Patient states he needs an answer from Pfizer and he&#39;s not the first person that&#39;s probably called in, he needs someone to hear him on this. Patient states he doesn&#39;t want to contact the media. Patient states he needs an answer, this has ruined his life essentially. Patient states he knows it&#39;s not specifically the call handler or Pfizer, but this is taking a lot for him and if someone can get back to him on this that would be great. Patient states he is a 24 year old, able-bodied guy, who&#39;s very healthy and it all started right after getting vaccinated. The outcome of cardiomyopathy, chest pain, palpitations, rapid heart beat was recovering, of the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected

When I got out to the waiting room, patient was pale, but conscious and responding to me. Tech called paramedics. I had him lay on the ground until he felt ok to sit up. My technician got him some water to drink. He said this has happened once before on an ear piercing. Paramedics showed up within 5 minutes. I recounted what happened to one of the paramedics while the other took the patient&#39;s vitals. Paramedics took him out to their truck for further evaluation.

A 24-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 28Jun2021 (Lot Number: EW0164) at 24 years old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included unspecified vitamin type. The patient had experienced chest pain on Jun2021. When the chest pain started, he had kind of a very sort of dull and not severe pain. It started within a day or two of the vaccine dose. He had that for a little bit, then it went away, then it came back a couple days ago. He started yesterday, which has happened only twice, to have a sharp pain that ripples across the left side of his chest that lasts for 5-10 seconds and was painful enough for him to stop what he was doing, and it came without warning then went away on its own. He had been running out of breath pretty easily, and was pretty fatigued. He went to urgent care today, and they didn&#39;t know what wrong with him, and if it got worse, to go to the emergency room. When he first got the pain in the middle of his chest he went to the chiropractor because he thought he might have a rib out, which indeed it did go away for a while. He didn&#39;t know if it could have anything to do with his left side though, the middle of chest, because it seems like two completely different things. He did take Naproxen sodium and the pain went down a bit, he took one last night and the pain went away for a bit. He says that this is an off brand of what might be known as Naprosyn. The dose is 220mg (EXP: Aug2022). He took one liquid gel type capsule by mouth, and his pain was reduced. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 molecular test: negative on 16Jul2021. The outcome was unknown.

                                                Severe apneic episodes with sleep. I have no history of sleep apnea, BMI of 24, exercise regularly, no known snoring. The night after my first dose at around 23:00 while falling asleep I shortly after having been asleep would wake up gasping for air.  Attempting to fall back asleep I felt the need to consciously make myself breathe, and when I would fall asleep no more than 5-10 after I would wake up gasping for air. This continued on until around close to 03:00 on 1/7/21. When I finally fell asleep around 03:00 woke up gasping for air around 04:45 and never fell back asleep. The next two nights, 1/7/21 and 1/8/21 I would have trouble falling asleep because these same apneic episodes were happening until around 03:00. The night of 1/9/21 I had no issues sleeping, and have had no apnea since those three nights.  These apneic episodes were followed by extreme anxiety from being unable to sleep fully (I worried moreso about not falling asleep than the apnea). Heart rate when counted ranged for 70s-80s and my normal HR while sleeping is around low 50s.

                                                I had chest pains that felt like tightness of my chest.  Friends and family said it sounded like a heart attack (despite being only 25 years old).  It hurt to sit up or maneuver my chest/rib cage in any manner, for example, a sit up caused extreme pain.  The pain was consistent throughout the day.  After it began to dissipate, it was only reproducible when my chest/rib cage was moved or had pressure put onto it. Went to the doctor, diagnosed me with costochondritis.  Received an anti-inflammatory shot.  Reduced the pain.  From initial pain to full recovery was about 3 days (if memory serves correctly, VSafe should have the correct dates as I responded accurately there).  A slight discomfort in my chest did occur after my second shot, but nowhere near the same amount of discomfort.

At the time of patients fainting I was mixing up covid-19 vaccinations when the technicians said we need you to come out here because a patient is having a seizure, When arriving on the scene I found patient unconsious on the floor face down, while assessing the scene I noticed some blood on floor. I tried to look for any trauma, patient was breathing and I tried to awaken him. I told someone to call 911 and contact a store manager. Then all of a sudden he popped up and sat up like nothing happened. I then noticed the brusing on his nose and asked for an ice pack and a bottle of water. Patient knew his name, was coherent, and seemed to be fine. I stayed with patient until paramedics arrived. Paramedics did a thorough examination and everything checked out. Patient waited for parents to arrive instead of going with paramedics. Vaccinator stayed with patient till his parents arrived.

                                                Patient reported to clinic for Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination.  Patient did not indicate on questionnaire that he had experienced fainting or severe reactions from receiving vaccinations before. About 5 seconds after receiving vaccination patient said he would like to sit for just a minute.  The clinic had a designated waiting area about 25 feet away where patients sit for 15 minutes after receiving vaccination.  My technician and I agreed that patient should stay seated in the same chair he was receiving the vaccination in so we would be right next to him.  After 2-3 minutes I noticed the patient had his eyes closed and then his head began to nod and he started to slump down in the chair.  As I went to patient&#39;s side to stabilize him he pushed his chair backwards away from me about 5 feet which caused him to roll to the right side of the chair and fall off hitting his head on the floor. My technician immediately called 911 and EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes.  A bystander who was a nurse helped me roll him onto his back and we propped his legs up with 2 cushions.  We took his blood pressure and pulse. Patient regained consciousness in about 30 seconds and the EMTs cleared him to stand up after about 15 minutes.  After patient had recovered, patient&#39;s mother who was there with patient and other siblings stated that the whole family has fainting episodes when receiving vaccinations. I informed patient&#39;s mother and patient to please inform any future vaccinators of these fainting episodes so they can be prepared.

                                                Shortly after receiving first vaccine, patient was waiting in line to schedule second dose.  During this time, became syncopal and fell.  Transported to urgent care for monitoring, and discharged in stable condition.  Provider conclusion is that patient experienced a vasovagal event secondary to injection.  Vaccine itself does not appear to have any correlation to the event, but given that patient was transferred to a higher level of care, will submit a VAERS report.

                                                We had a patient today that passed out after his covid vaccine.  It was his 2nd covid immunization.  He got his immunization at the pharmacy in the booth and then he sat down in one of the waiting chairs at the end of the cough and cold aisle.  While he was sitting down, he began to feel unwell, he then got up off his chair and then was approaching the drop off window (he was going to let us know he didn&#39;t feel well) at that time he then passed out.  He fell into the privacy screen of the imz booth.  He did fall into the booth which did break some of his fall.  He also knocked off one of the frames that we had on the wall, and then I think it fell on his nose.  He did get a cut nose and he also bit his lip or mouth because his mouth was bleeding also.  He reported that his nose did hurt, and he will have a prominent bruise on his nose.   We did provide him with a couple of ice packs and a bottle of water.   The patient (25 years old) and his mother both stated that he has passed out in the past when he has been around needles.  He stated that he got to thinking about getting the shot and the needle going into his arm and that is when he started to feel unwell.

                                                On Wednesday April 14th I got my second vaccination shot. The following day I had a 103 F fever, body aches, chills, migraine, sore muscles, couldn&#39;t walk, excessive thirst. Those effects lasted all day and I felt better on Friday. Saturday night chest pain started along with sore arm getting worse. I took ibuprofen and melatonin to sleep. Woke up Sunday morning and pain came back and gradually got worse until I went into the ER around 9 am. They gave me Morphine to put the chest pain at bay. Then transferred me by ambulance to a different hospital with a cariology department. They treated me as if it was Myocarditis and also got an x-ray of my chest. The next morning I had an MRI and that is what confirmed it to be Myocarditis. I was then discharged with lots of medications to keep the inflammation down.

They left the pharmacy area and went to get Tylenol that was recommended by the pharmacist. They then began to get lightheaded and had syncope, attempted to get back up and the cashier asked to if they wanted to sit, but fell again. It was not clear initially to the employee who was helping them they had received the vaccine. 911 was called and the employee helping them let the pharmacist know they had just gotten their vaccine. The immunizing pharmacist went to check on the patient. EMTs were already helping the patient and had taken his blood pressure which was normal the lightheadedness had stopped and both sitting and standing blood pressure was the same. He had an elevated heart rate per the patient but didn&#39;t know any of the numbers the EMTs had taken. His father was driving him. He was not experiencing any symptoms and the injection site had no swelling and was otherwise unremarkable.

He reports that he doesn&#39;t do well with vaccinations. He believes that he started feeling this way before the vaccine was even completely administered. He looked pale. We had him sit on the ground and he ended up drinking water and resting for well over 30 minutes so we could observe him. At no point did he have trouble breathing or swallowing. We had him stand up for several minutes to make sure not dizzy before he left. He refused a ride home, ambulance and said did not need to get ride home. Said he felt completely back to normal before leaving.

                                                25yo male patient fainted about 5min after receiving the vaccine while sitting in an observation chair. He fell to the side off his chair and hit head on the concrete floor, with his body still on the chair. Patient had convulsion-like movements. It was unclear if it was seizure-type activity or if his body was struggling to sit up from the supine position laying on the chair. Patient was attended to immediately by pharmacist  - he responded immediately to my talking to him and touching his shoulders. Patient was guided to an upright seated position, then helped to floor and asked to lie on floor with legs elevated. 911 was called and Seattle Fire Dept arrived about 5min later. Patient was fully aware of surroundings, his name, etc. Evaluated him and took multiple blood pressure readings with him laying on floor and eventually sitting up. His pressure was initially low but recovered to normal over 15-30 minutes. Ambulance was called but patient declined as his parents were on their way. Patient&#39;s blood pressure recovered to normal and he was able to sit and stand, was fully conversational throughout the episode. Patient left building of his own accord with his family to seek medical follow-up.

The pt fell to the ground mainly falling on his buttocks and then to his back.  After approx. 20-30 seconds, the pt awoke and sat up on his own.  He then stated he was feeling better and drank some water. About 3-5 minutes later, he was able to get back to his chair where he sat coherent for another 30-40 minutes.  After being assessed by paramedic/fire chief, it was recommended he go to the hospital to be further assessed.  He left walking away with paramedics.

                                                Ever since I got the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine, there&#39;s been something wrong with my heartbeat. It feels stronger, to the point where it keeps me up at night sometimes. At first it was subtle, and I thought it could have been indigestion (I have IBS which sometimes causes gastrointestinal distress), or anxiety. However, both of those conditions have been with me for many years, and this particular event began precisely when I got my first dose of the COVID19 vaccine - that night. The first time, it went away after a few days, but after my second dose, it came back (again, the same night the vaccine was administered) and hasn&#39;t gone away since. It&#39;s still subtle enough that I don&#39;t notice it during the day, but it&#39;s there quite clearly every single night now. I&#39;m getting used to it, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be causing any other health problems or adverse effects, but something has definitely changed.

                                                Beginning on the evening of Monday, May 10th, I began to feel a dull soreness in my chest, directly over the heart. I took an antacid believing it may be heartburn, but symptoms did not resolve. I scheduled a doctor&#39;s appointment for the next day as I felt something was definitely &#34;off&#34;.  The next afternoon I walked about 30 minutes to the clinic throughout relatively hilly terrain and did notice that I seemed a bit more tired than usual and felt my heart was working a bit harder, but it was hard to tell if it was just mental anxiety about the whole thing. I met with Dr. and an EKG was performed. The results indicated possible LAE and possible RV conduction delay.  Both him and a colleague didn&#39;t see much reason for concern, however. I scheduled an upcoming video visit with a cardiologist. The feeling continued, varying in intensity for the next week. On Wednesday, May 19th (2wks post 2nd dose, 9 days post symptom onset), I returned home from a motorcycle ride (something I mention as it often results in stress?still learning) and walked up to my third floor apartment. I noticed I was particularly stressed from the climb and my heart felt like it was working harder than usual, and consequently I felt the strongest pain since the initial onset. That pain lasted for a few hours until subsiding somewhat that evening, but was consistently present. The following day the pain had reduced significantly. It is now May 22nd and it&#39;s felt mostly normal all day, but is still definitely there. Feels worse when I get anxious or stressed. Heart rate as measured by my Apple Watch appears consistently normal aside from aforementioned stress or anxiety.

                                                Pt reported an anaphylactic history to bee stings with his last reaction being in 2017 during his screening. Pt was instructed to wait an additional 30 minutes following his vaccination. Pt was given his vaccine at 1134. Pt reported a sensation of &#34;tongue swelling and chest tightness&#34; at 1139. Pt reported it felt like his past anaphylactic reaction. Pt voice sounded muffled, tongue appeared swollen. Pt self administered 1 adult Epi Pen at 1139 with x1 RN and x1 medic supervision. VS were taken. HR was 107, BP was 137/92, SpO2 was 97%. Lung sounds were clear in the apices and diminished in the bases bilaterally. Periorbital swelling was noted at 1140. 911 was called and an ambulance was dispatched at this time. The pt denied a feeling of nausea, denied dizziness. Pt was alert and oriented x4/4 for the entirety of observation. VS were taken again at 1144. The HR was 97, BP was 131/85, SpO2 was 97%. Last reported oral intake of a &#34;bagel and coffee at 0800&#34;. VS taken again at 1147, HR 101, BP 135/86, SpO2 98%. Pt reported a continued feeling of throat tightness, periorbital swelling was increasing. Ambulance arrived at 1154 and was given full report. Paramedic assumed care at 1155. Paramedic team deemed it safe to administer one more dose of epinephrine and transport patient via ambulance to ER. In ER, patient endorses mild chest tightness but denies any shortness of breath, oral pharyngeal edema, difficulty swallowing, wheezing, abdominal discomfort, nausea or vomiting, pruritus, or hives.  He was given Benadryl, methylprednisolone, and famotidine while in the emergency department to finish the allergic reaction cocktail.  He was observed for a total of 3 hours after his last epi injection and he remained HDS and asymptomatic.  He was given a prescription for EpiPen autoinjectors with multiple refills.  Patient was advised that he should not receive his second covered vaccination without discussing with his PCM.  He was given strict return precautions and patient felt comfortable being discharged home.

It has been 3 weeks and I am not feeling better at all. I have a pounding heartbeat, and a pounding headache.  At this point the vaccine has been worse than the disease itself. I hope you stop misleading the public and communicate that myocarditis and severe inflammation IS 100% A SIDE EFFECT THAT IS CAUSED BY THE VACCINE RESPONSE. I know because I am experiencing it, and you&#39;ve ruined the last 24 days of my life. Thank you.

                                                Pt is a 25M with PMH of GERD, ADHD, obesity who presented to the ED on 5/11 for chest pain. That morning he had noticed increased substernal chest pressure associated with palpitations, nausea, diaphoresis, and left arm tingling. He notes that early last year he was very sick and though he had COVID but confirmatory testing was not available at that time. After recovering from the illness he noted that he had occasionally episodes of chest pressure and palpitations. However yesterday was the worst his symptoms have ever been. He did receive his 2nd COVID vaccine this past Saturday and experienced fatigue, nausea, weakness.  In the ED patient has HD stable, afebrile, saturating well on RA. Labs were notable for troponin of 5.2 which trend down to 3.1. ESR WNL, CRP elevated 2.4. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with signs suggestive of possible pericarditis. CXR negative. CTA showed no pulmonary embolism, enlarged and prominent left axillary lymph nodes, nonspecific, cholelithiasis. Patient admitted for NSTEMI. Enlarged axillary lymph nodes likely reactive in the setting of recent COVID vaccine.    Cardiology consulted. Patient underwent cardiac cath which was unremarkable. Cardiology recommends short course NSAIDs for possible pericarditis, however EKG changes unimpressive per cardiology. Discharged home on ibuprofen 400 mg TID for 5 days. Advise follow up with PCP within 1 week.

                                                Patient developed sudden onset of fevers and malaise on 5/7/21 (26 days after his 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine).  His symptoms progressed to involve shortness of breath which prompted his admission to our Hospital on 5/12/21.  He rapidly deteriorated requiring intubation and ultimately placement on ECMO and temporary internal heart pump (Impella device) placement.  He was thought to have myocarditis due to elevated troponins at the time of admission and cardiac MRI showing wide spread myocardial inflammation suggestive of myocarditis.   He was treated with high dose steroids and supportive care due to the concern for cytokine storm and eventually started to show signs of improvement.   He was eventually taken off ECMO, internal heart pump and ventilatory support and went home after 20 days in the hospital.  However, follow up cardiac MRI revealed ongoing myocarditis, but his ejection fraction had improved.

I recovered within a few days just medicating with advil and tylenol. I am reporting this incident because I have seen reports from the CDC about cases of myocondritis occuring after vaccination, and symptoms very similar to what I experienced.   https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html

Took vaccine on June 2, mild pain in chest on June 3, it got a bit better after a day or two. It came back on Sunday with more pain suddenly. Went for a walk and it felt better for the rest of the day and also the next day. On Wednesday is was bad, more painful than sunday, went to PCP. Thursday was the worst day, hurt to move, can&#39;t move in bed and wakes up from pain from moving or rotating in bed. Having chest pain since last week, sharp pain on the left front of chest. Pain worsens when leaning forward. Significant pleuritic pain. Started taking Naproxen and Cochicine and conditions have been much better. Still recovering with very mild pain in the same area now.

                                                Over a month after receiving my second dose of Pfizer, I had an episode of lightheadedness, dizziness, shakiness, and fatigue. I attributed it to dehydration and laid down and ate a snack, I began to feel better after 1-2 hours. A week later I had another lightheadedness incident that sent me back to bed (this one being slightly worse). I experience slight chest pain in my upper right chest muscle. It took me a day to recover from this spell. I constantly felt weak and as if I was about to faint. I went to the doctor two days later and got blood work done and measured my blood pressure. Everything came back normal. On Saturday June 19th, I had another near-fainting experience in a public setting. My hearing changed, I couldn&#39;t think straight, I was very shaky and weak, and I tried to drink a lot of water. Nothing helped so I went home and once I got in bed I was aggressively shaking. Since then I have been bed-ridden for the week, and unable to do normal activities such as go for walks, exercise, or go to work. I am going to visit a cardiologist tomorrow.

The patient was then told to sit in the waiting area for 20 minutes. After about 1 minute he fell out of his chair in the waiting area and passed out. He was out for about 2 minutes until he came to. The pharmacist on duty tended to him and put a frozen water bottle on his neck. He was helped into his chair where he sat for about 5 minutes until he started to feel light headed again. At this point he went back to laying on the floor for about 15 minutes.  Once he was feeling well enough again, he moved back up into the chair. After a total of 45 minutes the patient called a ride and left to return home.

The ambulance was called and I was checked in place. ever since I got the vaccine I started feeling my heart rhythm changed, either my heart is slowing down or it beats really fast or get a discomfort  feeling in heart and get the feeling  of passing out again. This made me loose my appetite to eat for several days. On two instances, i went to the emergency room. I&#39;ve been following up with my doctor about this issue.  The discomfort will happen every several days. Before getting the vaccine I had none of the symptoms.
