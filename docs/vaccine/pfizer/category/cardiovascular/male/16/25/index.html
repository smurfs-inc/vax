His mother gently lowered him to the ground (@ 1804). Patient&#39;s mother stated he just passed out and that this was his first injection ever in his life. Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient&#39;s legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling &#34;a star&#34; on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%. Immediately after the patient passed out the second time, his pulse was measured at 38 bpm and his lips displayed slight cyanosis. His pulse quickly rose to 52 bpm, within less than 10 seconds. One minute later his pulse was up to 68 bpm.

                                                High blood sugars for a week now.  My son is 16 year&#39;s old and was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in November.  He is thin and active, and an otherwise healthy teen and runner.  He is in his &#34;honeymoon phase&#34; of diabetes and I think the vaccine may be killing off beta cells.  He went from having blood sugar levels in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s at 12 units of Lantus to now 120&#39;s to 130&#39;s and up to 160&#39;s immediately after the shot.  His mealtime insulin is also not working at the same number of units and he&#39;s going in the 200&#39;s when he was around 160&#39;s before the shot. It has lasted now for a week instead of the 48 hours I was told about and read about.   As soon as we were leaving from getting his vaccine, he started experiencing extreme fatigue.  That night and for 2 days he had a headache.  He is still more tired than usual and having to take naps.

A minute later, his mom was calling that he was having a reaction.  A technician called 911 while I went to check.  He passed out for just a moment and came to quickly.   His mom said he was ok but paramedics arrived within minutes and were checking him out.  His blood pressure was super low and they monitored him and took over.  They were gone within probably 10 minutes.

At further inspection I noticed that he was having a rash . I had a sit for a few more minutes then his mom came up and we noticed that his arm started to swell. We gave him 2 capsules Benadryl 25mg and instructed him to go to urgent care. Called for a follow up later in the evening and found that urgent care send him to the ER. The rash was spread all over and well as the swelling. He swelled all the way to his toes. He also tuned white and became very lightheaded at the ER. They gave him IV Benadryl and dexamethasone and was sent home. It has been recommended by the ER doctors to not get the 2nd dose.

Father brought him to the ER for evaluation. His emergency department evaluation showed ST elevations most notably in the inferior and lateral leads as well as in the lateral precordium.

                                                pt fainted after receiving his 1st dose of Pfizer.   He fell out of his chair and hit head on the ground.  He fainted 1-2 more times after initial collapse. EMS came and he reported being fine after about 10 minutes after the incident. Patient admitted to not eating anything before his shot.  He was fine and when follow up call occurred, indicated he wanted to get his 2nd dose in three weeks and we will take precautions and eat food and sit on a carpeted floor against a wall in case he faints again.

Noted the following day this his eyes looked yellow, more that usual, and came to the clinic on 3/1/21 for evaluation.  was feeling better but due to acute jaundice had blood work that indicated markedly elevated bilirubin and low platelets.  Further testing for hepatitis was negative.  Was sent to the ER the following day as we were unable to get blood drawn and GI consult was desired.  There he had a normal abdominal US and bilirubin had dropped and he has since been followed by GI and is currently being evaluated by Hematology for any underlying conditions that may be contributing.

                                                Patient presented to the emergency department early March 28, 2021 after experiencing 5-7 hours of chest pain. The chest started when the patient went to bed the evening of March 27, where he began having substernal non-radiating chest pain with inspiration. The pain was relieved by sitting upright and by taking some acetaminophen. He received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on March 25 (first dose was March 5). He was initially treated with ketorolac 15mg IV and given 1 liter of lactated ringer&#39;s solution via IV.  His chest pain resolved after this. He was eventually given colchicine 0.6mg twice daily and ibuprofen 600mg 3 times daily due to concern for myopericarditis. He was ultimately found to have no evidence of pericarditis after undergoing a cardiac MRI, thus colchicine and ibuprofen were discontinued. Due to findings of mildly reduced ejection fraction on imaging, he was started on metoprolol XL 25mg once daily at discharge.

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm at the age of 18-year-old on 07Apr2021 09:50 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing congenital diaphragmatic hernia (that prevented his lungs from developing before he was born). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (FLU) for immunization and without a reaction. Caller is a consumer, calling about his 18 years son who received the covid vaccine this morning and had an adverse event afterwards. Caller reported that his 18 years son had his first covid vaccine dose this morning. He has had all of his vaccinations, even the flu shot every year without a reaction. After having his covid vaccination, on the way home he said he started feeling light headed. He was supposed to go back to school once they got home but the caller noticed that his son hadn&#39;t left yet because he drives himself. He reported that his son&#39;s room is downstairs and when he looked his son was laying down at the bottom of the stairs and appears to have passed out. He reports that now he is fine and he has eaten. Calling now because he was concerned and &#34;wanted to make sure there was nothing else I should do in this situation&#39;&#39;. Caller stated that he took his two kids to get their vaccines. His son is 18 years old and his daughter will be 18 next Tuesday.Stated that they stayed at the site in case of a reaction to the vaccine and nothing happened. On the way back home the son became lightheaded. Caller thought maybe he needed to eat even though he had eaten a light breakfast before they went to get the vaccines. Stated his son got home and passed out. Caller had never seen his son pass out before. Said his son fell down the stairs while going to the basement where is room is located. Caller was concerned this could&#39;ve been a reaction and is calling to see if there is anything further they should be concerned about. The son&#39;s vaccine, lightheadedness, passing out, and falling all took placed today 07Apr2021. Caller said he nor his son are certain if he was injured during the fall. His son thinks he hit his head and his knee and noticed that his shorts where ripped behind the leg on 07Apr2021.  Caller states his son says he is feeling back to normal and fine. The son was supposed to go to school after the vaccine but the caller had him stay home so he could keep an eye on him. Caller stated it was scary. The caller opened the door and saw his son lying on the floor with the gum he had bought at the drug store strewn out everywhere. Caller stated they are believers in vaccines. Stated his son used to have a part time job at the grocery store bagging groceries for customers and was wanting to go back to work. Caller also said that his son was born with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia that prevented his lungs from developing before he was born. Caller stated that due to this him and his wife felt it was best for the son to get the vaccine since if he got the Covid virus it could have been really bad for him. Caller denies any medications, labs, testing or treatments that are relevant to these events. Caller stated his son is healthy. Stated when his son mentioned being lightheaded in the car, the caller didn&#39;t think much of it. The outcome of events was recovered on 07Apr2021.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

Vaccinator describes 20-30 seconds of full body shaking. Patient then awoke and was Alert and oriented to people, place and time within 2 minutes. He was nauseas and anxious initially. Onsite EMS was alerted immediately and came to access the patient. 911 was also called quickly under the assumption it may have been a seizure. Patient denied any seizure history. Father arrived a few hours later to pick up patients vehicle and dog. Father informed me that patient was doing better at this point and was being prepared for departure.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

On the day prior to arrival he developed increasing shortness of breath particularly with talking and with ambulation.  He also describes chest tightness with deep inspiration, the tightness radiates to back, no radiation to left arm or jaw.  Chest tightness is non-positional, but does feel worse immediately after he lies down from ambulation and then slowly dissipates.  His last subjective fever was yesterday evening.  He has never had a reaction to the vaccine before.  He has no allergies.  No prior medical conditions he is aware of, and takes no medications.  He did not experience any of the symptoms following the first vaccine. He has h/o asymptomatic COVID infection in November 2020. Cardiology consulted for concern of pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccine. He does not have significant ST elevation or PR depression.  He also does not have evidence of significant pericardial effusion at this point.  The high sensitivity troponins are mildly elevated.  He does have viral syndrome.  Is unclear if Covid vaccination was causally related to his symptoms.  We would like to improve his medications for better chest pain control and to prevent recurrent pericarditis in the future.

Throughout the day after the injection 4-10-2021 these symptoms improved but did not completely resolve. Overnight from the 10th into the morning of the 11th I developed a cough and felt short of breath. The afternoon of the 11th my oxygen saturation began to drop upon light exertion (walking around inside my home). I checked in to the Emergency Dept. at around 7 p.m. on the 11th of April 2021. I had elevated D-dimer, and abnormal Troponin. I was admitted with a diagnosis of myocarditis.

Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

                                                When reviewing forms with patient the patient disclosed a shellfish allergy. He described the symptoms of his skin turning red, shaking, and swelling in his throat as swelling in the past. He indicated that he had needed to use an epi pen in the past for his allergy.  He still wanted the vaccination and knew we had an epi pen handy.  He was given the vaccination in his left arm and was set up next to the staff development employee who was timing and monitoring patient&#39;s for symptoms. An epi pen was given to the monitor so it would be handy.  The patient&#39;s right hand started shaking within a minute and it was hard to tell if it was from being anxious.  Patient continued to communicate verbally and stated he wanted to use the epi pen.  911 was called by the staff and the staff member with the epi pen took it and the patient out of the main area. Paramedics transported him to the hospital with slight tachycardia and never did administer epi pen while in facility. Patient was always conscious and able to verbally communicate.

She also gave him a wet rag to wipe his forehead. He was given two teaspoonful of Benadryl 12.5mg/ 5ml. The patient stated that he was feeling dizzy and thought he was going to faint. The pharmacy called 911. The patient removed his jacket and mask as he was hot. The EMT arrived and walked him outside* I am not sure what happened after that

A 22-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/ Lot Number and expiry date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 (at the age of 22-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food or other products. Patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks of vaccination. Patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Patient has not COVID, prior vaccination. On 03Apr2021, the patient appears to have developed acute myopericarditis within 3 days of receiving the vaccine (adverse event result in Emergency room/department or urgent care). Patient received treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and colchicine. Patient has been tested for COVID in 2021, post vaccination, Test type: Nasal Swab and result was negative. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Additional information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the known vaccine safety profile the causal association between the reported event patient appears to have developed acute myopericarditis within 3 days of receiving the vaccine and the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 is unlikely but cannot be completely excluded because of strong temporal association between the event and the suspected vaccine. The case will be assessed once the new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 22-years-old male patient (Son) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. My son is having a tough time with the vaccine. Everyday he has a couple of side effects. He started with body ache and tiredness on unspecified date Apr2021. He had a pounding headache. His headache was moderate today. However, the headache symptoms are getting worst. Generally, the symptoms last a day his have been getting worst for 7 days. He has been taking Tylenol and Advil. But the Advil doesn&#39;t even seem to hep anymore.&#34; headache is a common side effect reported with the vaccine. If the symptoms persists or get worst please consult your HCP. Please note blood clot has not been associated with the vaccine. Patient is been experiencing what I considered to be pretty severe, I guess reaction in term of aches and headache. This morning he woke up with the pounding headache, he kid described it as pounding and I just I guess I want to ask because everywhere I read, it says mild headaches are common and aches and I understand that but I guess understanding why this, this is considered somewhat as severe reaction or is there anything he can do to alleviate the symptom and should he, I guess my question is actually I guess my question also is should he not possibly get the second dose if he is experiencing such bad headaches with the first dose. When paraphrased the concern, reporter stated, Yes, basically we are thinking if can do to alleviate it and then he could not get the second dose, if you have any advice, I guess and just let you know he went to his health center in the college he went to get a COVID test and a flu test just to make sure he doesn&#39;t have actual Covid or flu and those report I got yesterday and so they told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. When probed for event start date, reporter stated, I would say a day after, I would say 09Apr2021, I guess it&#39;s phantom (not clarified) with symptom, the first day he was just tired, as far as the headache that started on the 09Apr2021. He (son) also passed out after the vaccine, which I also did that I didn&#39;t have Pfizer I (reporter) had Moderna and I had that same reaction, so I think that sometimes happens to some people but that&#39;s it happens also. When probed for vaccination anatomical site, reporter stated, Outside of the body I guess, I don&#39;t know that for sure. Patient still having the problem (event), and out event outcome, reporter stated, Yes, I think persisting, I think it varies. Patient has been taking Advil (Ibuprofen) and Tylenol (treatment). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included influenza virus test: negative on 12Apr2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 12Apr2021. They told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of body ache (pain), tiredness (fatigue), pounding headache/headache symptoms are getting worst (headache). The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  QR Comment: Call handler not filed split case. Might have been split case.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

I just need some sugar like juice.&#34; He denied difficulty breathing or chest pain. He was not nauseous nor did he vomit. I transported him to a private holding room via wheelchair and gave him a 12 oz can of Coca-Cola. He took sips and immediately reported feeling better. The initial vital signs I took were as follows: Temp 98.6 F, HR 67, BP 84/48 mmHg, RR 24/min, and SpO2 97%.  After recheck in 15 min BP improved to 106/62 mmHg, his became more pink and no more diaphoresis. I observed him for 30 minutes total and he was stable to go home. He drove himself home.

He then became very pale and fainted while in the vaccination chair. After a few seconds he regained consciousness. We then helped him to the floor and elevated his legs and placed a cold pack on his neck. He started feeling better instantly but we kept him there for about 5 minutes. We then had him move to a chair and the technician sat with him for an additional 40 minutes. He then said he was fine and that he has fainted before (which was not disclosed) and left.

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EN6206) single dose, in the left arm, on 08Mar2021, at 11:45 AM, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had not received any other medications within 2 weeks. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not experienced COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Mar2021, at 12:00 PM, 5 minutes after vaccination, the patient became very light-headed. In a few seconds his vision went dark and he passed out. After an unknown amount of time, he became semiconscious and was hyperventilating. While hyperventilating, his eyes were open, but he could not see anything. Once he caught his breath, after about 15 seconds, his vision came back and he lost all awareness of where he was. After about 30 seconds, the patient realized he was in the observation area for the facility and alerted the medical professionals near his vehicle he was sitting in. Medical professionals checked his vitals, which were fine other than an elevated heart rate, and he had a tingling sensation over his body for the next two minutes. In this time, he was unable to form cohesive sentences, and his muscles movements were impeded. It took another 40 minutes to return to a relatively normal state. No treatment was received. The patient recovered from the adverse events. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

                                                On Saturday night (4/10) I had some chest pains that seemed to not go away in my upper left chest and left arm. I tried to sleep it off until the pain was unbearable at around 7:00 am on Monday (4/11). I then admitted myself to the ER and was given an ECG and multiple EKG?s as well. Upon lab results I had high triponin levels (28) leading the doctors to believe I had a heard attack of some sort, eventually they ruled it as acute pericarditis possibly due to my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

A 23-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 25Jan2021 (Lot Number: EL3247), as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient was vaccinated in the hospital. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient did not have known allergies. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Previously the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech, lot# EL0142) on 04Jan2021 at 11:30 AM in left arm and experienced nodule on extremity and vaccination site nodule. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis leg (medically significant, life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, nodule on both forearm (life threatening) on 25Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, swelling along veins and they became painful (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, swelling along veins and they became painful (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, 2 superficial venous thromboses, one in arm and another in leg (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered. It was reported that within hours from second dose the nodules reappeared. At this time, patient was told to take Allegra and did so for 4 weeks. A month later, patient began to see some swelling along his veins and they became painful. This developed into a DVT, deep venous thrombosis, in leg and 2 superficial venous thromboses, one in arm and another in leg. all the events required physician office visit. None of the events occurred at vaccination site, but physician believed they were triggered by receiving the vaccine. Treatment of Eliquis was initiated the day before report. Patient was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

Staff grabbed him and held him back onto the seat, proceeded to picked up his right arm and held him in place. He looked unconscious while staff held him. He came back to his senses approximately 10 seconds later. After he regained consciousness, staff took his blood pressure which was 111/44, SpO2 was 100%, and heart rate 58. Patient looked pale but not critical. Conversed with our staff and stated that this has happened before when he receives other vaccinations.

We gave him water and he left after sitting for a while.

                                                On Friday morning 2/26/21, we had a 24 yo male patient who had an anaphylactic reaction after his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He was instructed to wait on the chair, but had stood up at some point but was still in the pharmacy waiting area. A team member noticed he had fainted and called for help. The pharmacist on duty and immunizing tech came immediately to help him to a chair. At that point, he was conscious and talking. Then within a few seconds he started convulsing on the chair and lost consciousness. His eyes were open and head tilted back. A team member immediately called 911 and pharmacist administered 0.3mg Epipen to the thigh. We removed his face mask to check his breathing and also to allow him to breathe more easily. We also adjusted his head more forward and he started coughing. After about 15 seconds, he regained consciousness and could answer questions. EMT arrived soon after and took over. Patient does not have allergies or any history of anaphylaxis/ severe reaction from vaccinations. He did express some fear of needles and did not eat breakfast yet.

I was then moved to the observation area where my chest got tight, I had difficulty breathing and my temperature fluctuated which made me shake. When hives began to show on my face, neck and ears the on-site medical staff gave me a shot of epinephrine and Benadryl and put me on oxygen, during this time an ambulance was called by the staff. When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

A 24-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158; Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eye allergy. Concomitant medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AMOXICILINA CLAV) taken for eye allergy from 12Apr2021. On 14Apr2021, he received the first dose of the vaccine about an hour ago and waited five minutes and went to the bathroom. He had a severe reaction while patient was in the bathroom, he started to feel dizzy, had a terrible headache and chills. He walked out of the bathroom at the store and fell out completely in front of the pharmacists. The patient also experienced weak with shilling (as reported) and started sweating. The pharmacists called 911 and the responders checked his vitals and blood pressure and all of that and everything was fine. Patient clarified he passed out completely for almost 5 minutes. Patient stayed there with everyone until, they were waiting to see how he was doing. He reported he was feeling much better now, still feel a bit dizzy, not 100% but not as bad as when it happened. It has improved and he definitely felt terrible at the time. He was monitoring himself at home to see if he notices something weird going on. He does not have a headache right now and was feeling much better. When he was having the effect, he was mentally sharp, and knew what was going on. He thought about letting himself walk outside the bathroom so he could be seen. He didn&#39;t lose track of what was going on and body reacted adversely. He remembered stuff and everything and he felt good. Patient stated the chills went away; however, would not say they went away completely, he was recovering. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office and the paramedic said it was not necessary right now because all the vitals and everything else seemed fine. There was no therapy received for the events. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the vaccine and no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of events feeling dizzy, terrible headache, chills was recovering; still feeling very sick was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

                                                Severe apneic episodes with sleep. I have no history of sleep apnea, BMI of 24, exercise regularly, no known snoring. The night after my first dose at around 23:00 while falling asleep I shortly after having been asleep would wake up gasping for air.  Attempting to fall back asleep I felt the need to consciously make myself breathe, and when I would fall asleep no more than 5-10 after I would wake up gasping for air. This continued on until around close to 03:00 on 1/7/21. When I finally fell asleep around 03:00 woke up gasping for air around 04:45 and never fell back asleep. The next two nights, 1/7/21 and 1/8/21 I would have trouble falling asleep because these same apneic episodes were happening until around 03:00. The night of 1/9/21 I had no issues sleeping, and have had no apnea since those three nights.  These apneic episodes were followed by extreme anxiety from being unable to sleep fully (I worried moreso about not falling asleep than the apnea). Heart rate when counted ranged for 70s-80s and my normal HR while sleeping is around low 50s.

                                                The patient reported that they were experiencing tightness in their arm and believed it swelled initially. They left the pharmacy area and went to get Tylenol that was recommended by the pharmacist. They then began to get lightheaded and had syncope, attempted to get back up and the cashier asked to if they wanted to sit, but fell again. It was not clear initially to the employee who was helping them they had received the vaccine. 911 was called and the employee helping them let the pharmacist know they had just gotten their vaccine. The immunizing pharmacist went to check on the patient. EMTs were already helping the patient and had taken his blood pressure which was normal the lightheadedness had stopped and both sitting and standing blood pressure was the same. He had an elevated heart rate per the patient but didn&#39;t know any of the numbers the EMTs had taken. His father was driving him. He was not experiencing any symptoms and the injection site had no swelling and was otherwise unremarkable.
