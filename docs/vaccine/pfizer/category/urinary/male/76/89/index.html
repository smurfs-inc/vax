He received first Pfizer COVID vaccination at noon time this past Thursday 25Feb in a vaccination clinic set up, the following day Friday the 26 he woke up the next morning and entire body was so sore from head to toe and could hardly get himself out of bed, but when he got up, he was having difficulty walking, so anyway he stayed in bed all day on 26 and 27. He initially had a slight temperature, some chills, slight cough, runny nose and those symptoms except for the cough seem to have resolved, what hasn&#39;t resolved is about every 30 or 40 minutes or so he had been having to urinate ever since 26Feb2021 night, his mouth has been constantly very dry. Still urinating every half hour 45 minutes and ongoing. Mouth has been very dry and had a couple of areas where it seems like maybe he had bit his lip or something, maybe when he was sleeping. It was nothing like that in mouth anymore but the mouth is still constantly so dry like dehydrated and no matter how much of fluid he drank that doesn&#39;t seem to help it and what in fact has also caused was on yesterday morning he had been a little constipated on Friday night and then yesterday morning had a severe case of diarrhea. Now he had not had another bowel movement since yesterday morning as no appetite and feeling so lousy, and so tired and fatigued. He had been feeling even much worse since getting the vaccine. He still feels very fatigued, very sore all over, very tired, still have the slight cough and he would say that&#39;s about it. Outcome of events for cough, pain and tiredness was not recovered and for the rest of the events it was unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Treatment team COVID-19 virus infection Principal problem HPI: For complete history and physical see the H&amp;P dictated by Dr. on 4/28/2021.  This is a 76-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with upper respiratory symptoms for three days.  He reports having cough, sneezing, runny nose and poor appetite.  His caregiver had Covid recently and he was exposed.  He was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.   Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted inpatient to the medical surgical floor.  He was not on telemetry.  Patient reports that his caregiver had recently tested positive for Covid and he was exposed.  He has been having upper respiratory symptoms including cough, sneezing, and runny nose.  His COVID-19 test was positive.       He was started on the COVID-19 treatment protocol which included IV remdesivir and IV dexamethasone.  He underwent a CT scan of the chest which showed small patchy areas of groundglass infiltrates in the peripheral portions of the left and right upper lobes and also the posterior aspects of the right lung base.  These findings are probably due to pneumonia.        Hospital course consisted of gentle hydration with IV normal saline.  He was also started on antibiotic therapy oral azithromycin and IV Rocephin.  He had completed the course of antibiotics while on the unit, therefore, at the time of discharge no antibiotics were prescribed.  He initially was hypoxic and started on nasal cannula oxygen to maintain pulse oximetry greater than 92%.  Eventually, oxygen was weaned and pulse oximetry on room air has remained in the 95-96% range.       He has a history of diabetes mellitus and while on the unit blood glucose levels have fluctuated.  His point-of-care glucose have been in the 80-500 range.  He has had numerous episodes of hypoglycemia and insulin has been adjusted.  The fluctuations of the blood glucose levels may be secondary to IV dexamethasone.  At the time of discharge he will continue dexamethasone 6mg daily for the next three days.  He was advised to increase insulin 70/25 insulin five units daily for the next thre days.  After that time he can return to his normal dose of insulin.  He also had been treated with IV remdesivir and had completed the 5-day course.      On examination today he has been asymptomatic.  He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  The initial lab studies showed an elevated creatinine level, although he has a history of chronic kidney disease.  At the time of discharge the creatinine level trended downward and he was advised to follow-up with the primary care provider for possible repeat BMP in 1 to 2 weeks.  All other lab studies have been within normal limits.        The systolic blood pressure has been in the 120-150 range.  The most recent systolic blood pressure was 151/66 mmHg with a heart rate of 66 bpm.  He denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.  He was advised to continue all of his current medications.  While on the unit he was in isolation secondary to COVID-19.  At the time of discharge he should maintain social distancing/isolation, mask wearing and good handwashing.  He will will need to follow-up with the primary care provider.  He was also advised if the oxygen level dips below 89% he will need to return to the emergency department.  At this time he is resting comfortably, offers no complaints and is stable for discharge.       Patient is alert, oriented answering all questions appropriately.  He is continent of bowel and bladder.   Heis able to make his own decisions.  He is able to performhis own ADLs.  .  At this time he is in agreement with the plan and feels comfortable to be discharged home. Thank you.

Patient transferred from Spinal Cord Injury until to ICU on 1/11/2021 due to worsneing dyspnea, hypoxia (80s) and tachycardia and was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure likely 2/2 multifocal pneumonia. CXR findings of &#34;There is interval increase in patchy airspace infiltrates and consolidation in bilateral lungs concerning for pneumonia&#34; Patient was started on vancomycin and pip/tazo on 1/11 and tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained for VAP diagnosis which ultimately grew Serratia liquifaciens and Proteus mirabilis. Infectious Diseases was consulted who recommended a switch to ertapenem therapy for a total 10 day course for VAP. UCx/BCx remained negative. On 1/20, a therapeutic bronchoscopy was completed with cultures growing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and pan-S Klebsiella pneumoniae. The following day a chest tube was inserted and the course of ertapenem completed but vancomycin was continued. By 1/22, patient developed shock liver with ALT/AST 2135/1579 from normal range the day prior and SCr increased to 1.3 from baseline 0.7/cystatin C of 2.46 up from 1.15.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6202 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and stage 4 kidney disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Feb2021 (Saturday), patient was not feeling well and on 28Feb2021, he had diarrhea, chills, shaking all over, severe headache and started throwing up. Reporter stated patient had all the symptoms of the reactions and then &#34;you go again to the serious, more dangerous symptoms, he has all of them&#34;. Throwing up, fever, chills, diarrhea and then he get real hot and then he started sweating and it was another day on 01Mar2021. On Monday (01Mar2021), reporter called to take patient to the hospital with high fever. The ambulance put him on IV and oxygen right away. They gave him fluids and were monitoring everything because he was dehydrated and then he stayed in the hospital for some time. He had x-rays, they monitored his blood pressure and heart rate, and the doctor was concerned about his heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor decided to check his urine and he did and he had a UTI on 01Mar2021, and so he gave him antibiotics for that (treatment unspecified). Patient seemed to be better after having the fluids and everything so they let him come home. During the night on 01Mar2021, he had another attack and it was the same thing that he had before. The shaking and the chills the fever and throwing up and the doctor said that it was a reaction from having the vaccination and reporter just wanted to report that he did and reported actually thought he was going to die. Reporter tried to call again the ambulance since she thought that he was not going to make it. The doctor put on the report and he did not put on there that he was in there because of suspected of (incomplete sentence) and then told the reporter himself that he had a reaction from the vaccine. The report stated that patient was in for a UT, but the reporter stated that, once does not call an ambulance for a UTI and she (reporter), have UTI&#39;s all the time. After the reporter got the patient home, he was even much worse. Patient could not breathe and he was struggling to breathe on 01Mar2021. He was shivering, shaking, having diarrhea, throwing up, soaking wet, and she had to change his clothes twice, and his fever was 103.1 F around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning of 02Mar2021. The pharmacist gave medicine for vomiting. Reporter called the hospital and the nurses were busy and they could not take it so 24 hour nurse called. She was finally able to get him comfortable enough that she didn&#39;t have to call again. She thought she was going lose him. She said she felt twice he was going to die, when she called. At the hospital they told him he was having a severe reaction to the vaccine but also had a UTI and they gave him antibiotics. Patient contacted her nephew who is a medic in the military and RN and he said patient has Covid and thinks reporter has Covid too because the virus was in the vaccine. The nephew explained that patient just could not fight it off and said the vaccine acts like that. It made sense because it is inhibit in it then your body will learn to fight it off, like if you come in contact with it and that makes sense but the woman never explained. The nephew further stated to reported that patient&#39;s immune system or whatever was not able to fight it off. So, he said he has to have Covid and when patient heard that after all they had fought to stay away from it and then what were they supposed to do. Patient got the vaccine and ended up with it and that is what reporter have found out and it was very disturbing. Patient was running a 103.1 earlier on the night of 02Mar2021. He was moaning a little bit on Mar2021. Reporter thought patient had severe allergic reaction to the vaccine because he had all the symptoms and stated there was no doubt in her mind (referring to it being an allergic reaction) as it was too soon after the vaccine. Outcome of the event of dehydration was recovering, while for the remaining events was unknown. Reporter was asking if patient should take the second shot.

EMS notes that upon their arrival the pt had a right sided facial droop along with some contracture to his left side.  Pt was originally awake and confused as he gradually became unresponsive and is only responsive to pain of sternal rub. He has no history of stroke. Pt&#39;s BP was noted to be 88/50&#39;s en route.

After the second dose of vaccine, the hematuria worsened so much so that he was just leaking blood from the urethra even without urination. With urination he was passing frank blood and clots.  He stopped clopidogrel and aspirin and it totally resolved.  He underwent cystoscopy and there were no lesions identified.  He resumed clopidogrel and aspirin and has not had any more bleeding.

Uncommonly tired, no headache fever, chills, or neurodeficit otherwise.  ( I am a retired physician).  This lead to change in gait: slow, foot dragging, unstable.  Near accident in driving auto.  More than 4 time of urinary incontinence ie incontinence when bladder overfilled.  Mental clarity lost.  speech impaired by word searching.  Obvious change in behavior to those around me.

A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in Mar2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included carbidopa and levodopa. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. In Mar2021, the patient experienced onset of A-fib and resultant renal dysfunction shortly after injection. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with Cardioversion and medical management for the event A-fib. The outcome of the events was recovered on unspecified date.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events of Atrial Fibrillation and Renal Impairment and the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed once new information is available.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This is a 77 years old gentleman with a history of COPD presents to the emergency department because of shortness of breath and chest pain.  Patient states that he was in his usual state of health and suddenly developed shortness of breath and chest tightness. By the time of my evaluation he no longer has chest tightness.  He was recently in the hospital and treated with antibiotics for Pseudomonas pneumonia.  He is reportedly compliant with his COPD medications at home.  He normally wears 2 L nasal cannula at home.  Currently he is on the BiPAP and reports feeling better after treatment in the emergency department.  He was given IV steroids, bronchodilator therapy.  He was also given IV antibiotics given recent history of Pseudomonas pneumonia.  Of note patient states that for the past week his bilateral ankle appears to be more swollen and he is on Lasix started by Dr. from pulmonology for this.  6/21/21: This patient with a history of COPD, atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation and chronic dementia, was again admitted 6/16 with increasing shortness of breath and chest pain.  It was noted that his COVID 19 test was positive.  He was started on IV Remdesivir, but since his COVID 19 test has been positive since March of this year was felt that he did not require additional treatment.  We are treating him for an exacerbation of COPD.  His chest x-ray was actually normal with COPD but no signs of infiltrate, heart failure or effusions.  He is on apixaban for atrial fibrillation and should not have a pulmonary emboli.  He was getting IV Lasix, but the BUN and creatinine were rising.  We have obtained an echocardiogram to see if there is a degree of systolic heart failure.  We will continue the IV antibiotics and steroid therapy.  The patient seems comfortable at rest but is on 5 L nasal cannula.  The patient reports that he is on 3 L of oxygen at home all the time.  I called to talk to the good friend who is listed as the 1st contact and reviewed the situation.  He does live by himself but has 24 hour a day care.  We discussed that our goal was to get him back down to 2-3 L of oxygen.  There seems to be some improvement but if still requires 5-6 L of oxygen, we will ask for a pulmonary consultation.  I have talked to the pulmonary team several times unofficially for advice and they seem to have nothing else to offer at this time.  Again today the patient seems comfortable and is warning why he can go home.Admitted and treated with bronchodilators, steroids, BiPAP and levaquin. Echocardiogram repeated. By the time of admission, chest pain resolved. Oxygen requirement stay high at 5 liters. Today improved to baseline 2 L. Discharged home.

                                                Kidney stones; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; Batch/Lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included nephrolithiasis (before getting the COVID shot). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced kidney stones on an unspecified date. The patient explained that he was scheduled for the second COVID shot on Wednesday. He noted that he has developed a kidney stone and wanted to know if it was ok to get the second dose. It was confirmed that he was used to the pain and has had a bunch of them in the past; he has a history of kidney stones before getting the COVID shot. He stated that he wanted to go ahead and get the shot, the appointments were so hard to get. Outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                On Eliquis and on and off had bloody urine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, based on information received by Pfizer from Bristol-Myers Squibb (manufacturer control number US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY-BMS-2021-020443), license party for apixaban (ELIQUIS).  This spontaneous case was reported by a patient family member or friend and describes the occurrence of haematuria (On Eliquis and on and off had bloody urine) in 78-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) for Cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis. Co-Suspect Products included Covid-19 Vaccine for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s past medical history included Prostate cancer (about 10 years ago), Radiation therapy and Capillary fragility. On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (unknown route). On 24-Feb-2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (unknown route). On an unknown date, the patient experienced haematuria (On Eliquis and on and off had bloody urine). The action taken with Eliquis (Unknown) was unknown. At the time of the report, haematuria resolved. Event reoccurred on 24-Feb-2021 For Eliquis (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments. The reporter stated that the patient got the Covid vaccine the previous day, he had a history of prostate cancer from about 10 years ago and was treated by radiation, the radiation had caused capillaries in the penis to be fragile and so sometimes when he urinate, he urinate blood or little blood clots, neurologist was aware of it, cardiologist was aware of it but they did not treat it, they just waited for it to resolve itself. He was also on Eliquis for a Atrial fib so the previous day when we came home after he got the vaccine, he was bleeding with the clots and with the bloody urine which he had done in the past. He had a blood urine one hour post vaccination. She was shocked. It would take at least a few hours for the medication to get in the system before having any kind of reaction. It resolved on it&#39;s own he did not have a blood urine anymore. The second dose of the vaccine was due on 16-Mar-2021.

                                                Received his vaccine, he had soreness in the arm, but  nothing else.  On 3/3/21 he went to hospital ER with diagnosis of kidney stones, had a morphine injection, Flomax and a prescription for Oxycontin and Flomax.  At that time he was experiencing also in his right eye swelling and it was reddish, and there was an itching around the eye, and there was a couple blotches on top of his head and his cheek, but did not mention it as he was there for kidney stones.  On 3/9/2021 he saw a Urologist, Dr. and that morning he passed a kidney stone.  The urologist took an x-ray and did not see any more.  The eye then became an issue on 3/9/21 and he made an appointment to see the eye Dr., Dr. at Eye institute on 3/11/21 @ 9:00 AM.  The doctor diagnosed shingles on the face and right eye, and she put him on 2 medications (Durezol ophthalmic drops).  He is still on that medication still 4/16/21.  The other medication that they prescribed for him was Valacyclovir which he took 3 times a day, they reduced it from 1000 mg to 500 mg twice a day.   The swelling of the eye itself has gone down a little bit.  He is still seeing the eye doctor, and has a FU on 5/5/21 as it is getting better but still has symptoms.   He did get a single dose Shingrix shot a couple of years ago.

                                                Male patient who to the hospital on 3/15/2021 due to 10 days of shortness of breath on exertion and right-sided chest pain.   He went to his PCP for follow-up and had a CT PE study today which was positive for right upper lobe and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism.  He notes that he received a 2nd 5 0 COVID-19 vaccination on March 6th and since then has not felt well, feeling short of breath and generally fatigued.  He notes that he has not been very active since receiving the vaccine.   CT PE study showed an increased RV to LV ratio 1.2.  He had no elevation in his troponin or BNP.  His echocardiogram showed an EF of 60% and there were no wall motion abnormalities and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient would prefer Eliquis at this time.  He will need a 6 month course of Eliquis.  Given the setting of recent COVID vaccination and recent decreased mobility as possible provoking factors, this will be treated as a provoked pulmonary embolus.  Per hospital COVID vaccine protocol, patient presentation will be reported to pharmacy for FDA reporting.

A 80-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection,Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included bypass surgery. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Jan2021, the patient experienced headache, minor aches, had a cough, muscles were tightening, could hardly walk, lethargic, chills and heart attack on an unspecified date. Caller states that on 14Jan2021 she and her husband had the 1st Pfizer vaccine dose. 2nd dose was scheduled on 04Feb2021. Caller reporter that 2 days after the 1st dose, her husband&#39;s muscles were tightening, could hardly walk, had a cough, was lethargic, had chills and was c/o having reflux in his chest. Caller stated they had appointments that day with their Internist and their Cardiologist. Both HCPs felt all his symptoms were probably from the vaccine. That night she took him to the ER and he had had a heart attack. They did a cardiac Cath and had one of two stents put in. His kidneys were compromised and the HCP couldn&#39;t give the amount of dye needed to add another stent. So he still needs another stent. Also the blood count went down. Caller states her husband had cardiac bypass surgery years ago. The caller also mentioned her son is a surgeon and had bad flu like symptoms after second shot and only had a headache and minor aches after the first dose. She was concerned about her husband as he had a heart attack and if he should get the 2nd dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood count: went down. Outcome of the events were unknown.  Upon follow-up on 16Apr2021: This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

                                                Patient is a 81 y.o. gentleman with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma, urinary retention for which he self catheterizes twice daily, as well as recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation that presents complaining of increasing weakness and falls.  Patient fell 2/18 pm trying to get out of bed and he took about 20 minutes to get himself to a position where he could pull himself back up.  Again 2/19 he was trying to get up and his legs were too weak to carry him and he fell to the ground.  He needed assistance to get up and family asked him to come to emergency room for evaluation.  He has been feeling poorly for about a month, with poor appetite and has lost about 15 pounds.  He is not nauseated or short of breath and has no cough.  He was apparently treated for UTI about 4 to 6 weeks ago after a visit to urgent care.  He has since been to a different urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was referred to a cardiologist who is planning to do a stress test in a few weeks.  I believe he is on Eliquis now.  In ER he was found to have significant pyuria and bacteriuria and was given a dose of Rocephin.  Renal function shows worsening from levels in December although it is pretty stable over the past month from looking through other labs.

Without warning, he fell to the ground, losing control of bowel and bladder, although no seizure activity noted at the time.  He transiently lost consciousness and then woke up confused and combative.  Brought to emergency room and admitted with multiple rib fractures.  Initial brain imaging was negative but 24 hours later, noted to have small hemorrhagic brain contusion in left frontal/temporal region and a small subdural hematoma.  One day later, there was not noted to be any extension of the hemorrhage/hematoma.

Patient was recently diagnosed with a PE and bilateral DVT 4 weeks PTA and was on Eliquis for these.  Patient also has a history of lung cancer and COPD and is chronically on 4L O2 at home. A foley was placed by Urology in the ER and Eliquis was held due hematuria and changed to heparin drip upon admission.  In the ER, patient was tested for COVID per policy, and was found to be positive on 7/7/21 despite being fully vaccinated (1/24/21 and 2/14/21). Patient was admitted for further work-up and has not been started on COVID treatment due to patient being asymptomatic for COVID.  Pt&#39;s chest X-ray was negative for pneumonia.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Parkinson&#39;s disease from an unknown date. The doctor told him to make an appointment with his Parkinson&#39;s doctor and tell him, maybe that has something do with it. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced burning when he urinates for 2 weeks, a sharp pain where his navel is, and pain in his stomach on Jan2021. He was wondering if it could be from the shot or if it is something else. He had an appointment with his doctor on Monday and he told him about it. The doctor gave him an antibiotic, Ciprofloxacin 500 mg that made him dizzy, he does not know if he will continue to take it but it helped the burning, the burning was not as bad. It was in a brown clear pharmacy bottle. The burning when he urinated is going away but the pain in his stomach comes and goes and it is right on his navel, it was described as a real hard pain. Patient would come back 03Feb2021 per vaccination card. Outcome of the event burning when he urinates was recovering while unknown for a sharp pain where his navel is, and pain in his stomach. The events were considered non-serious.

                                                Urinary tract infection; high blood pressure; Fall; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife) via the Pfizer sponsored program. An 83-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265, expiration date: 31Mau2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 13:12 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart surgery (Between 6-9 years before), Congestive heart failure, blood pressure (problems with blood pressure) and fall (history of falls). Concomitant medication included ongoing carvedilol for Congestive heart failure. The reporter stated that her husband has high blood pressure (occurred on an unspecified date) and was having problems falling. He fell the night of 03Feb2021. She called the paramedics to come help get him up. He was taken to the emergency room on the morning of 04Feb2021. He was found to have a urinary tract infection (on 04Feb2021) and was admitted. The patient was hospitalized for the event urinary tract infection on an unspecified date for 2 days. He is now in rehab and will have to learn to walk again. She is calling to ask what needs to be done about her husband getting the second dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: 150/90, CT scan, labs, urine test and X-rays: unknown, weight: 175-180 lbs on an unspecified date. Outcome of the event urinary tract infection was recovered with sequelae on 06Feb2021. Outcome of the event fall was recovered with sequelae on 03Feb2021 while outcome of the event blood pressure increased was recovering.

                                                Cardiac arrest Narrative:  An 82 year old, male, resident of a facility, received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12/30/20 (time of dose not known). On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name. Breathing was noted to be labored, and nurse was unable to detect a pulse. At 1509, 911 was called and CPR initiated. Spontaneous pulse and breathes resumed just before ambulance arrived at 1522. On arrival at the ED patient was responsive and breathing spontaneously, however, hemodynamically unstable. Patient went into cardiac arrest and code blue called at 1535. Received treatment with epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, amiodarone, atropine. Patient was intubated. EKG obtained and showed acute MI. At 1622 he again went into cardiac arrest and time of death was called.

Uncomplicated alcohol dependence (HCC) 05/05/2021 Yes   Resolved Hospital Problems No resolved problems to display.   CONSULTS: None    INPATIENT PROCEDURES: None   DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY:   PRESENTING PROBLEM: Patient is a 83 y.o. male with Hx of HTN who presents today with complaint of right sided flank pain, with radiations into the right side of his back and right side of his chest. The pain is worse with movement and deep inspiration. He denies palpitations and shortness of breath. He has no previous HX of VTE. He denies fever, chills, cough, nasal congestion, and sore throat. He denies abdominal pain, N/V, and changes in bowel movements. The patient is a limited historian. He is oriented x4 on admission, but states that he has had difficulty with his memory over the past 2-3 years. He lives alone in an apartment.   In the emergency department the patient&#39;s vital signs were stable.  Labs revealed a potassium of 3.3.  AST was 52 and ALT 61. White blood cell count was 11.13.  Troponin was negative and BNP was within normal limits.  Lactic acid was 1.5.  UA showed trace blood.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with PACs.  CTA the thorax abdomen and pelvis showed acute pulmonary emboli involving the segmental subsegmental arteries of the upper and lower lobes.  There is no evidence of heart strain. He was admitted for observation due to severe pain, and was given IV fentanyl.  Echocardiogram showed: The left ventricular ejection fraction is 67%. No regional wall motion abnormalities noted. The right ventricular size, thickness, and function are normal. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 36 mmHg. The inferior vena cava was not visualized during the exam. There is no comparison study available.    He was started on Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, than 5 mg bid for total of 3 months.  He should follow up with PCP in 1 week and should check CBC and BMP on 5/10/21. He should also follow up with pulmonologist in 2-3 months.  He had Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 2/18/21 and 3/18/21. There is remote possibility that this PE could be related to COVID-19 vaccine, so this was reported to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). He had mild hypokalemia due to HCTZ, and required K-dur supplement. HCTZ was switched to Maxzide 25/37.5 mg daily. Rechecked K was normal 3.9. BMP should be checked in 1 week. Also he is drinking little bit too much alcohol, 4 alcoholic drinks every night. He was instructed to cut alcohol drinking to &lt;/=2 alcoholic drink a day.  His daughter was updated over the phone.

                                                Reported by patients granddaughter.  Patient received second dose of Pfizer vaccine on 3/5/21.  Two days after the second dose, patient began urinating blood.  She reports that the color will change from bright ref to brownish red to darker brown.  She also shared that patient is on Xarelto.  They have been to several doctors and none of them think that the vaccine is the cause, but they wanted to share.  He is having some sort of prostate procedure this week, but she is not sure what it is.

                                                Urinary tract infection; Has been ill; He has been falling a couple times; Had a fracture at the base of his spine; Has gout in one knee; Couldn&#39;t walk; In a lot of pain; his knee swelled up, was very hot,the doctor said it was inflamed; hurt his right knee; he has not been eating; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer (patient&#39;s wife) reported for an 84-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s husband) who received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158) on 10Apr2021 at right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included ongoing high cholesterol diagnosed a long time ago when he was very heavy at one point he was quite heavier than he was. Now he was skin and bones, ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed 10 years ago or longer and ongoing diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago, ongoing pacemaker and ongoing irregular heart beat and falls. The patient previously had sore arms at site after receiving the flu shot for immunization. Ongoing concomitant drugs included Carvedilol for high blood pressure, atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol, amiodarone (this is the medication that would cause an issue with the antibiotic if it was taken orally), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) to thin his blood, sitagliptin phosphate (JANUVIA) for diabetes, vitamin D3, cyanocobalamin (B12), ubidecarenone (CO Q10), sertraline (generic of an old drug called Zoloft) as something to calm him down. The patient was scheduled to get the second vaccine on 01May2021, however he was in the hospital and did not have his. They rescheduled the vaccine for this coming Saturday because he was still in the hospital. He was actually getting moved to a rehabilitation facility with intravenous antibiotics for a urinary tract infection and will not be able to get it. The patient was on an IV antibiotic which could not be administered orally do to the fact he has a pacemaker and irregular heart beat. The doctor told her that the oral medication would interrupt the spikes of the pace maker, his heart.  The reporter was wondering if her husband can still have the COVID vaccine while taking the antibiotic. She asks will it interfere with that medication. Will he have to start all over again with number one of the vaccine because he missed the vaccine in the allotted time span. The last time the patient was weighed he was 155, but he has not been eating since he has been ill. He had so many problems since he has been ill, he has been falling a couple times.  The reporter wanted to protect him from the terrible disease, but didn&#39;t want the injection into his body creating anymore problems than he already has. The doctor said that she thought the caller could take the patient out of the rehab facility for the day and get his vaccine and then bring him back. The facility said they would have to do research about that and get back to her. Caller states that her husband kept falling and had a fracture at the base of his spine, in addition to other problems, he has gout in one knee. She states that he would be standing up talking to her and the next thing she knew he was on the floor. She states that he has fell six times in a month. She states that she has become friends with the fire department because they came out so much. The falling occurred before he got the vaccine. She states he was fine when he went for the first vaccine and then the following week it started all over again, he couldn&#39;t walk. He had a physical therapist helping him strengthen his walking. She states that her husband says he fell and hurt his right knee while working with the physical therapist and the physical therapist said no, no, no, he didn&#39;t fall, he had a strap wrapped around him and the physical therapist caught him before he fell. Caller states that the physical therapist is 30 pounds lighter than her husband and doesn&#39;t know if he could of grabbed him before he hit the floor. She states that her husband was in a lot of pain and his knee swelled up, was very hot. She states that the doctor said it was inflamed. She states that she brought him back to hospital because they could not get him up and he could not walk. She couldn&#39;t pick him up, her son couldn&#39;t pick him up, her daughter couldn&#39;t pick him up and her son and daughter together finally got him up but he couldn&#39;t walk. She states that she called the emergency medical team. They said he has to go to the hospital and that was the last time he was at home. Has a walker and it takes a little while. She didn&#39;t know if he got the gout from that knee, but when they took out his fluid the following day you could of heard him screaming in the next county over. They were suppose to have the results but they didn&#39;t, they discharged him from the hospital. She states that he hasn&#39;t been able to come up with a breather of fresh air and feeling better.  Caller states that he was now taking a gout medication at the hospital and that they told her that her husband had a second fracture to lower spine. The outcome of the events was unknown.

He returned after being evaluated and hospitalized for 6 days Dx included urinary tract infection and acute kidney injury.   We were instructed to report any hospitalizations within 3 days of vaccine.

He became pale, lethargic, diaphoretic, incontinent of urine, and collapsed onto his walker.  A rapid response was called.  Blood pressure on arrival by team  was  50&#39;s/30&#39;s, and fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride 500 mL was initiated while in transit to the ED.  Approximately 20 minutes later the patient&#39;s had stabilized but remained appropriately alert.

Upon arrival home he seemed unusually confused and over the course of the next 15 hrs had bouts of incontinence. He was up 6 times during the night (usually only 1-2x) and unable to get himself out of bed without assistance. Walking continued to be very unsteady. I thought perhaps he had a mini-stroke. I relayed this to his PCP but he didn&#39;t think it was vaccine related

                                                Patient vaccinated with first dose of Pfizer with subsequent infection and hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Initial H&amp;P reads in part as,  &#34;Patients symptoms began on or around Thursday 3/11 when he began to feel  fatigued. After two days of fatigue, he presented to an urgent care facility on  Saturday 3/13. He was noted to have a fever there and was diagnosed with a  presumed UTI, though patient reports at bedside that he has not had any  dysuria. He was treated with nitrofurantoin and increased his furosemide  temporarily per urgent care&#39;s recommendations. He then presented to the ER  on 3/15 with continued fatigue and a low blood pressure at home. We were unable  to clarify the method by which the blood pressure measurement was obtained  and/or if it was repeated. Antibiotics were changed to cephalexin at that time  despite a relatively clear UA. His daughter brought him back to the ER today  (3/18) due to persistent issues with low grade fevers in the 100-100.5 range,  significantly worsening fatigue, anorexia, and oxygen levels of 92-93% on  nonproductive cough. Does not have a home O2 requirement. In addition, he  endorses feeling chilled during the admission evaluation. Denies any chest pain,  nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, constipation. # Fever Progression of symptoms from Saturday 3/13 may constitute original presentation  of Covid-19. Presentations on 3/13 and 3/15 with dyspnea and fatigue. Initially  thought to be UTI and was treated with nitrofurantoin and cephalexin. UA on 3/15  in ED was negative for leuk esterase and nitrites. Tested positive for covid-19  on 3/18 with lymphopenia, 90-92% on room air. No home O2 req. Given duration  of symptoms and worsening fatigue and fevers, will admit for treatment of Covid- 19. Also considered CHF exacerbation, COPD exacerbation as explanations for  dyspnea. Possible CHF exacerbation as well given 1&#43; bilateral pitting edema to  mid-shin and JVD to ear lobe. Suspicion for COPD is low given no report of  increased sputum production and questionable history in chart to begin with.  Would be beneficial to clarify history with collateral history 3/19.&#34;

He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.  He had another episode of lethargy/unresponsiveness on 2/26/2021 and was once again sent to the hospital where they did not show any new findings.  He spent a few days in the hospital before returning to his facility where he continued to have periodic episodes of increased lethargy/confusion and decreased eating.  He was placed on Hospice and passed away on March 29th.

He has also reportedly had a cough and some fever.  There has been some report of incontinence of both bowel and bladder.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 3/17.  He and his wife have returned to the home after wintering in another state.  According to his wife, with whom I have spoken this evening, last night he suddenly became confused.  The confusion continued throughout the day today, thus prompting the EMS called to the house and the subsequent journey to the ED for further evaluation.   In the ER this evening, a battery of testing was completed.  A Covid swab is indeed positive.  His wife is uncertain of any positive contacts.  He had some vascular congestion on chest x-ray.
