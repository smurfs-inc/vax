Patient transferred from Spinal Cord Injury until to ICU on 1/11/2021 due to worsneing dyspnea, hypoxia (80s) and tachycardia and was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure likely 2/2 multifocal pneumonia. CXR findings of &#34;There is interval increase in patchy airspace infiltrates and consolidation in bilateral lungs concerning for pneumonia&#34; Patient was started on vancomycin and pip/tazo on 1/11 and tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained for VAP diagnosis which ultimately grew Serratia liquifaciens and Proteus mirabilis. Infectious Diseases was consulted who recommended a switch to ertapenem therapy for a total 10 day course for VAP. UCx/BCx remained negative. On 1/20, a therapeutic bronchoscopy was completed with cultures growing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and pan-S Klebsiella pneumoniae.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6202 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and stage 4 kidney disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Feb2021 (Saturday), patient was not feeling well and on 28Feb2021, he had diarrhea, chills, shaking all over, severe headache and started throwing up. Reporter stated patient had all the symptoms of the reactions and then &#34;you go again to the serious, more dangerous symptoms, he has all of them&#34;. Throwing up, fever, chills, diarrhea and then he get real hot and then he started sweating and it was another day on 01Mar2021. On Monday (01Mar2021), reporter called to take patient to the hospital with high fever. The ambulance put him on IV and oxygen right away. They gave him fluids and were monitoring everything because he was dehydrated and then he stayed in the hospital for some time. He had x-rays, they monitored his blood pressure and heart rate, and the doctor was concerned about his heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor decided to check his urine and he did and he had a UTI on 01Mar2021, and so he gave him antibiotics for that (treatment unspecified). Patient seemed to be better after having the fluids and everything so they let him come home. During the night on 01Mar2021, he had another attack and it was the same thing that he had before. The shaking and the chills the fever and throwing up and the doctor said that it was a reaction from having the vaccination and reporter just wanted to report that he did and reported actually thought he was going to die. Reporter tried to call again the ambulance since she thought that he was not going to make it. The doctor put on the report and he did not put on there that he was in there because of suspected of (incomplete sentence) and then told the reporter himself that he had a reaction from the vaccine. The report stated that patient was in for a UT, but the reporter stated that, once does not call an ambulance for a UTI and she (reporter), have UTI&#39;s all the time. After the reporter got the patient home, he was even much worse. Patient could not breathe and he was struggling to breathe on 01Mar2021. He was shivering, shaking, having diarrhea, throwing up, soaking wet, and she had to change his clothes twice, and his fever was 103.1 F around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning of 02Mar2021. The pharmacist gave medicine for vomiting. Reporter called the hospital and the nurses were busy and they could not take it so 24 hour nurse called. She was finally able to get him comfortable enough that she didn&#39;t have to call again. She thought she was going lose him. She said she felt twice he was going to die, when she called. At the hospital they told him he was having a severe reaction to the vaccine but also had a UTI and they gave him antibiotics. Patient contacted her nephew who is a medic in the military and RN and he said patient has Covid and thinks reporter has Covid too because the virus was in the vaccine. The nephew explained that patient just could not fight it off and said the vaccine acts like that. It made sense because it is inhibit in it then your body will learn to fight it off, like if you come in contact with it and that makes sense but the woman never explained. The nephew further stated to reported that patient&#39;s immune system or whatever was not able to fight it off. So, he said he has to have Covid and when patient heard that after all they had fought to stay away from it and then what were they supposed to do. Patient got the vaccine and ended up with it and that is what reporter have found out and it was very disturbing. Patient was running a 103.1 earlier on the night of 02Mar2021. He was moaning a little bit on Mar2021. Reporter thought patient had severe allergic reaction to the vaccine because he had all the symptoms and stated there was no doubt in her mind (referring to it being an allergic reaction) as it was too soon after the vaccine. Outcome of the event of dehydration was recovering, while for the remaining events was unknown. Reporter was asking if patient should take the second shot.

He had an MRI on 3/3/2021 that incidentally showed a nonocclusive thrombus in the right dural venous sigmoid sinus, which extends to the right jugular vein. He is being treated with apixaban. It is unclear if this is coincidental or somehow related to the vaccine.

                                                Patient received COVID-19 vaccination on 1/14/2021. On 1/17/2021, patient was transferred to Hospital s/p multiple cardiac arrests. Patient was hyperkalemic and in acute renal failure at time of transfer. Hyperkalemia was treated, but the patient suffered PEA vs VFib. At the time of transfer, patient was on vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. The patient had an EF of 40-45% and elevated troponins.  Patient was made DNR and placed on comfort care. Patient passed away on 1/18/2021. Ultimately we suspect that the patients condition was a direct result of his underlying disease states, but wanted to make sure reporting was made available.

Pt presented to hospital on 04/28 w/ complaints of nausea and vomiting. He stated that he had recently gotten his COVID vaccine. Pt was found to be in acute liver failure in the ED w/ AST and ALT &gt; 1000. Lactate &gt; 15.0. BMP showed AKI on CKD and BG &gt;500. Pt did have cardiac arrest while undergoing CT Scan and ROSC was achieved after CPR x 20 mins.  Pt was hence transferred to the ICU for higher level management and admitted for cardiac arrest and acute liver failure.   Upon arrival, Pt was intubated and sedated. He was non-responsive to verbal and physical stimuli. Pt was acidotic. ABG: 6.99 / 28 / 165 / 7. 1 amp of HCO3 was given upon arrival. Pt was started on insulin gtt for DKA and was started on Levophed for low BP.  Pt underwent cardiac arrest shortly after arrival to the ICU. CPR was performed for &gt; 20 mins without ROSC. Family arrived at bedside and decision was made to stop CPR at 0205 on 04/29/2021.

                                                Patient is a 81 y.o. gentleman with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma, urinary retention for which he self catheterizes twice daily, as well as recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation that presents complaining of increasing weakness and falls.  Patient fell 2/18 pm trying to get out of bed and he took about 20 minutes to get himself to a position where he could pull himself back up.  Again 2/19 he was trying to get up and his legs were too weak to carry him and he fell to the ground.  He needed assistance to get up and family asked him to come to emergency room for evaluation.  He has been feeling poorly for about a month, with poor appetite and has lost about 15 pounds.  He is not nauseated or short of breath and has no cough.  He was apparently treated for UTI about 4 to 6 weeks ago after a visit to urgent care.  He has since been to a different urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was referred to a cardiologist who is planning to do a stress test in a few weeks.  I believe he is on Eliquis now.  In ER he was found to have significant pyuria and bacteriuria and was given a dose of Rocephin.  Renal function shows worsening from levels in December although it is pretty stable over the past month from looking through other labs.

He transiently lost consciousness and then woke up confused and combative.  Brought to emergency room and admitted with multiple rib fractures.  Initial brain imaging was negative but 24 hours later, noted to have small hemorrhagic brain contusion in left frontal/temporal region and a small subdural hematoma.  One day later, there was not noted to be any extension of the hemorrhage/hematoma.

                                                burning when he urinates; sharp pain where his navel is; pain in his stomach; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for himself. An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Parkinson&#39;s disease from an unknown date. The doctor told him to make an appointment with his Parkinson&#39;s doctor and tell him, maybe that has something do with it. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced burning when he urinates for 2 weeks, a sharp pain where his navel is, and pain in his stomach on Jan2021. He was wondering if it could be from the shot or if it is something else. He had an appointment with his doctor on Monday and he told him about it. The doctor gave him an antibiotic, Ciprofloxacin 500 mg that made him dizzy, he does not know if he will continue to take it but it helped the burning, the burning was not as bad. It was in a brown clear pharmacy bottle. The burning when he urinated is going away but the pain in his stomach comes and goes and it is right on his navel, it was described as a real hard pain. Patient would come back 03Feb2021 per vaccination card. Outcome of the event burning when he urinates was recovering while unknown for a sharp pain where his navel is, and pain in his stomach. The events were considered non-serious.

An 83-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265, expiration date: 31Mau2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 13:12 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart surgery (Between 6-9 years before), Congestive heart failure, blood pressure (problems with blood pressure) and fall (history of falls). Concomitant medication included ongoing carvedilol for Congestive heart failure. The reporter stated that her husband has high blood pressure (occurred on an unspecified date) and was having problems falling. He fell the night of 03Feb2021. She called the paramedics to come help get him up. He was taken to the emergency room on the morning of 04Feb2021. He was found to have a urinary tract infection (on 04Feb2021) and was admitted.

                                                Cardiac arrest Narrative:  An 82 year old, male, resident of a facility, received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12/30/20 (time of dose not known). On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name. Breathing was noted to be labored, and nurse was unable to detect a pulse. At 1509, 911 was called and CPR initiated. Spontaneous pulse and breathes resumed just before ambulance arrived at 1522. On arrival at the ED patient was responsive and breathing spontaneously, however, hemodynamically unstable. Patient went into cardiac arrest and code blue called at 1535. Received treatment with epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, amiodarone, atropine. Patient was intubated. EKG obtained and showed acute MI. At 1622 he again went into cardiac arrest and time of death was called.

                                                Patient vaccinated with first dose of Pfizer with subsequent infection and hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Initial H&amp;P reads in part as,  &#34;Patients symptoms began on or around Thursday 3/11 when he began to feel  fatigued. After two days of fatigue, he presented to an urgent care facility on  Saturday 3/13. He was noted to have a fever there and was diagnosed with a  presumed UTI, though patient reports at bedside that he has not had any  dysuria. He was treated with nitrofurantoin and increased his furosemide  temporarily per urgent care&#39;s recommendations. He then presented to the ER  on 3/15 with continued fatigue and a low blood pressure at home. We were unable  to clarify the method by which the blood pressure measurement was obtained  and/or if it was repeated. Antibiotics were changed to cephalexin at that time  despite a relatively clear UA. His daughter brought him back to the ER today  (3/18) due to persistent issues with low grade fevers in the 100-100.5 range,  significantly worsening fatigue, anorexia, and oxygen levels of 92-93% on  nonproductive cough. Does not have a home O2 requirement. In addition, he  endorses feeling chilled during the admission evaluation. Denies any chest pain,  nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, constipation. # Fever Progression of symptoms from Saturday 3/13 may constitute original presentation  of Covid-19. Presentations on 3/13 and 3/15 with dyspnea and fatigue. Initially  thought to be UTI and was treated with nitrofurantoin and cephalexin. UA on 3/15  in ED was negative for leuk esterase and nitrites. Tested positive for covid-19  on 3/18 with lymphopenia, 90-92% on room air. No home O2 req. Given duration  of symptoms and worsening fatigue and fevers, will admit for treatment of Covid- 19. Also considered CHF exacerbation, COPD exacerbation as explanations for  dyspnea. Possible CHF exacerbation as well given 1&#43; bilateral pitting edema to  mid-shin and JVD to ear lobe. Suspicion for COPD is low given no report of  increased sputum production and questionable history in chart to begin with.  Would be beneficial to clarify history with collateral history 3/19.&#34;

He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.  He had another episode of lethargy/unresponsiveness on 2/26/2021 and was once again sent to the hospital where they did not show any new findings.  He spent a few days in the hospital before returning to his facility where he continued to have periodic episodes of increased lethargy/confusion and decreased eating.  He was placed on Hospice and passed away on March 29th.

He has also reportedly had a cough and some fever.  There has been some report of incontinence of both bowel and bladder.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 3/17.  He and his wife have returned to the home after wintering in another state.  According to his wife, with whom I have spoken this evening, last night he suddenly became confused.  The confusion continued throughout the day today, thus prompting the EMS called to the house and the subsequent journey to the ED for further evaluation.
