Pain is central, to the right of the sternum, without radiation. The pain then became more dull, aching, and has been interfering with his sleep. It does seem to be worse when he is thinking about it, better when he is distracted. He went to basketball tryouts 6/15 and the pain has been more frequent since that episode of strenuous exercise. He has not taken anything for the pain. He also notes more frequent fatigue. He denies any prior covid infection. No recent illness or sick contacts. Denies cough, fever, GI upset, diarrhea. He is going to school in-person, they all wear masks.

                                                15 yo male with myocarditis following 2nd dose of pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  He reports that he received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 6/16/21. In the 1-2 days following the vaccine he experienced fatigue, body aches, and fever to Tmax 101F. Family treated this with anti-pyretics. On 6/18 he started having a pain in his left chest. He was again febrile at that time. On the day of admission his chest pain was worse and he was experiencing pain all over his body.   He was noted to be tachycardic in the ED. His initial labs showed a modestly elevated BNP to 593 with a markedly elevated troponin to 1233. CRP was mildly elevated at 3.8. Electrolytes were unremarkable as were LFTs. CBC w/ diff showed an absolute lymphopenia with ALC of 1000 but was otherwise unremarkable. D-Dimer was normal. He was admitted initially to hospital medicine and then was transferred to the ICU due to concern for risk of developing a cardiac arrhythmia. An echocardiogram done showed trace mitral regurgitation but was otherwise normal with normal LV function. CXR was fairly unremarkable. Coags are normal. Repeat electrolytes showed a slight bump in his creatinine. LFTs largely unchaged and procalcitonin of 0.16.    He does have a past medical history of PCR proven COVID-19 disease in December 2020.

Evaluated at local ED, found to have an elevated troponin to 12 and ST elevation in anterolat leads by report  on EKG. An ECHO was obtained and revealed decreased EF to 47% and he was transferred to our hospital,  initially monitored with telemetry, troponin levels every 6 hours and started on scheduled ibuprofen.  Troponin peaked at 22.82 first hospital night on 6/18, then down-trending. Telemetry was without any ectopy. Symptoms improved and hemodynamically stable throughout his PICU course.  Transferred to the pediatric floor on 6/19, continued to do well. Discharged on 6/20 with troponin of 5.92 ng/mL and EF of 55-60% on ECHO.

After two more hours and no change in swelling, gave a second suppository. Immediate small bowel movement. Stomach becoming distended and complaining of increased pain. Took him to the ER. Pain amplified on the way. Admitted to PICU after EKG in ER. Quickly declined and went into respiratory failure. Right lung had no air exchange and left lung collapsed. Myocarditis, pleural effusion, kidney damage and new onset Type I diabetes. Unexplained pneumonia. No growth from fluid in lung.
