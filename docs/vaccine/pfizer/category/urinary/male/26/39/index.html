                                                Given second dose of covid vaccine on friday in the right arm 04/23/2021. The day after the covid vaccine I ran a high fever from about 7:30am until about 9pm on Saturday 04/24/2021.  During Saturday I drank lots of water to combat the fever but I noticed blood in my urine.  The blood got worse through out Saturday into Sunday and I noticed slight pain in my lower back and lower abdomen.  On Sunday morning (04/25/2021) my urine was a dark burgundy color.  This was quite alarming as it was very thick and not as light as the day before.  I drank lots of water on sunday and made sure to watch my urine.  The urine stayed red in color.  I called a telehealth nurse  on Sunday and they suggested I go to Urgent care in the morning.  I woke up on Monday (04/06/2021) with less blood in my urine but still went to urgent care to be safe.  At Urgent care I received a Urine analysis.  The doctor told me there was blood and protein in my urine.  He ruled out a UTI or an STD. The doctor said there may be kidney damage since there is protein present but it cannot be confirmed with the levels. The doctor advised that I continue to drink liquid and watch for worsening signs.  The doctor said I should contact him immediately if the blood or pain gets worse. The doctor also stated I should fill out this VAERS form. Today (04/27/2021) there has been less blood in my urine but there is still some pain in my lower abdomen.  I will contact the doctor at the end of the week to let him know what has happened to my symptoms, he requested I keep him informed.

These symptoms worsened throughout the day. My pulse felt weak. My breathing became rapid and shallow, even though it was not difficult to draw breath. The major symptoms on 6/7 were headache, with a sense of my motion being affected. My urine throughout this time was excessively dark, even though I was drinking more water than normal. The following day, 6/8, most of my joints began to heart, and I became very stiff; this sx lessened after taking a long, slow walk.  On 6/13 another event involving slowed heart rate, subjectively weak pulse, and shortness of breath ensued. There had been no unusual or excessive physical activity, and as I had not experienced this phenomenon before receiving the second vaccine dose on 6/4, I believe that the 6/13 event was also linked to the vaccination.

                                                Sore left arm, muscle soreness, fatigue waking up the next day. Around 24 hrs after vaccination, headache started, and lasted for ~8 hours. I took some advil around an hour before the headache stopped (really wish I&#39;d taken it when I first felt the headache). I could feel the muscle soreness go away before the headache did. The headache felt like it moved from behind my eyes to the back of my head. I decided to only eat bits and pieces of stuff when I was feeling my worst because I was concerned that would make me feel nauseated (never did feel that way, so no idea if that made a difference). I drank probably 200oz of liquid throughout the day, but still felt dehydrated, even though I wasn&#39;t sweating. Did pee a lot though. Generally it was what I expected, but a friend who works at a hospital said I should report the info.

                                                I had the 1st shot on Wednesday March 10th. On Sunday the 14th, just before going to bed at about 11pm, I went to pee. The urine was very dark brown. Didn&#39;t appear to have any red for blood. The next day I felt like water was being retained and it felt that I couldn&#39;t empty the bladder and pee was coming out slower than usual. Late Monday the 15th before bed I peed another dark brown urine and a red blood clot came out. At that point I became very concerned and sent to see the doctor on the 16th. Referred to a kidney specialist for March 31st. Between March 14th to March 29th , somedays I felt like I was retaining water, most days felt like I couldn&#39;t empty my bladder with slow flow. With the recent news of the concerns of blood clots with vaccines, I felt that I should report this.

A 36-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 10Apr2021 (Lot Number: EW0150; Expiration Date: Jul2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.

The patient got his first Pfizer dose for Covid on 10Apr2021 which was on Saturday and after that like another 24 hours after his first dose. He had some blood coming in his urine. It was not too much; it was less but it was there. At least for 24 hours or may be 26 hours. It was 10Apr2021 only. Like he got his vaccine in the afternoon and towards the evening he noticed that. He had beet root also that afternoon like it might and also not sure if that was the thing. But he saw that in the evening and approximately in the night and then next morning it was fine. After that he did not had any issues but he was getting a lot of scratches even if his daughter scratches him he was getting a scratch and that was not getting healed up. It had been like two days he had got a scratch and that was not getting healed up that was they got a little worried. No treatment was received for events.

No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.
