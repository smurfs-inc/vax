                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

                                                By nightfall on the day of my second dose, I was extremely jaundiced. The following morning, my urine was darker than it has ever been - a dark amber/brown color. These are symptoms that I do experience routinely as someone with CAD. Hemolysis causes these same symptoms, but it seems the vaccine accelerated the hemolysis for some reason. Perhaps it activated complement. Regardless, this event did not last beyond the weekend, and has not been an issue since. I just thought it should be recorded as an adverse event.

A 63-years-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 21Dec2020 14:40, at a single dose for Covid 19. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient has no prior vaccinations -within 4 weeks. The patient is an EEG technician. On 22Dec2020, the patient reported the next day he started to feel sluggish, chills, tired/fatigue, pain all over his body, patient mentioned he has lost weight everyday since he got the shot from 153 pounds to 142 pounds; then on Wednesday evening 23Dec2020, it was a nightmare, he got sweating; fever with a high of 101.4 Fahrenheit; he was running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; and he was so tired and fatigued. Added when he was getting up all that night he was having night sweats up to five times a night and chills; and his heart was pounding. The urination, heart pounding resolved the next day. All of these events have improved at the time of report (now) or gone away but he is still sweating once at night for the last two days and he is tired and fatigued. He stated that he is scheduled for the second dose on 11Jan2021 and he is concerned if he should take the vaccine. He mentioned that he was tested for COVID 19 on 18Dec2020 and the result was inconclusive. He went again 23Dec2020 they called him on 25Dec2020 and informed he was positive per the PCR test. He treated himself with 500mg acetaminophen (UPC 0904672059; lot OBE2896 and expiration Oct2021) and azithromycin Z-Pack (NDC 65862-641-69; Lot ZYSA20012-A; and expiration date Mar2022). The sample of the product is not available to be returned. Predisposing factor was that the patient&#39;s wife was at home and was sick too at the same time. She was tested Sunday with no results yet. The outcome of the events of fever recovered on 28Dec2020, sluggishness recovered on 29Dec2020, pain all over the body was recovered on 02Jan2021; running to the bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine and heart pounding were recovered on 24Dec2020, weight loss was not recovered, and for other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (4 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between event &#34;COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / SARS-CoV-2 test positive) and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded

                                                urinating blood; might be a UTI; arm pain; fatigue; blood clots; he started bleeding after the first shot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. This 63-year-old male patient reported that he received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EL3249) on 18Feb2021 (also reported as 17Feb2021) (at the age of 63-years-old) via an unspecified route as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included enlarged prostate, urinary health issues (gets up in the middle of the night), and has glasses as he had cataract surgery last year (2020) so he lost his close-up vision. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 18Feb2021, the patient got his first shot. Three weeks later, he had an episode of urinating blood and blood clots profusely. The patient stated the amount of blood and blood clots was scary at best. The patient reached out to his daughter who is a nurse who advised him to go to the Emergency Room (ER). He reached out to the nurse hotline as well, which recommended that he go to the emergency room that day as well. He went to the ER (it was a Sunday). They did a blood test, a sonogram or some kind of sonogram, and a urine sample. They also flushed the patient&#39;s bladder out with a catheter. This emergency room visit determined that it might be a urinary tract infection (UTI) and started him on antibiotics. The patient confirmed he was not admitted to the hospital. The patient then made an appointment with his doctor because that was on a weekend. He saw his doctor who referred him to a urologist. The patient also reported that he did have the normal arm pain and fatigue the second day or the day after the shot. The patient reported 11Mar2021 or 12Mar2021 was when he started bleeding after the first shot, he was unsure of the exact date, and stated he went to the hospital on 14Mar2021. The patient reported he is going to the doctor today (21Apr2021), to see the urologist but the urologist is going to do a scope in his bladder because that is the only thing that they cannot see. The clinical outcome of events urinating blood, blood clots, UTI, bleeding, arm pain, and fatigue was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) :PFIZER INC-2021471072 same patient/reporter, different AE/2nd dose

                                                12/21/2020 I had my first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and the second on 1/13/2021. Two days after my second vaccine on 1/15/2021 at 8:50 PM I had a scintillating scotoma in my right visual field in both eyes consisting of a bright flash of light in the center of my visual field that cleared but then it expanded into a C-shaped series of zig-zag lines that slowly expanded into the periphery of both right visual fields. It ended at 9:20 PM. I had no headaches afterward. While I have had migraines when I was younger, I haven?t had one in several decades and I never had an aura before it.   I went to the ED where I was evaluated for a possible TIA and then admitted into Hospital. While there my platelet count was 400% of what it usually was.  Other than the platelet count and anemia (I donated 2 unit of packed red blood cells on 12/17/2020) the rest of my blood work was unrevealing.   The scintilating scotoma only lasted 30 minutes but the elevated platelets (although slowly coming down) continues to this day.

No proteins in the urine. I dip sticked my urine in the office this Monday (18th) or Tuesday - no blood - negative. I think it&#39;s resolved now.

Within hours of taking the first dose I had an extremely bad reaction to the antibiotic. I can&#39;t describe the feeling because it was unlike any I have ever had. But I felt the worst I have ever felt in my life. The reaction was intense for 36 hours. It was so bad I could not even sit up.  The reaction was not so dramatic after 36 hours but I was still feeling miserable until I quit taking the drug. Then I felt fine.

A 69-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood clots (reported as blood thinner). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 2019 and ongoing as blood thinner. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Feb2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization which gave him severe diarrhea, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, a sore arm and it wore him out. After the second dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 which was administered in a public health department, the patient experienced sore arm. He was concerned because around 02:00 on 19Mar2021, he got up to go to the bathroom and noticed his left leg was basically numb and rubbery.  As soon as he tried to stand up, he fell. He thought the second vaccine was the one everyone says will be harder than the first. They even gave him a sheet of paper that scared the hell out of him. Thought he was okay after the second vaccine until around 02:00. At first, he thought his leg had just gone to sleep. It was like having noodles for legs. The patient has been urinating almost non-stop which also started around 02:00, this was what woke him up. He had to crawl on hands and knees after falling to get into the bathroom, he had no strength except a smidgen of strength in the right leg. On 18Mar2021, while eating dinner, he had trouble holding his fork and did not think much about it. He had a cramp feeling in right hand. Today, while eating lunch with a fork, he also had a difficulty. The patient eats with his right hand. The patient has been trying to learn how to walk since early this morning. He has worn out his wife since she was cleaning up after him in the bathroom and helping him walk. He couldn&#39;t walk to the commode very well, couldn&#39;t hold his water, and has been making a mess all day. He was at first afraid he was having a stroke but had no stroke symptoms. The patient reported that his weight was 201, then mentioned that during the night he thought about how much he was urinating and got on the scale out of curiosity and it said he weighs 191. At this time, his leg weakness persists but he was able to stand and hold his own body weight. Issue with holding fork and cramp feeling in right hand was persisting. Urinating was persisting and stated he was going about every 2 hours and goes a lot. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 17Mar2021; unknown for stroke, fall, and weight loss; and not recovered for all other events.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3302), intramuscular on 22Jan2021 15:10 at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml by intramuscular injection left shoulder) for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (diagnosed about 21 years ago), ongoing gout (Diagnosed about 2 years ag), ongoing ankle spur right foot, ongoing diminished cartilage both knees, joint pain. The concomitant medications included torsemide. The patient reported adverse event (AE) after his first Pfizer-Biontech covid19 vaccine at 15:10  on 22Jan2021. He reported arm pain starting 3 hours after vaccination until noon the next day (23Jan2021). When he woke up on 23Jan2021 he reported lower back pain, that has migrated more to the right hip and into the glute. The pain inhibits walking, standing, etc. He did note that he is &gt;300lbs and has had joint pain in the past, but the hip pain is new. He also thought it might be kidney pain, as he takes a daily diuretic. He stated he has been treating with Aleve twice a day, but that walking is still very bad.  The patient is an optometrist that was calling about the Covid-19 vaccine and said that he did not know if the Lot number written on the vaccination card is EL3302, E13302, or EI3302. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and reported that he got a sore arm about 3 hours after receiving the injection. He woke up with a sore lower back pain. He is 5ft 9.5 and 310 lbs and he is on Torsemide, a pretty strong diuretic. He woke up with the back pain and stated that it moved right and middle to his buttocks, a little lower than the end of his spine and to the right. He did not think it was his kidneys. He said that Torsemide can make kidneys work overtime. His knees were pretty shot, the left worse than the right. No further details provided. He was upset to know that he has shrunk a 1.5 inches over the years. He has been taking 2 Aleve a day since Saturday, this morning was his 4th pill. He said that it is really odd when he stands equally on both feet his lower back hurts. He has to sleep on his right side and that it hurts more when he sleeps on his back and on his left side. He was fearful doing eye exams next to his patient and how the lower back pain would affect him.  Reporter considered seriousness for Lower back pain was Medically significant. The outcome of event lower back pain was not recovered; of event arm pain was recovered on 23Jan2021; of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event low back pain cannot be excluded. The ongoing gout and concomitant drug torsemide may also play contributory roles to the event.

He received a second dose of COVID vaccine yesterday about midday.  Shortly thereafter, he started having shivers and shakes.  The concern that I had when he called the office was a possible bacteremia.  He was sensitive emergency room for evaluation.  He was noting that he was chilled and was unable to get warm. He said his temperature was up to 100.5.  He had generalized weakness and inability to get up and walk and had malaise.  He has no known exposures to pneumonia or other illnesses.  He has basically been homebound for the past year with the COVID.  He was evaluated in the emergency room and found to have an elevated white blood cell count on the right upper lobe pneumonia on portable chest x-ray.  Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained since he had a urine abnormality as well.  The patient was admitted to observation while we wait on cultures and we treat the pneumonia with antibiotics.

                                                Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus; Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; COVID-19 confirmed by positive COVID-19 test / COVID pneumonia; blood clot; blood pressure was low; Respiratory arrest; Respiratory failure; Hypoxemia; ventricular tachycardia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting on behalf of the husband. A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient and his wife went to the local senior citizen center on 12Jan2021 to get the vaccine. After which the patient noticed a slight dizziness on 12Jan2021 which was minimal, and the dizziness was something that was normal for him. The dizziness started within 15 minutes time frame after receiving the vaccine. The dizziness occurred when he stood up to leave on 12Jan2021; now the dizziness has recovered. He stated he had dizziness and it went away and possibly occurred because he got up too quick. He also felt a little woozy on 12Jan2021 and it was under control.

With these, his primary care provider was very much concerned, and he had a battery of tests done then he was discovered to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) on 22Jan2021. He informed that his primary care provider asked him to go into the office since the primary care provider was convinced that it was something more than just a reaction to the Pfizer covid vaccine. He had more tests on 22Jan2021 and that was when he was diagnosed with a UTI. It was a minimal UTI, not of any consequence, that when the doctor pushed on his bladder it hurt on 22Jan2021.

                                                The morning after receiving second dose, I awoke with a headache, no strength at all and  no bladder control.  It took me forty five minutes to get out of bed after numerous attempts.  I also experience dizziness, balance issues.  In all honesty, it was as if I had gotten Covid all over again.  I had it in late August and all of September.  The second day after the shot, I experienced lack of strength, but not as bad as the first day, and whole body muscle aches.  The third day after,  was about the same and after that, things started getting a  little better.

Had to go to bed sitting up with three pillows on my back. The next morning went to doctor who ordered blood test and chest X-Ray. Chest X-Ray indicated Pulmonary Embolism. Doctor started me on Eliquis blood thinner to hopefully desolve the blood clot on my lung. Doctor suggested I report Pulmonary Embolism occuring same day as my first vaccine shot. Do not know if shot caused Pulmonary Embolism or just a coinsidence. In addition doctor found blood in my urine and a CT of Bladder has been ordered

He was off pressors but remained intubated due to poor mental status with unclear etiology. It could be related to liver failure, vs neurological insult vs renal failure. Head CT 4 days prior on the 2/24 were without acute intracranial pathology. Hepatology was consulted and did not believe the liver was the main etiology behind poor mental status. Patient progressively declined with continuously increased IV pressor requirement. ABG showed worsening lactate acidosis and was anuric. Patient&#39;s family was notified of decline and agreed for the patient to be transition to comfort care early 2/28. Bedside RN notified pronouncing physician of cessation of respiration and cardiac activity.
