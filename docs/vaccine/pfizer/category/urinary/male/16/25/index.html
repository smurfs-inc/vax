Around 8:40pm he came to me after using the bathroom and discovered blood in urine. He wiped himself and their was red blood on the toilet paper. He used the bathroom again around 10:00pm and saw red blood in the toilet as well as on the toilet paper when he wiped himself. He also experienced stinging pain when urinating both times.

                                                presented to outside ED with complaints of new onset chest pain that radiated to the back and down his arms with concurrent nausea. Patient was sitting in the living room around 2030-2045 when he developed midsternal and epigastric region pain. Pain radiated to his upper middle back and down both left and right arms. There were no notable exacerbating or relieving factors. Pain was a 4-7 in severity. He was also nauseated. He was given tums by his mother without significant change in symptoms. After 45 minutes they decided to go to the ER. At ER labs were notable for elevated troponin (2-- &gt;15-- &gt;9). EKG with J-point elevation. Non-contrast CT chest/abd/pelvis was unremarkable. He was given ASA 325 and famotidine in the ED. Pain eventually subsided around 2345. He was transferred to another hospital for further evaluation of troponinemia.

The following day (4/29/2021) patient was on a boat, in the sun, not drinking much water and noticed brown discoloration of urine. He drank more fluids and symptoms resolved. Patient received second COVID vaccine on 5/19/2021 and the following day (5/20/2021) he was again on a boat and in the sun all day long and noticed brown discoloration of his urine which resolved with increasing his fluid intake. On 6/2/2021, he noticed brown discoloration again that progressed to bright red blood in urine. Patient was seen in my clinic and labs showed acute kidney injury, hematuria, proteinuria, possible glomerulonephritis and/or acute tubular necrosis. He is being followed closely by Pediatric Nephrology now to monitor symptoms and will repeat labs to see if kidney function, hematuria, proteinuria has resolved. If it has not resolved, then he may need a renal biopsy to confirm diagnosis.

Pt states he has had 1 day of sudden onset L shoulder pain and chest pain. Endorses dyspnea due to pain with deep breaths, denies tachypnea, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. Endorses mild chills and aches after COVID vaccine 3 days prior to onset of symptoms, denies any fever, URI symptoms, diarrhea, rash, known COVID contacts. Pain continued to worsen and spread across his chest, causing presentation to ED this afternoon. No history of PE, DVT, long travel, recent surgery, malignancy, alcohol or cocaine use. Significant cardiac history in family: dad with CAD w/LAD blockage, both parents with hypertension.    At ED, labs notable for elevated troponin 0.456, repeat 0.67 and diffuse ST elevations on EKG concerning for pericarditis. COVID neg, CXR unremarkable, blood cx drawn, no abx started. Patient was given toradol for pain with minimal improvement. Peds cardiology was consulted and patient was transferred to different ED for further care.   At different ED, repeat EKG showed similar diffuse ST elevations in I, II, aVL. Repeat troponins uptrending (4.91), proBNP 562, ESR 43, CRP 18. Mildly tachycardic but otherwise hemodynamically stable. Given tylenol for pain. Cardiology recommended admission for trending troponins, echo and cardiac monitoring.  CV: Troponins were trended every 12 hours with a max of 4.91.  His last troponin checked on the morning of discharge was 0.41.  He had an echo that showed normal cardiac function, an MRI that indicated normal ventricular size and function, with minimal or healing and inflammation or mild myocarditis.  During his admission, he had continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, that did not show any arrhythmias.   Resp: On 2L NC for comfort, no respiratory distress or hypoxia.   FENGI: Regular diet   Neuro: Ibuprofen scheduled and tylenol PRN for pain.  He was initially started on ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, but was starting to have pain prior to being due for medicine every 8 hours so his regimen was changed to 600 mg every 6 hours which controlled his pain adequately.   ID: Myocarditis panel sent with some results still pending.  Thus far, he is CMV negative, EBV IgG was positive but not IgM.  RVP was negative.  This all occurred in the setting receiving the Covid vaccine 3 days prior to presentation, which has been reported as a rare reaction to the Covid vaccine.  At the time of discharge, labs pending results include mycoplasma pneumonia, coxsackie, parvovirus, enterovirus. Etiology of myocarditis remains unclear at this time, could be related to infectious etiology not yet clear to us, vs related to his COVID vaccine prior to admission.

Immediately fooling the administration of the vaccine patients eyes glazed over and he fainted.  A few seconds later he began to have a spastic seizure that was short in nature, followed by a voiding of his bladder before he regained consciousness.  Patient was given water, glucose tablets, and instructed to lay on the floor of the room with his feet elevated while a member of the staff stayed with him to treat and watch him.   Followed up with patient and doctor soon after to learn this was the only time it has happened, patient fully recovered.

Studies largely negative for an identifiable bacterial process so presumptive diagnosis is aseptic meningitis. Unclear if from vaccine or other etiologies. Outside hospital had started antibiotics but this was stopped and patient symptomatically recovered with only symptomatic care.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

A 20-year-old male patient first dose of received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), intramuscular, administered in left arm on 19Apr2021, at the age of 20-years old, (Lot Number: EW0151) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19. It was reported that the patient was in his usual state of good health until 19Apr2021, when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. On 20Apr2021, he woke up the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. On21Apr2021, he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the Emergency department. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have worsening renal failure, follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. The patient&#39;s unilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. His kidney function continued to decline and hemodialysis was begun on 27Apr2021. His kidney function continued to decline on hemodialysis, becoming so he was transferred to the MICU for CRRT.
