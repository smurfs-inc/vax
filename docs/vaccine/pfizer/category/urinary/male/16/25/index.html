Around 8:40pm he came to me after using the bathroom and discovered blood in urine. He wiped himself and their was red blood on the toilet paper. He used the bathroom again around 10:00pm and saw red blood in the toilet as well as on the toilet paper when he wiped himself. He also experienced stinging pain when urinating both times.

Patient was sitting in the living room around 2030-2045 when he developed midsternal and epigastric region pain. Pain radiated to his upper middle back and down both left and right arms. There were no notable exacerbating or relieving factors. Pain was a 4-7 in severity. He was also nauseated. He was given tums by his mother without significant change in symptoms. After 45 minutes they decided to go to the ER. At ER labs were notable for elevated troponin (2-- &gt;15-- &gt;9). EKG with J-point elevation. Non-contrast CT chest/abd/pelvis was unremarkable. He was given ASA 325 and famotidine in the ED. Pain eventually subsided around 2345. He was transferred to another hospital for further evaluation of troponinemia.

The following day (4/29/2021) patient was on a boat, in the sun, not drinking much water and noticed brown discoloration of urine. He drank more fluids and symptoms resolved. Patient received second COVID vaccine on 5/19/2021 and the following day (5/20/2021) he was again on a boat and in the sun all day long and noticed brown discoloration of his urine which resolved with increasing his fluid intake. On 6/2/2021, he noticed brown discoloration again that progressed to bright red blood in urine. Patient was seen in my clinic and labs showed acute kidney injury, hematuria, proteinuria, possible glomerulonephritis and/or acute tubular necrosis. He is being followed closely by Pediatric Nephrology now to monitor symptoms and will repeat labs to see if kidney function, hematuria, proteinuria has resolved. If it has not resolved, then he may need a renal biopsy to confirm diagnosis.

                                                16 year old male with no PMH who presented with chest pain. Initially on 6/10-6/11 had expected myalgias and headaches post vaccination similar to dose #1, but later 6/11 developed chest pain that made it impossible for him to sleep. It was waxing and waning but continued through 6/12 which after discussion with PMD ultimately led to referral into our facility for further evaluation. Received a dose of ibuprofen with marked symptomatic relief. No further medications given during his time, his chest pain had resolved after that ibuprofen dose and was at clinical baseline until discharge on 6/15. Prolonged hospital course was to arrange for cardiac MRI to be done for comparison. Otherwise had serial labs (documented below) which had trended in the right direction.

                                                After my son received his 2nd Dose of the Pfizer on the scheduled date at approx.10:45 am, we went home and were just relaxing and at approx 1:54 pm.  My son in a panic yelled for me to come into the bathroom and he showed me his urine and it was bright red with clots (Gross Hematuria).  I know the time because as soon as I saw it I took a picture (of which I still have on my phone).  I proceeded to access how he was feeling and after he said he felt okay just scared-no pain or anything, I called his Pediatrician whose office instructed me to take him to the ER and that is what I did.  He was not rough housing, there was no trauma  and again no pain.  This has never happened before.

Pt states he has had 1 day of sudden onset L shoulder pain and chest pain. Endorses dyspnea due to pain with deep breaths, denies tachypnea, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. Endorses mild chills and aches after COVID vaccine 3 days prior to onset of symptoms, denies any fever, URI symptoms, diarrhea, rash, known COVID contacts. Pain continued to worsen and spread across his chest, causing presentation to ED this afternoon. No history of PE, DVT, long travel, recent surgery, malignancy, alcohol or cocaine use. Significant cardiac history in family: dad with CAD w/LAD blockage, both parents with hypertension.    At ED, labs notable for elevated troponin 0.456, repeat 0.67 and diffuse ST elevations on EKG concerning for pericarditis. COVID neg, CXR unremarkable, blood cx drawn, no abx started. Patient was given toradol for pain with minimal improvement. Peds cardiology was consulted and patient was transferred to different ED for further care.   At different ED, repeat EKG showed similar diffuse ST elevations in I, II, aVL. Repeat troponins uptrending (4.91), proBNP 562, ESR 43, CRP 18. Mildly tachycardic but otherwise hemodynamically stable. Given tylenol for pain. Cardiology recommended admission for trending troponins, echo and cardiac monitoring.  CV: Troponins were trended every 12 hours with a max of 4.91.  His last troponin checked on the morning of discharge was 0.41.  He had an echo that showed normal cardiac function, an MRI that indicated normal ventricular size and function, with minimal or healing and inflammation or mild myocarditis.  During his admission, he had continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, that did not show any arrhythmias.   Resp: On 2L NC for comfort, no respiratory distress or hypoxia.   FENGI: Regular diet   Neuro: Ibuprofen scheduled and tylenol PRN for pain.  He was initially started on ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, but was starting to have pain prior to being due for medicine every 8 hours so his regimen was changed to 600 mg every 6 hours which controlled his pain adequately.   ID: Myocarditis panel sent with some results still pending.  Thus far, he is CMV negative, EBV IgG was positive but not IgM.  RVP was negative.  This all occurred in the setting receiving the Covid vaccine 3 days prior to presentation, which has been reported as a rare reaction to the Covid vaccine.  At the time of discharge, labs pending results include mycoplasma pneumonia, coxsackie, parvovirus, enterovirus. Etiology of myocarditis remains unclear at this time, could be related to infectious etiology not yet clear to us, vs related to his COVID vaccine prior to admission.

Immediately fooling the administration of the vaccine patients eyes glazed over and he fainted.  A few seconds later he began to have a spastic seizure that was short in nature, followed by a voiding of his bladder before he regained consciousness.  Patient was given water, glucose tablets, and instructed to lay on the floor of the room with his feet elevated while a member of the staff stayed with him to treat and watch him.   Followed up with patient and doctor soon after to learn this was the only time it has happened, patient fully recovered.

Initial symptoms presented with rhinorrhea, then severee headache, neck pain, and fever (tactile). Had sweats and chills. Began to experience diarrhea, dysuria, diffue body aches and myalgias. Severe pain in his neck / posterior occiput. Denied any mental status changes at the time.   Studies largely negative for an identifiable bacterial process so presumptive diagnosis is aseptic meningitis. Unclear if from vaccine or other etiologies. Outside hospital had started antibiotics but this was stopped and patient symptomatically recovered with only symptomatic care.

A 17-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 at the age of 17-years-old intramuscular on Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was none.  The patient received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced admitted w/ hematuria found to have IgA nephropathy confirmed on kidney biopsy in Apr2021. History suggestive of symptom correlation with pfizer covid 19 vaccine doses. Pt first noted 1-2d hematuria immediatly after first dose. Sx resumed few days after second dose.  The patient was hospitalized for admitted w/ hematuria found to have IgA nephropathy confirmed on kidney biopsy for 5 days.  The adverse event result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome was recovering.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Limited information regarding patient medical history , any concurrent medical conditions ,family history of nephropathy ,clinical course of events and concomitant medications preclude a comprehensive causality assessment of event IgA Nephropathy and Hematuria post- vaccination.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

In brief, 20-year-old neurologically normal man with history of asthma now presenting with new onset fever, headache and then status epilepticus. On 5/25 the patient received his second dose of COVID vaccine and then started to have intermittent fevers up to 102.5.  This was associated with malaise, nausea, fever, headache, myalgias.  He came to ED on 5/30 and had IVF, analgesics and a cardiac workup that was unremarkable and was discharged with diagnosis of possible pericarditis/myocarditis.  He then had ongoing worsening headaches and increasing fevers and was unable to get out of his bed, and so his wife called 911 and he came to ED on 6/3.  There he had vomiting and transaminitis and was diagnosed with gastroenteritis treated with flagyl. Headaches progressed and were associated with dizziness; he had HCT read as unremarkable but then while awaiting MRI had convulsion.  He was returned to his room and had two more and thus was intubated, placed on propofol/versed, Keppra, dilantin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir before transfer to UCSF. on 6/5/2021 found to have reduced urine output, and serum creatinine found to be 1.72 and climbed &gt;7 in days later normalized spontaneously with fluid support to 4.26 with continued improvement.  LFTs were also found to be elevated.  Was acutely encephalopathic. Seizures resolved on Keppra treatment though had acute agitation for several days. Slowly returning to neurologic baseline. with AKI and LFTs slowly normalizing.

That persisted for the next two days. I went to an  Urgent Care  - this time.  They did Urinalysis - confirmed  blood in my urine; also leukocytes were high - they gave me course of antibiotics and it resolved that same day but I continued the seven day course of antibiotics - Bactrim. I thought it might be kidney stones but I never saw anything come out and it seemed to resolve pretty quickly. Yet it almost seemed resolved before I really started taking the antibiotics.  They also gave me an ultrasound of my kidneys at the Urgent Care.
