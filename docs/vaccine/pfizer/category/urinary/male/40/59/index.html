I gave him his immunization quickly and he did well.  He stood up and watched as I immunized his wife.  He said he was feeling okay afterwards so both him and his wife left the immunization room.  Shortly after leaving he must have started getting dizzy, because next thing I hear is that there is an unconscious man in the waiting room.  He is sitting in a chair with his head back unresponsive.  His wife if rubbing his arms and lightly slapping his face.  He comes to, and we decide to move him to the room that the clinic uses (we have a walk in clinic staffed with a NP).  He lays on the floor, and within a minute he proceds to vomit approximately 4 times.  He also lost control of his bladder.  He was pale with cold and clammy skin.  we moved him so we could put his feet up on a chair and allowed him to rest.  Someone went to get him an ice pack to put on his head and chest.  His blood pressure was low (90/50ish).   He still was not feeling better after 30 minutes so we called the ambulance.  He did not want to go to the hospital so the paramedics monitored him.  his blood pressure slowly started going up and normalizing, and he left with his wife.

                                                Abdominal pain; Diagnosed with Acute Kidney Failure; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, reporting for himself.  A 42-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 13Apr2021 at 10:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma (diagnosed when he was serving around the year 1999-2000). Concomitant medications included albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]) taken for asthma. In Apr2021, the patient was diagnosed with acute kidney failure, which required physician office visit and emergency room visit. On 14Apr2021, the patient experienced abdominal pain, which required physician office visit and emergency room visit. As reported, he took the vaccine about 3 weeks ago and immediately the next day he had abdominal pain. The patient reported that he stopped everything when he experienced the pain. The pain started mild and then increased and he went to the emergency room. The patient wasn&#39;t admitted to the hospital but after they checked his blood and urine with unknown results, he was given an IV.  When he was released he was told to follow up the next week with his primary care provider. The pain still had not gone away and was in the right side of his abdomen. The pain changed day by day. He had been drinking a lot of water and had maybe 1-2 days where the pain was worse than normal. He had been in and out of the doctor&#39;s office and his kidney levels are a little bit high on an unknown date. Every 2 weeks, blood and urine tests were taken to measure his kidney levels to see how it is doing. CAT scan was performed and did not see anything. The patient reported that something was observed in blood and urine and that&#39;s how an issue with his kidneys was determined. The clinical outcome of the events was not recovered.   The batch/lot number for the vaccine, btn162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Medical history included Hair loss. Concomitant medication included finasteride 2.5 mg, daily for Hair loss. The patient stated, &#34;So, I got the COVID 19 Vaccine on Tuesday, and I had no fever or anything like that. It was the first shot I got it into the deltoid and today (25De2020), I noticed my urine is dark red, I mean like dark orange. I didn&#39;t know if it&#39;s a common side effect or not?&#34; Physician stated, &#34;I never had it before, it&#39;s very unusual. When asked for treatment, physician stated, &#34;No, I didn&#39;t. Just water.&#34;. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

He was started on empiric antibiotics for possible CNS infection, lumbar puncture completed. Found to have acellular CSF and antibiotics were discontinued.

The patient states that about a month and a half his neurologist did increase his Requip up from 0.5 mg 3 times a day to 1.5 mg 3 times per day.  However, it has never made him nauseous before.  He denies any definite chest pain.  He denies any exertional dyspnea.  He does admit that his blood pressure has been fluctuating for quite some time.

His blood pressure was very elevated in the systolic 170 range and he did require some IV labetalol.  The patient states he really has not missed any doses of his medications.

A 51-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 29May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: FW0187) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history and concomitant medication were reported. The patient experienced the following symptoms: weakness on 29May2021, pain around the kidney on 29May2021, muscle pain in his back in 2021, sweating on 29May2021, shaking on 29May2021, rash around the body on 30May2021/rash all around body was reported as worsened and sore throat on 30May2021/sore throat was reported as worsened, a little scared in 2021, pain around back on 29May2021. Clinical course: A couple hours after the first vaccination, he started to feel weakness and pain around his kidney and back part. Also, some symptoms that are very common. He felt sweating and shaking and stuff like that. That night he noticed he started to have a rash all around his body and day by day it has been getting worse. On 01Jun2021, he went to the hospital emergency room and they gave him some medicine. He received a shot of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) in the hospital. They also gave him an IV to flush out his body. Then the doctor gave him three prescriptions. He was released from the emergency room yesterday as well. 1. Aluminium hydroxide gel, dried, magnesium carbonate (PEPCID) 20 mg Expiration- Nov2022 in a pharmacy bottle, No lot number; 2. diphenhydramine hydrochloride (generic one) 25mg Expiration- Nov2023 in a pharmacy bottle, no Lot number; 3. Methylprednisolone tablet 4mg (NDC: 68001-005-01; Lot number: 20P0432, Brand: Bluepoint). Dose details: 6 days- First day to take 6 together, second day to take 5 together, fourth day to take 4 and so on for 6 days. So far, he has just taken the first dose which is 6 together. When he woke up today, he noticed that his rash was even worse. He didn&#39;t know how far the rash will go. The rash was like a burn and watery. The rash was all around his body. It started on his head; under his head and all around his face, then stomach, back and legs. His primary doctor and the emergency doctor suggested for him to not get the second dose because the second dose of BNT162B2 was going to have a stronger reaction. Some event details described as follows: weakness: Experienced 5 hours after receiving the shot. Considering how it has worsened his daily activities, from zero to 10, was like a 4. Pain around kidney: Like a muscle pain around kidneys that started about 8-10 hours after the shot. That pain came and went. It&#39;s not that much pain but still with him. Zero to 10 is like a 4 or 5 on pain level. Pain around back: pain was like a muscle pain. He experienced this 10 hour after vaccine. The pain has sort of improved. It was almost resolved. Sweating: He experienced on first night. 12 hours after. It came and went, but still ongoing. It was not that much, but still he still had it. Shaking: He experienced this on same night as the sweating. 12 hours after. It was almost recovered. It has happened one or two times over the past two days. Rash all around body: He noticed this a day after his shot. It was a couple of them around his body. It started from his head and spread all around body, but it was not that much at first. Day by day it has been getting worse and today is the worst day so far. The emergency room doctor checked his kidneys just in case. They told him everything was fine with the kidneys. It seems like it is a problem with the muscle. Also, he had a sore throat. It started 3 days ago. When he drinks or eat something, he felt burning. He noticed it the first time at nighttime. The emergency room doctor is assuming he had a vaccine reaction. Reporter seriousness for events weakness, pain around kidney, pain around back, sweating, shaking, rash all around body and sore throat was provided as unspecified. The outcome of event muscle pain in his back and a little scared was unknown; of event shaking and pain around back was recovering; of rest events was not recovered.

                                                On May 21st @ 10:25am, I received my 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute &#34;holding period&#34;, but the following morning, May 22nd @ ~09:00am, I was urinating blood and blood clots with very little urine evacuating.  Proceeded to the Urgent Care facility to which they immediately directed me to the ER.  Upon arrival, they had me give a urine sample which was blood red, and put me on a picc line and pushed fluids, then performed a CT and an ultrasound of my pelvic area.  During this time, my urge to urinate began to become very painful because my bladder was now fully blocked and I could only pass a small amount of blood clots.  They then had to install a large 3 way catheter to relieve the urine and allow the passing of the large blood clots coming from my hemorrhaging left kidney.  After being in the ER for ~8.5 hours, they released me with the catheter still installed with a mobile bag.  I stayed laid up for 2.5 days until Monday when all of the blood clots had passed and my urine had returned to a normal color.  They then removed the catheter and sent me on with medication to continue to take.  I have a follow up appointment, but I am still having restrictions when I urinate and now when I try to ejaculate, so I am very concerned that this has permanently injured me.  I have had ZERO issues in the past and consider myself a very healthy individual who works very hard to stay healthy.  I maintain a weight of 206-210 lbs @ 6&#39;1&#34; through a daily rigorous exercise program, diet, and supplements.  I don&#39;t smoke, do drugs, or drink excessively.   This event has cost me money for my deductible (because I don&#39;t use it), plus the costs of the copays, medications, and 1 day of missed work.  I have all of the paperwork from both the ER visit and Urology visits... Please advise what I can do to recoup my out of pocket costs for a vaccine that the Government has directed the population to receive.  You can reach me at this email.  Thank you.

A 53-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 01May2021 (Lot Number: EW0161; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunization (keep him alive and healthy). Medical history included ongoing sugar (diabetes) that was diagnosed with sugar 15 years ago (2005), heavy (overweight) been heavy for years. (biggest at 250 and is down to 236-238 now. It was stated that he lost weight before the shot and they do not know why), ongoing seizure all his life (he has had seizures all life), cholesterol (blood cholesterol abnormal), son that is special needs and high functioning and on vagus nerve apparatus. The patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE) via unknown site on 10Apr2021 (Lot number: EW0158) for Covid-19 immunization. Concomitant medication included unspecified medications for seizures and has a VMS (unspecified). The reporter stated that has a son that is special needs and high functioning. The father stated that he has had seizures all life, so he wanted to know if the shot cause him to have more seizures. The father mentioned that he is having seizures back to back to back and wetting himself. The father does not think this has anything to do with the shot, but his mom does. The reporter mentioned that the patient&#39;s mom looked online and saw something that stated it causes seizures. The reporter inquired if there were any reports of having seizures for special needs or anybody. He added that the patient had four seizures back to back in his sleep on May2021. The reported further stated that he has an apparatus that was put in his chest that slows the vagus nerve to seizure activity which he has had it since 2004. It was mentioned that that two weeks ago (May2021) when he was with his mom and last night that the seizures started in his sleep. He also was wetting himself which started two weeks ago (May2021) when he was with his mom. The reporter mentioned that he has blood work every 90 days (unknown date) for seizure medications and cholesterol but does not wish to provide (unknown). The father mentioned that the treatment included the patient taking his medication for his seizures as for the wets himself, he got cleaned up and puts fresh clothes on. The outcome of the event convulsions aggravated was recovered on May2021 while the outcome of the other event was recovered on 12May2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information  the reported seizures and urinary incontinence are unrelated to bnt162b2.  These are due to the patient&#39;s underlying seizure disorder.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is  received.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 24Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 54 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cholesterol. The patient was diagnosed with BPH a few years back 2016 or 2017 and had a uralist in 2019 and that resolved his issues. The patient had been on no BPH meds and back to normal since that procedure. Co-suspect medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) from an unknown date to 01Apr2021 at 40 mg, 1x/day for blood cholesterol. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced prostate infections, and abdominal discomfort. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced arm pain, and was lightheaded. He described the arm pain as he had deltoid pain but he also had pain like he had been hit from his right pectoral down his arm to about 4-5 inches above his wrist. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, sweat, urinating blood, and dark colored urine. The patient was concerned with the dark urine so he stopped taking atorvastatin, and called his physician who said he didn&#39;t need it anyhow. The patient visited the urologist office and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) as treatment for dark colored urine, urinating blood and prostate infection. On 06Apr2021, the patient experienced leukocytes in urine. Relevant lab data on 06Apr2021 included a urinalysis which resulted in leukocytes and blood &#43;3. The action taken in response to the event dark urine with atorvastatin was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events prostate infection, and abdominal discomfort was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events arm pain, and lightheaded was recovered in 26Mar2021. The outcome of the events couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, and sweat was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of the events urinating blood and dark colored urine was recovered on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the event leukocytes in urine was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the serious events Prostate infection, Blood in urine, and Urine color abnormal are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drugs. Relevant medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may provide a plausible explanation for the events.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

Ill-defined patchy opacities within the bilateral upper lobes, right middle lobe, in consolidative opacities within bilateral lower lobes which could represent aspiration, and/or multifocal pneumonia. 2. Small right trace left pleural effusions. 3. Diffusely dilated small bowel without a transition point and mucosal hyperenhancement involving the colon with areas of pneumatosis involving loops of small bowel within the left upper quadrant and portal venous air consistent with hypoperfusion complex. There is a small caliber appearance of the aorta and a flattened appearance of the IVC is well. 4. Intravascular air within the IVC and bilateral iliac veins could be secondary to right femoral central lying injection. 5. Somewhat abnormal enhancement pattern of the kidneys with hypoenhancement of the medullary pyramids which may suggest hypoperfusion injury as well. 6.

I decided to go to urgent Care and they said I was Jaundiced, they wanted me to go to the hospital, I spent 4 days in hospital, they said I was having an auto immune response to something, did scan on liver and it looked fine, however liver biopsy did not look good, they won&#39;t tell me what I have to go in for more testing. My doctor consulted with a specialist and they concluded it may be an auto immune reaction and I was told my gallbladder is also inflamed, but it looks fine , my bilirubin numbers were off the chart. I am going to see a liver specialist at medical center at the end of July. My blood sugar has since raised into diabetic range due to steroids.  I had no reaction to my first dose of covid vaccine.

Little cramping but not urinating blood for now Drank a lot of water and went away  This more than likely unrelated.  The next step you would need to take is to go to your primary care physician to get checked, if you have any updates on this please give us a call.

Lasted 3 solid, then fever began to drop day 4, but headache persisted along with sweats and violent chill. No real appetite.  Also experienced body ache, but not as bad as other symptoms.  No, or little bowel movement during this time.  On day five (today) urine output is dark, but went 18 hours without Tylenol.  Piot to that i need 2 extra strength Tylenol every 5 hours for 4 days straight.  No nausea or vomiting associated with any of this.  I have extreme fatigue due the extreme headache pain keeping me awake.  Headache on the left and right side of the head, not front or behine the eyes, more over the ears.  Today I just feel wiped out by it all, but much improved.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccines previously, including allergy, flu, shingles and pneumonia.

                                                Excruciating pain in ALL o my body.  The vaccine has triggered a Fibromyalgia episode from hell.  Extreme pain in ALL of my body.  It feels like all my nerve endings are on fire.  And when they are not on fire, they itch so bad, and I have scratched them so much, I have sores and scabs on my arms and legs from scratching a itch I can not reach.  Feels like the itching is under my skin.  Not on top.   1) Pain in ALL my body 2) High temperature - my house is 91 degrees and I&#39;m in a blanket and I&#34;m still cold 3) Even though I&#39;m cold - I sweat a lot 4) Have not been able to eat since I got the vaccine 8 days ago - growing very weak and loosing weight 5) I&#39;m dehydrated - Having trouble keeping liquids down 6) Bad stomach pains - sharp pains 7) Real bad gas and lots of it - Not normal for me 8) My kidneys hurt real bad - Probably clogged and overworked      I spend most of my time on the floor n my back.  Hurts too much to stand and walk   NOTE:  I&#39;m growing weak and very dehydrated.                   Something needs to be done soon !

I had not been able to keep down food in 10 days and for 3 days could not keep down liquids, so I went to the E/R. Pulse was down to 37bpm.  Blood had a high clotting factor as was starting to clot. Every nerve in my body felt like it was being electrified while on Fire at the same time!  Acute pain in my heart - Thought I was having a heart attack. High fever with chills and sweats.  Extreme dehydration.  And my kidneys hurt like hell.  They are taxed working overtime.   I was in such extreme pain, they had to shoot me up with Morphine every 4 hours to get it under control. They had to administer blood thinners to prevent clots.  I&#39;m still on blood thinners thanks to this damn vaccine! I was so dehydrated, they gave me 5 bags of IV Saline, a picture of Ice,  a picture of Water, then a picture of Tea, before I could even urinate.    I got to the E/R just in time before my heart stopped,  or before a clot formed and killed me.  Was in the hospital for 2 days.    I&#39;m home now, but still in pain.  I can&#39;t eat but force myself to drink liquids.  I do know if I will be getting any more vaccines...

It&#39;s been that way ever since. . .    I have real bad Fibromyalgia for over 25 years, and has been under control for 18 months now, requiring no medication / pain killers, until I received the Pfizer vaccine...    4/6/2021 7:00pm  Received 1st Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine 4/7/2021 I awoke in excruciating pain.  Every nerve in my body felt like I had been Electrocuted leaving a painful tingly sensation, while at the same time on Fire.  The pain was so bad, I could not keep down food.  After 7 days of no food and constant pain level of 7 - 9 (10 point scale) my body started rejected everything; No food or liquids at all!  After 3 more days (10 days total) I was taken to the E/R.   After several tests, they immediately put me on IV drip of Saline, IV drip of Potassium, blood thinners, and pain killers.   The vaccine triggered a &#34;High Clotting Factor&#34; in my blood and the Dr.s were worried about blood clots / stroke.  Morphine was administered to reduce my pain.   After 2 days in the hospital, 5 bags of Saline, 2 bags of Potassium, Potassium supplements, Blood Thinners, a picture of Ice, a picture of Water, a picture of Tea, and morphine shots every 4 hours, I could finally urinate, but my Kidneys hurt like hell.  They still do.  SUMMARY:  * It&#39;s been 19 days and I still can&#39;t keep down food * I&#39;m still in excruciating pain ! ! !   (have appointment with Pain Management Dr. next week) * At least I&#39;m able to keep down liquids now  * Have lost 14lbs since the vaccine * I have been bedridden ever since receiving the vaccine, the pain is that bad * Kidneys still hurt like hell * Will this pain ever end ? ? ?

Pt was recently transitioned from haldol decanoate to clozapine.  Last dose haldol decanoate was on 2/16/21. First dose clozapine 12.5 mg was on 2/24/21. Increased to 12.5 BID the following day. Increased to 25 mg BID on March 2, without reported side effects or other issues.  Pt got his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on March 4, and that night was less engaged with staff, felt feverish. Did not spike a temp per bedside accompaniment who was with him that day. The following day, he barely ate any food and did not get out of bed all day. This continued for the entirety of the weekend - bed bound, turning to look at staff when called but did not engage/respond verbally. He was incontinent of urine over the weekend.  Treated for Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 2/2 clozapine  Uncertain if vaccine contributed to event, but recent case report published relating clozapine toxicity and Pfizer COVID vaccine, so submitting to VAERS for evaluation

Found to be pancytopenic with bone marrow biopsy consistent with MDS.  He was started on chemo but stay was complicated by neutropenic fevers, epistaxis, retinal hemorrhage, AKI, fluid overload, hypoxic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and shock.  He ultimately had a heart attack while admitted and was transitioned to comfort care after medical interventions could not stabilize hemodynamics.
