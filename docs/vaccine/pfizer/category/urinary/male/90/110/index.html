                                                Approx. 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, the patient used the toilet and a large amount of bright red blood was present. Initially it was thought perhaps this was the result of hemorrhoids. On the next day, when using the toilet facilities again and upon examination, it was determined that the blood was being emitted from the patient&#39;s penis. This was a fairly heavy flow of blood that freely dripped upon standing even after emptying bladder. Rest and fluids recommended. By Sunday 02/28/2021 there was no further visible evidence of bloody urine when a nurse was sent to the home to check on the patient. The event began approximately 48 hours after injection and lasted approximately 48 hours total until resolved. There were no other accompanying symptoms  (no fever, no discomfort, etc.).

A 95-year-old male patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine ), via an unspecified route of administration in upper right arm on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for vaccination. Medical history included diabetes from 1950 (also reported as 1991) and ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced not in very good shape/terrible reactions on 16Jan2021 12:00. Requested information regarding events relative to the product. Further clarified this event as to include injection site pain; tiredness; muscle pain; feeling unwell; frequent urination every 15 minutes; signs of severe allergic reaction including dizziness, weakness and sight impairment. Patient clarified that all of these events had onset of about 12:00pm-1 hour after Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered (16Jan2021 12:00) and had for the most part remained the same since onset, but for sight impairment was on 18Jan2021. The patient did not see very well; caller had to read some of the information provided in this report from forms that patient was unable to read during report. The muscle pain was marginal. The weakness was the same or worse. He wanted a pain reliver or pill. Patient did not plan to get the second dose due to adverse events. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No emergency room/physician office visit. Family medical history relevant to the events was none. The outcome of injection site pain was recovered on 18Jan2021, tiredness, feeling unwell, dizziness was not recovered, muscle pain, frequent urination every 15 minutes was recovering, severe allergic reaction, weakness, sight impairment was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.
