                                                Fatigue but only in evening. Able to work. Irregular heart beat (not normal intermittent PVC) that caused chest discomfort. Nothing concerning, just more curious. With second vaccine, developed chills within one hour and went to bed. Upon awakening, had headache, nausea, chills, kidney area pain, chest discomfort from irregular heart beat. This resolved for about 18 hours, then started again and lasted for 1 week. Chest pain became sharp at times  spreading to arm with mild shortness of breath. Having had a full heart workup last year, did not pursue tests. wanted to see if would pass on it&#39;s own. After one week, only have occasional chest discomfort. Arrhythmia has returned to baseline occasional PVC. No further chills, headache, nausea or other pains.

                                                Since the week after the first Pfizer vaccine, I began struggling with symptoms of diabetes. I experienced extreme thirst, frequent urination and  I lost 17 pounds in the 3 weeks following the first dose. I never associated it with the vaccine, initially, because I never heard of any side effects like increased glucose, and my dad and sister have type 2 diabetes, so I was altering my diet, but the symptoms did not subside. I proceeded to get the second vaccine and that?s when I knew something was seriously wrong. That afternoon my blood sugar was 528, my vision was blurred, and I experienced a strange feeling in my heart. I was diagnosed by my GP with diabetes, and put on medication (Metformin and Glipizide). I proceeded to see an endocrinologist, I was put on insulin and after additional blood tests was diagnosed with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes , and Premature Atrial Complexes.

This 60-year-old female patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 27Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8731) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing congestive heart failure, diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Concomitant medication(s) included aripiprazole (ABILIFY) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; atorvastatin calcium (ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported, noted as on of the 2 new heart medication; and another unspecified heart medication. No other vaccine within 4 weeks.  The patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 27Apr2021, then 2 days later on 29Apr2021 she developed side effects of body aches and couldn&#39;t get comfortable sitting, laying down, or standing, and her feet hurt, the top of her feet hurt really super bad and her legs hurt. She stated she was feeling &#34;fair to partly cloudy&#34; and &#34;this is just beyond anything&#34;. She stated she literally didn&#39;t want to exist anymore the pain was that horrible, that when she was experiencing adverse effects she couldn&#39;t get comfortable in any way, nowhere to go, nothing to do, no warm bath, no hot warm or cool compresses, it was just her whole body. She said there was nothing that would help and she just didn&#39;t know if she could do that again. She only had relief through paracetamol (TYLENOL) and she took so much that she felt her liver was in jeopardy. She stated it was a really bad experience. The patient was also having incredible chest pressure and shortness of breath, onset date unspecified. She had a diagnosis of heart failure/a history of congestive heart failure, with the body aches she was having, she thought she was going into heart failure. She did call an ambulance twice (maybe 29Apr2021 then 01May2021; she didn&#39;t remember exactly which days) and the emergency medical technicians (EMT) took an EKG each time. The first time she called the ambulance the EMT&#39;s offered to take her to the hospital. Her EKG did look abnormal but it could have been attributed to her history of heart related issues or anxiety. The second time her chest started hurting it was hard to distinguish between pain and pressure. There was definitely pressure. There was also pain across her breasts (onset date unspecified) and underneath her arm (on 29Apr2021; initially she was pressing under her arm and she had pain really bad there), she was questioning her lymph nodes. Then the pain went around her back and then her whole back started hurting and her whole body was hurting, onset date 29Apr2021. She had never experienced anything like this before, as stated. She also reported that her concentration levels were off (onset date unspecified). She couldn&#39;t listen to music or do anything like that. She spoke with her doctor but being that sick made her so weary (onset date unspecified). The patient reported she didn&#39;t know if her symptoms were because of the COVID-19 vaccine or because of her new heart medication, but she said it&#39;s stupid to think her symptoms could be caused from her new pills. Her doctor wanted blood work on 27Apr2021 primarily because of all the medical diseases she had. She&#39;s guessing maybe blood work would give her an indication of why the vaccine made her feel the way it did. She went on 05May2021 to get bloodwork. She went to the bathroom 12 times a night to urinate (onset date unspecified) and she asked her doctor to put her on Lasix so she could just get the urine out. The doctor told her that her heart and her lungs sound good.  The patient asked if she should still get the second dose of the vaccine as she was worried that the symptoms could be worse after the second dose. She was supposed to return for her second COVID-19 vaccine on 14May2021, but she was not going (though she knew she needed to get the second dose), she did not want to get it.  The events body aches, feet hurting/legs hurting, pain underneath her arm, back pain, were ongoing but lessened in severity. As of the time of reporting, she had started to feel better, these events (body aches, feet hurting/legs hurting, pain underneath her arm, back pain) were resolving. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

Could not perform my work duties. Progressed to Rigors. Lasted at least 3 hrs in it&#39;s severest form. Now, 24 hrs later I still have some hand tremors, and legs are weak. Shoulder, knees, hips achy. I&#39;m very fatigued.  Right arm soreness @ injection site. All events were reported. I was sent home from work, had to be driven home. I rested, slept and hydrated the remainder of the day. Did not go to work today.

                                                61 yo F with history of bilateral lung transplant 6/23/17 presented to ED on 2/4/21 with chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath, nausea and diarrhea for past week since receiving since receiving COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 1/28/21. Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 05Mar2021 1:45 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the BNT162B2. Medical history included allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, brain barrier fever, epilepsy, encephalitis and meningitis. She had epilepsy as a child. She gets epilepsy when she gets sick. The last 4 times she got sick she had a seizure. The last seizure was 1 year ago (in 2020). She may have had COVID, but she got really sick and had a seizure. She is not sure if it was COVID or not. If it was the flu, she does not want that again. She had ataxia and ended up in hospital two times but did not stay. Prior to this, she did not go to hospital for 30 years. She was unable to walk, her gait was real bad. The neurological disorder messed her up for a while. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE first dose and experienced autoimmune response. After the vaccine, she had pain and tingling sensation from head to her to spine (05Mar2021), BP dropped to 70/40 (06Mar2021), seizures (06Mar2021), and delayed allergic reaction (Mar2021). She wanted to know if she should take the second dose or not. She also wanted to know if that would be considered the anaphylactic reaction. It was also reported that the patient experienced funny taste in mouth, back pain, hands tingling on 05Mar2021. The patient further explained that when she got the shot, she had a funny taste in her mouth. It started immediately after she got the vaccine and it lasted 30 minutes. She mentioned this to the people at the facility, but they said she was crazy and no one else has mentioned this. She thought they would be interested, but they did not care. About 20 minutes later she had a tingly sensation. It was in the back of her head that developed into a stingy, painful, heat, funny type feeling. It was all the way down to her back. She later further explained the back of her head was tingling (05Mar2021). Like were the cerebellum is to spine. This sensation is still there, but better. After she felt this feeling her back then started hurting. She bent over and her back went out. She felt achy. She already had what she called a tweaky muscle (05Mar2021). She had pulled a muscle in her back, but it was nothing that had caused a problem. After getting the COVID vaccine it triggered an immune response in her body. She started to have pain at the top of her head down to her hip (05Mar2021). She bent over and she could not stand up (05Mar2021). Her husband had to help her put her pants on and sit down due to this. She started to have horrible back pain (05Mar2021). She could hardly move (05Mar2021). She was having trouble walking (05Mar2021). She was having trouble holding her urine (05Mar2021). On Saturday evening (06Mar2021), her blood pressure started dropping and she later had a seizure. After the seizure occurred it seems like everything got better and she did not have any trouble since. It was very scary. She mentioned she was in the bathroom and there was a tub full of water. She had a hard time already getting to the bathroom. She was in a lot of pain. The amount of pain she had she thinks affected her blood pressure. She had pain in the back, middle of her back. It started at her head, back of head, down her spine, came down to her back and hips. She was hurting a lot and having a terribly hard time getting around. She could hardly walk. She was going to the bathroom because she felt like she had to go. Her husband was helping her sit on the toilet. When she stood up it was like her blood pressure dropped, she almost went headfirst in the tub full of water, but her husband caught her, laid her down, and had a seizure. This was a very unnerving feeling. The seizure did not last more than a minute, maybe two at the very most. The seizure occurred probably around 6PM or 7PM. It did not last long at all. She woke up on the floor. She had been sitting and she thought she had fallen off the toilet. However, her husband had to remind her that a few things happened in between. She almost fell in the bathtub and she has glass doors. She mentioned she felt as clarified and confirmed sped up. She did fall into a cabinet and is bruised up from that seizure (06Mar2021). She is sore from the pain from that. Still inflamed (06Mar2021) possibly due to the seizure. Like she has ruminants of what occurred to back of head, cerebellum. Before she had the seizure, her blood pressure had started dropping. It started dropping in the evening around 5PM or 5:30PM. Mentioned she is a little confused about the time onset because she was hurting so much and bad all day. She does not take any pain medication. She has an autoimmune disease and it is difficult for her to take medications. On top of that, if she wanted to take an Aspirin she was told she should not take one. She was informed she was trying to promote an auto-immune response to the vaccine. As the day ran on, she was in a lot of pain. She had been in pain since Friday and was trying to deal with that. The patient further stated her blood pressure is back, no illness. After the seizure her blood pressure went back to normal and at this time it is perfectly fine. The back pain she experienced went from the brain down to her backbone. The pain is gone. It started to go away after the seizure and by Sunday 07Mar2021 it was totally gone. At first it was like she could not walk (05Mar2021). It was like she/her back was on fire (05Mar2021). The patient also mentioned if she moves her head quickly, she can feel like she will have a headache, hangover. She feels it in her back. She feels like she is near recovery, and this is a feeling she does not thing will stay. She further went on to say her hip where she fell is a different story. However, this is associated to a fall and not a vaccine. She was having this problem when she had the vaccine, but the vaccine caused it to be more and extra aggravating.  She later added, when she first got home along with head tingling her hands were tingling as well. When her brain and hands were going through this tingling sensation, she started to notice the back trouble and it was also in her abdomen area and in her legs causing trouble walking (05Mar2021). The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events trouble walking, could not walk, tingling sensation and hangover was recovering. Outcome of BP dropped to 70/40 was recovered on Mar2021. Outcome of seizures recovered on 06Mar2021. Outcome of funny taste in mouth was recovered on 05Mar2021. Outcome of back pain was recovered on 07Mar2021. Outcome of bruised up was not recovered. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient provided an unrelated causality between the vaccine and event fall.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Fall is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.

This 61-year-old female contactable pharmacist(Patient) reported for herself that she received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot: EL3302) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation on 29Mar2021. Relevant history included Urinary incontinence. Relevant concomitant drug included estradiol (ESTRING) for Urinary incontinence, had been a few years already. The patient (pharmacist) said the dose of vaccine was 0.5mL but cannot verify that dose information at the reporting time. This patient stated the last few days the Estring had not been working; she did not know if they didn&#39;t put enough estrogen (1 count 2mg strength) in the ring or if the ring ran out of Estrogen, like at the end of the thing, or if the Estring not working was due to a defect. She clarified that the Estring has not been working because she has had 2 episodes of urinary incontinence, urinary incontinence outcome provided as worsened. First episode happened like 09Apr2021, and the second episode happened last night, 13Apr2021. These episodes were upsetting, annoying and embarrassing. This particular vaginal ring involved in this report was inserted intravaginally on 21Jan2021 and was still in place intravaginally. No change performed as of yet, but she was getting a new Estring today and is going to see if that one works. Because of Covid pandemic she had basically been home but she normally visited friends and may stay over and it would have been really embarrassing if she was staying over and had urinary incontinence episodes; she would probably have to wear a diaper if she stayed over which would be really embarrassing. The event was not considered as life-threatening.  The urinary incontinence outcome was not resolved (worsened). She was scheduled for her second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 26Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained

I had to spit out the saliva, which helped, but it still lingered for a few minutes.    2nd reaction -Day 1 After several hours, I experienced swelling in my right arm, and diarrhea.  I also had insomnia, and slept very little the night of the shot.  Day 2  I had loose stools, slight nauseous feeling most of the day. My body odor smelled like onions.  I also had bad muscle aches and fatigue. That night, I had insomnia again and slight chills.  Day 3 Still had loose stools, fatigue and muscle aches. The onion smell comes and goes.  I experienced excessive urination throughout the day (about once an hour, which is not usual for me).    Day 4 Muscle aches and fatigue are gone,    Day 5 Excessive urination again.  Onion smell comes and goes.

On March 18th, 2021 I had a spontaneous anaphylactic reaction requiring the use of Benadryl and an inhaler. 40 minutes after second injection (Apr. 2nd, 2021) my face became bright red - which is usually the beginnings of an allergic or non-tolerant reaction to something to which I&#39;ve come in contact.  A Benadryl dose resolved this reaction within 20 minutes. On April 10th I had a spontaneous anaphylactic reaction requiring the use of Benadryl. 12 Days after second dose I noticed my tongue feeling raw and started feeling a UTI beginning.  By 14 days after second dose I had approximately 14 pea sized lumps on the back and back sides of my tongue, the gums of my teeth were very swollen and sore. The roots of my teeth ached terribly, chewing was very difficult.  My ears were both very itchy deep within.  I was seen my my physician on  April 20th, 2021 and diagnosed with Candida Overgrowth.

                                                Just wondering if anyone else has reported blood in their urine.  About 3 weeks after receiving the first dose I saw blood in my urine for 3 days (April 10, 11, 12).  I was going to see a doctor, but the issue disappeared and I had no other symptoms (fever, pain, etc.) that one would associate with a bladder infection or UTI.  (BTW, I have never ever had a bladder infection or UTI.)  After hearing about some patients developing blood clots after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I wondered if the Pfizer vaccine had caused some sort of clot to form in my bladder and then dissolved and was eliminated when I urinated.  I am waiting to see if the same thing will happen now that I&#39;ve received the second shot....

A 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 31Mar2021 (at the age of 62-years-old) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia from 1996 and ongoing, allergies from 1981 and ongoing, hypothyroidism and is pre-diabetic from 2012 and ongoing, Lyme disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, concussion from Sep2019 to an unknown date, post-concussion syndrome from Sep2019 and ongoing , seasonal, food and chemical allergies from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and had wisdom teeth extracted on an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took nalbuphine hydrochloride (NUBAIN) and experienced anaphylaxis. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206), administered in right arm on 10Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced Face and ears became very flushed, red, and itchy, Headache, headache was more like a migraine/felt like a migraine, but worse, Post concussion syndrome was retriggered, not eating well and had lost some weight, feeling more worn out, she is allergic to alcohol and thought maybe it was the glycol in the COVID-19 vaccine that caused the reaction, flu like symptoms, achiness all over, pelvic pain and pressure, some burning during urination, did not have the energy level and stamina that she used to, blood in her urine and clots, she was not able to release the urine (urine retention), Nausea and Dizziness. About a week after receiving the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 31Mar2021, she noticed the feeling again of retaining the urine. She was not swollen or anything and immediately went with increased fluids. The urine retention was not as severe at that point. It really showed up and intensified quickly with groin pain, pelvic pain, abdominal pain, and some back pain. She woke up the next morning after being doubled over in pain the night before and there was so much blood in her urine that she couldn&#39;t see any urine. Her urine was the darkest burgundy and the color of the darkest wine. She did not have anything in her urine the night before when she was doubled over in pain. She was increasing fluids and even drinking Propel for the electrolytes to make sure she was not making things worse. She woke up around 5 AM and felt so sick to her stomach. She had nausea the night before, but she was really nauseated the morning that she discovered blood in her urine. She woke up with severe nausea last Friday, 30Apr2021. Her doctor performed a urine culture. The urine culture returned positive for Klebsiella Pneumoniae with 50,000 to 100,000 CFU/mL on 30Apr2021. She does not have the urine culture results from her first doctor visit. Her friend is an RN that is administering the Covid-19 vaccine, was talking to company representatives and told the caller that she needed to call company to make a report and see if anyone else has experienced the same adverse events. Urinary retention came back in Apr2021 following her second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 31Mar2021. She can really go to the bathroom, but she is still feeling the abdominal and pelvic pressure as well as some burning and pain. Her symptoms are improving but not enough. It feels like she always has a full bladder still. She tore or messed up a ligament in her hand and she has been going to occupational therapy. She can&#39;t seem to be able to handle a pain level like she used to. It seems like pain is triggering her feelings of nausea and dizziness. Her body is not doing things well right now. The day before, of, and after getting the Covid-19 vaccine, someone suggested taking electrolytes before the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, so she drank Powerade. She was expecting the symptoms following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to be a lot worse and they were a walk in the park in comparison. She had a mild headache the first day, 31Mar2021. She woke up in the morning of 01Apr2021 and her headache was gone. Following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, she had severe arm pain. It felt like she was walking around with someone constantly punching her. She was moving her arm all around trying to get it to stop hurting. She saw blood and blood clots in her urine for over 24 hours. The blood and clots were lessening over the 24-hour time period. She probably saw in a 2-hour period at least 60 clots about the size of a quarter to a half dollar. The pain was excruciating. She was taking Phenazopyridine but is still feeling a sense of urgency, burning, and sometimes pain during urination. Her doctor did give her a prescription for phenazopyridine, but it was cheaper for her to buy over the counter and take the same dosage. She has been taking generic Macrobid, Nitrofurantoin Mono, 100 mg twice daily. It was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. She is seeing a urogynecologist tomorrow, 06May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included culture urine: unknown cfu on 26Mar2021 and culture urine: klebsiella pneumoniae, 50,000 to 100,000 cfu on 30Apr2021. The outcome of the event Headache was recovered on 01Apr2021 while of the rest was unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information on lot number already obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable nurse (patient) via a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 10Mar2021, as 1st dose, single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia (diagnosed in 1996), ongoing allergies from 1981, ongoing food allergies and chemical allergies, ongoing allergy to alcohol, ongoing hypothyroidism from 2012, ongoing pre-diabetic from 2012, Lyme disease for 11 years before being correctly diagnosed and treated, concussion in Sep2019, and post concussion syndrome in Sep2019. The patient previously took nalbuphine hydrochloride (NUBAIN) in 1981 and experienced anaphylaxis; and paracetamol (TYLENOL) and was very sensitive, had rash and high blood pressure. Within the first 15 to 20 minutes following the administration of the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, on 10Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face and ears got very red, flushed, and itchy. The patient reported that she is allergic to alcohol and thought maybe it was the glycol in the COVID-19 vaccine that caused the reaction. She reported that she has had glycol before and has never reacted quite like that. The flushing, redness, and itchiness of her face and ears subsided within an hour and were gone by 4 hours. Her allergist instructed her to take 2 Zyrtec before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. After her face and ears became flushed, red, and itchy, she ended up having a really bad headache that continued until the next day. Her headache was severe for about 12 hours and continued for a total of a day and a half.  She stated that her headache was more like a migraine during the 12 hours when it was severe. It felt like a migraine, but worse. On 10Mar2021, the patient reported that she experienced flu-like symptoms like being nauseous, had dizziness, achiness all over, and was not feeling well, her post-concussion syndrome was triggered and had more headaches, dizziness, nausea. She reported that things have been going awry in her body since she had the COVID-19 vaccine. She reported that the increase in headaches seemed to have improved, but the nausea and dizziness have in some ways improved and then some days it feels like &#34;here we go again&#34; when it hits. About a week after she received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, in Mar2021, the patient noticed a change in her urination. It wasn&#39;t severe or anything at that point, she just felt like she was not able to release the urine (urine retention). She thought to increase her intake to see if it would help her urinate and it didn&#39;t seem to help much. She received a prescription on 26Mar2021, and during that week, she noticed that she was having more issues with some burning during urination and was developing pelvic pain and pressure. The patient stated that the scent and color of her urine looked fine.  She reported that the frequency started to increase with not much urine coming out. When she finished her antibiotics about 7 days later, the urine retention had really improved and went away at the end of March. In the morning of 26Mar2021, when the patient woke up, she had blood in her urine and clots. The clots were about the size of a pea and a couple were about the size of a dime. The blood and blood clots in her urine were what made her go to the doctor. She reported she has never had blood in her urine that she remembers. She was put on Macrobid for 5 days. She reported that Macrobid wasn&#39;t relieving enough of her symptoms and her provider ended up adding a couple more days. The patient reported feeling more worn out in Mar2021, since she received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This did not improve and some days it was worse. The patient did not have the energy level and stamina that she used to (Mar2021). She reported that whether it&#39;s combined with the retriggering of her post-concussion syndrome, it is significant for her life. She was also not eating well and had lost some weight (Mar2021). She reported that her appetite is improving but it is still not normal for her. She mentioned it was harder for her to want to eat something because of feeling nauseated. The patient assessed the events &#34;face and ears became very flushed, red, and itchy&#34;, headache, &#34;headache was more like a migraine/felt like a migraine, but worse&#34;, &#34;post concussion syndrome was retriggered&#34;, &#34;blood in her urine and clots&#34;, &#34;not eating well and had lost some weight&#34; and &#34;feeling more worn out&#34; as serious (medically significant). The patient recovered from &#34;face and ears became very flushed, red, and itchy&#34; and &#34;she is allergic to alcohol and thought maybe it was the glycol in the COVID-19 vaccine that caused the reaction&#34; on 10Mar2021; headache, &#34;headache was more like a migraine/felt like a migraine, but worse&#34;, &#34;she was not able to release the urine (urine retention)&#34;, &#34;blood in her urine and clots&#34;, &#34;flu like symptoms&#34;, dizziness, &#34;achiness all over&#34;, &#34;pelvic pain and pressure&#34;, and &#34;some burning during urination&#34; in Mar2021; and was recovering from &#34;not eating well and had lost some weight&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient assessed the causality of events headache, flu like symptoms, nausea, &#34;face and ears became very flushed, red, and itchy&#34;, dizziness, &#34;post concussion syndrome was retriggered&#34;, and &#34;not eating well and had lost some weight&#34; as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information in the case report and a plausible temporal association, A possible causal relationship between urinary retention, hemorrhage urinary tract and suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.

Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3) 1000 IU, once a day, by mouth (Taken these for as long as she can remember, they kept advising it, husband takes it for Parkinson&#39;s so she just throws one in for her), calcium ascorbate (VITAMIN C) 1000 IU, once a day, by mouth (Started at least 2 years ago, doesn&#39;t drink enough orange juice, doesn&#39;t do fruits, doesn&#39;t get enough Vitamin C), linum usitatissimum seed oil (FLAXSEED OIL) 1000 IU, once a day, by mouth (Started at least 2 years ago, family history of cardiac and heart disease, takes as preventative) for cardiac and heart disease, takes as preventative, fish oil 1000 IU, once a day, by mouth (Started at least 2 years ago, family history of cardiac and heart disease, takes as preventative) for family history of cardiac and heart disease, takes as preventative, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril 20/12.5 mg, once a day, by mouth (She has been taking this medication for years, under control with this medication) for High Blood Pressure, lansoprazole from 2020 30 mg, once a day, by mouth (Started years ago) for Stomach pill for acid reflux, duloxetine hydrochloride 60 mg, once at bedtime, by mouth (Started forever ago) for just being achy and anxiety, lorazepam .05 mg, 1 tablet 3 times a day, takes one tablet a day at bedtime, by mouth for Anxiety (Started this a while back- with the heart disease and everything else, gave this to help with menopause symptoms too), meloxicam 15 mg, at bedtime as needed from 2017 for back issues- really sore at times, takes if really stressed or she overdoes it. Patient previously took Tylenol for sinus headache and does not have an effect on her. After the first dose of the vaccine the patient reported that she was extremely tired on 11Mar2021. She was completely nauseated most of the day on the second day. On Saturday, she was extremely nauseated (12Mar2021) with vomiting and major diarrhea on 13Mar2021. By 4 PM that afternoon (12Mar2021), she could not function because she was so cold; she felt like she was in a really bad dream and couldn&#39;t wake up. She called on 13Mar2021, her blood pressure was so low-they got 58 for the top number, they were unable to pull up bottom number at that point. patient reported that when the ambulance arrived, they described her face as extremely pale on 13Mar2021; her major complaint was that she was so cold- she has never been that cold in her life. When she got to the ER- they had to use the old blood pressure cuff to get her blood pressure because it wasn&#39;t coming up on the machine- the kind where you pump it up and watch the needle, they said it was 58/38. patient states that they asked her about the rash that was all over her body in 2021; caller reports that she did not have a rash when she called at 4 PM. patient describes the rash as an extremely red sunburn rash- like you got really bad sunburn, most of it was on her torso, she also had it on legs on 13Mar2021. patient mentioned she remembers them taking off sock and her toes were purple on 13Mar2021. She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021. Discharge paper reads as anaphylaxis due to vaccination on 13Mar2021. patient states that she came home from hospital on Monday, 15Mar2021. patient reports she started a diet. 2nd day (12Mar2021)- From the time she got up, she was too cold to do anything; she couldn&#39;t walk and she was feeling like she was getting the flu. Saturday (13Mar2021)- She woke up and had the worst Charlie horse between ankle and calf- took forever to walk Charlie horse off. Really sharp Charlie horse. Even had less energy today. Really nauseated. patient reports that yesterday and today, she is just tired. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her body catching up on sleep or she&#39;s just tired; she will find out today when she goes to doctor. Caller mentions that she is normally more active than she feels right now. patient reports her eyes have been itchy and she has a rash on her eyelids. patient doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the shot; patient mentions that she decided on 01Mar2021 she would start a diet, get healthy, and see a nutritionist. patient reports that initially she didn&#39;t think her symptoms were from the vaccine and thought it was that she wasn&#39;t eating enough food on Friday. She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

That evening she had a fever, surprising to her as it was already the 2nd day.  The next day from there Wednesday, was weak, a little dizzy.  Then on Thursday she started feeling very very dizzy, she felt it coming on and about 10 minutes after she felt that she felt as is she was going to faint, very dizzy feeling.  She said it out loud so that somebody could recognize she was having problems.  She slumped into the chair with dizziness and not feeling well, a lot of weakness.   Since yesterday the sore throat has continued, and has had a cough since the beginning also.  She also had on Tuesday some diarrhea, but nothing too serious  Since yesterday she is still dizzy, has a canker sore, lips feel a little more puffy, still has headache.  She does not feel that she needs to go to the hospital, but still feeling unwell.  She also did have the arm pain at the injection site, and felt that she was getting better as her reaction didn&#39;t seem so severe and went away quickly.  She did not take anything for her symptoms.   She also did have burning on urination.   She also had chest discomfort/burniness.

A 63-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (at the age of 63-year-old) as 1st DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization. Patient took vaccine as she wanted to fly on an airplane and not worry as heavily. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus, patient had diabetes for at least 5 years, ongoing high blood pressure from an unknown date, reporter think patient high blood pressure was more with her weight because patient was obese. Patient was immunocompromised with her diabetes. Patient had no relevant family medical history. Concomitant medication included ongoing metformin (METFORMIN) taken for diabetes mellitus. Patient has been on it for years. Reporter believed she was on the max dose that she thinks was 2000mg, but could be wrong. Patient was not eating or drinking from 03Apr2021 and did throw up. On 06Apr2021 patient was tested positive for Covid and experienced hypoglycemic shock at 11:00, renal failure and Covid fog. Reportedly, patient also experienced viral pneumonia, mobility issues, gets out of breath easily, weak, her blood sugar was 28, covid fog, couldn&#39;t remember anything which wasn&#39;t normal, wbc was elevated and headache. The patient was hospitalized for hypoglycemic shock and COVID-19 from 06Apr2021 to 17Apr2021 (11 days), then discharged and was told by her HCP to wait 8-12 weeks before getting second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine. Patient scheduled to receive second vaccine dose 15May2021. Reporter was told that it was a max of 42 days that patient can get the second dose of the vaccine, but that has obviously since passed. They want patient to come in and get a second first shot. When patient was admitted, the doctor thought patient had viral pneumonia already for at least a week, so it would have started about when she got the shot. Patient was better, she was not on oxygen anymore, but she still gets out of breath easily. Patients mobility issues started when she came down with symptoms. Patient had renal failure and was weak. Patient was not eating or drinking. Patient was diabetic and she had hypoglycemic shock which was what put her in the hospital. Reporter thought it was probably a cold or flu or something and Easter happened where she was not hungry and did throw up. Reporter thought it was something she ate that was bad. When she had the hypoglycemic shock reporter could not wake her and patient was in some kind of unresponsive state from 11:00 to about 15:45. Patient blood sugar was 28 when the paramedics arrived. They were able to get her responsive and transferred her to the hospital. They ended up putting her on a dextrose drip because they could not keep her blood sugar up. They put her on steroids and the number went sky high into the 500s and they could not control it in the hospital. There was a lot of stuff that happened. Reporter did not believe that patient has any lasting effects from the hypoglycemic shock. Patient sugar was back to normal and she was on her normal medications. Patient was off insulin which they gave her in the hospital, so that part was okay. Patient was dealing with Covid fog also. Reporter does not know if it has to do with blood sugar or how the virus attacks the body. Patient had multiple MRIs because they were worried, she had a stroke, and she said she could not remember anything which was not normal. Patient not eating and drinking started right before Easter and was much better. Reporter believed that at about 14Apr2021 or so patient started to eat better and have more of an appetite for food. Patient has recovered completely. The reporter did not notice the Covid fog until her mother was in the hospital on 06Apr2021. She does not remember her first week in the hospital, and then even when she was discharged on 17Apr2021 that whole next week she was still very foggy. The reporter would say she was better now. patient talks normally and was back to swearing which is perfectly her. Patient has recovered completely at this point. Patient mobility was better. Patient was not using the walker in the house today, and her balance was better. It was probably due to some of the side effects of the medicines they added like a beta blocker and other things to make sure she was okay. Regarding kidney failure started, reporter stated on 06Apr2021 patient creatinine was 3.99. Patient also had a high D dimer and were worried about her clotting and throwing a PE or something. That was mostly in the first few days around the 6Apr2021, 7Apr2021, 8Apr2021, 9 Apr2021, 10Apr2021 when they were not sure what was going to happen. The following week patient was still at 5 to 6 liters of oxygen, but by Friday night 16Apr2021 she was down to 1 liter of oxygen. Patient did not come home on oxygen. Reporter believed patient kidneys have recovered, but she did not know. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatinine: 1.47 on an unknown date, 0.97 on Sep2020, reporter does not know if it returned to 0.97, but the last number she knows of was 1.47, 3.99 on 06Apr2021, blood creatinine: 1.47 on 17Apr2021. Patient had normal bloodwork in Sep2020 and her creatinine was 0.97. Reporter did not know if it returned to 0.97, but the last number she knows of was 1.47. That would have been when patient was discharged from the hospital. Blood glucose: 500s on an unknown date in Apr2021, blood glucose: 28 on 06Apr2021. On 06Apr2021 patient was tested positive for Covid. On an unknown date patient got CT, high d dimer, CBC, MRI, metabolic function test, white blood cell count, X-ray and Chem 28. Reportedly, bloodwork were done daily in the hospital, and patient has had bloodwork once since she was discharged. WBC was elevated so they did a blood culture to make sure patient did not have an infection. The culture was negative. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There was no prior vaccination within 4 weeks. There were predisposing factors diabetes and immunosuppression. Patient started Tylenol pill on 06Apr2021 after vaccination at an unknown dose. They gave it to her continuously because she had bad headaches. They started her on antivirals and took her off of Remdesivir because of her kidneys. They put her on a different antiviral that the reporter did not remember the name of and a biologic. Home health just discharged patient, and she was still dealing with viral pneumonia and mobility issues. Patient was still on different medicines and she normally was not. The report is related to study or programme. The outcome of the event hypoglycemic shock was recovered on 06Apr2021 and was not eating or drinking was recovered on 14Apr2021, viral pneumonia, mobility issues, was recovering, renal failure, positive for covid 19, gets out of breath easily, weak, her blood sugar was 28, went sky high into the 500s and they couldn&#39;t control it in the hospital, covid fog, couldn&#39;t remember anything which wasn&#39;t normal, wbc was elevated, throw up and headaches was unknown.

                                                forceful beat feeling in her chest/she was really uncomfortable in her chest, the force was the most uncomfortable at this point; seemed like UTI symptoms were coming back; felt really wiped out and worn down/tired; anxiety; racing/ pounding in chest; potassium was a little low; elevated blood pressure; arm a little bit sore; 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 64-year-old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EJ1685), via intramuscular on 28Dec2020 07:15 at single dose on deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hepatitis C which cleared in 2016, hysterectomy was done in 2004 or 2005, cyst removed from breast long ago, ongoing arthritis in left knee, urinary tract infection was treated in Nov2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She received the first vaccine on 28Dec2020. She did fine that day. She came home and laid down and rested. Her temperature went up to 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit but was resolved that same day/night. Early in the morning on 29Dec2020, around 3:30 a.m., she woke up and had a racing/pounding feeling in her chest. She took her blood pressure and it was 158/86, heart rate (HR) was 83. She felt really funny. She hadn&#39;t been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, so this was high for her. She took her blood pressure again about an hour later and it was 165/95, HR 73. She took it again about an hour later and her blood pressure read 180/98, HR 77. Her heart rate stayed in the normal range, but the force felt really strong. She did go to the emergency room around 5:00 am on 29Dec2020. She told them what she was experiencing and that she had received the COVID-19 vaccine. About the time she got to the hospital, her blood pressure was starting to come down. An EKG was done and they drew bloodwork. Her potassium came back a little low-they didn&#39;t tell her how low or what her level was. She was given 2 potassium tablets which did help. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the potassium she was given. It was given to her at the hospital. She was also given a sheet to monitor her salt intake, which she already does that. She confirmed she was not admitted into the hospital, she was discharged from the Emergency Room. She felt pretty good. She didn&#39;t go to work that Wednesday, 30Dec2020, but she went to work on Thursday, 31Dec2020. On 01Jan2021, the same thing happened to her again. She had elevated blood pressure, forceful beat. She went back to the ER early in the morning, around 5:00 am, on 01Jan2021. Her pulse stayed within normal range, but she had such a forceful beat. She informed them that she was really uncomfortable in her chest, the force was the most uncomfortable at this point. They wanted to make sure she wasn&#39;t have a stroke or heart attack, so they did their normal procedures to rule this out. They did 2 EKG&#39;s, 2 sets of labs, Chest X-ray, CAT scan and everything came back normal. She had a discussion with the physician that saw her about what she was experiencing and the physician was asking her about having anxiety. Caller explains she has never really had problems with anxiety before, but she can&#39;t say she hasn&#39;t had it. Being around COVID patients and getting the shot, sometimes anxiety can be there. The physician wanted her to try a low dose of Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg. She was to only to take a half dose by mouth, if her top number (systolic blood pressure) was between 140-160. Caller clarifies when she means half of a dose, the dose equals 12.5mg. She was instructed to take this 12.5mg dose until she saw her PCP. So, she did this and called her PCP and wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment to speak with a provider until the following Wednesday, 06Jan2021. She did a tele visit with her provider and let her know what had happened and that the half of the pill will only bring her top number (systolic blood pressure) to 130&#39;s-140&#39;s. Caller states she was used to her top number (systolic) being maybe in the 120&#39;s, low 130&#39;s. Her doctor increased her dose to 25mg. She was prescribed to take 25mg, tablet, by mouth, once a day. She confirmed she still checks her blood pressure before she takes the medicine. Caller verifies she has 2 bottles, one being the 12.5mg dose and the second being the 25mg dose. With the 12.5mg bottle, she sees refills and the date 05Jan2022. Caller clarifies both bottles are dispensed in pharmacy vials with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date. About a month prior to all of this and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, clarified as Nov2020, she was treated for a UTI. During that time, her blood pressure went up a little and kind of bounced around a little bit, but came back down. Then, she got the COVID-19 shot. She initially felt fine but later on by the time she got a chance to do the tele visit with her PCP, she was telling her about her previous UTI, and the provider put her on Cipro because it seemed like her UTI symptoms were coming back. Caller verifies she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration for the Cipro. She already took of all of that. She went to the ER for the third time on 08Jan2021 because she again felt the forceful beat feeling in her chest. She explained she felt really wiped out and worn down and she was tired. An EKG was done and they did labs. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any results with her at this time. She was taken off of work for a couple of weeks. She is currently getting in contact with a Cardiologist to make sure everything is alright. The cardiologist wants her to have a stress test. The caller states so this is where she is now. She is taking blood pressure medicine and getting set up to do a stress test. Sore arm outcome: Caller confirms she recovered from the arm soreness within that same day. Her arm didn&#39;t stay sore long at all. Racing/pounding in chest: This had improved. It&#39;s not like it was. She still has it a little bit of it now, but she is going to see her cardiologist and do a stress test. The blood pressure medicine has helped some. Elevated blood pressure: Today her blood pressure top number got to 161 and she had to take medication but her blood pressure has improved. Outcome of elevated blood pressure, racing/ pounding in chest was resolving; outcome of forceful beat feeling in her chest, UTI, potassium was a little low, felt really wiped out and worn down/tired, anxiety was unknown; outcome of arm a little bit sore, 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit fever was resolved on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

A 64-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 06Apr2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, at 64 years old.

Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal from 2016 and ongoing; and nadolol (CORGARD) taken for an unspecified indication from 2001 and ongoing. Patient&#39;s son got COVID on an unspecified date. Patient previously took generic atorvastatin which made her sick on an unspecified date and LIPITOR and experienced muscle weakness on an unspecified date. No additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer vaccine. No prior vaccinations. Patient never got a flu shot as she was scared. On 06Apr2021, her arm was sore which is normal. Normal side effects from the arm did not concern her, patient had no fever nothing else.  She stated she came home and felt like she had to use the bathroom a couple hours after the shot.

She was worried she needs to go to the cardiologist and see what is happening. She stated if it keeps happening, she will go, and she does not know if this is a side effect other people are reporting. Patient was wondering if this is a reaction as she cannot find it, one says a severe reaction is a fast heartbeat, really fast and skipping and she does not know. She expected anything, tired, headache, muscle aches but these did not happen, but she was expecting them to. Patient is wondering why her heart is doing that is it from the shot or what is going on with her which is weird, and stated the shaking, trembling of her whole body is weird.

A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, at age 64 years, administered in left arm on 05Apr2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, in order to go back to normal, without a mask so she was told she had to have one. Medical history included hysterectomy, anxiety, disorder in thyroid and cholesterol. Patient had family history of dementia, had to stay home and take care of her mom who is a heart patient and has dementia. Patient had no history of previous immunizations. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes unspecified medications one is for thyroid, one is for cholesterol and the other 2 are for anxiety. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. Patient&#39;s symptoms started with a headache the morning after the shot (05Apr2021), was on and off for a couple of days, lasted 3 days or so for a couple days and she took paracetamol (TYLENOL). On 09Apr2021, Friday morning, patient woke up so nauseous she couldn&#39;t hold anything down. It was just bile coming up, and she had severe diarrhea and so sick vomiting that wouldn&#39;t stop, stomach pain, couldn&#39;t hold her own weight up. She got medication at a walk in clinic and that didn&#39;t stop it. She started out at acute/urgent care, where she was taken by her daughter on Sunday, 11Apr2021, because she was feeling so bad and was tested for COVID and they said if it does not get better to go to the Emergency Room and she continued having problems. It was not COVID. They said she was dehydrated and send her home to push fluids and drink Pedialyte. Monday or Tuesday (Apr2021) she was in the ER all night (she does not remember the day because all of her days are mixed up). They did CAT scans on her abdomen and ran blood work. They didn&#39;t see anything in her abdomen. Her white blood cell count and kidney and liver function were all elevated and they said it was from being dehydrated from diarrhea and vomiting. They gave her fluids and sent her home. Within another 48 hours she still had vomiting and diarrhea, it was a clear bile and a sharp pain in her side. Her stools were dark tarry stringy stuff so she went back to the ER and waited in the lobby for 9 hours. In that 9 hours as she was waiting, she felt like she had to go to the bathroom. She was then wheeled into the bathroom and started passing blood. It wasn&#39;t coming from the urethra. It must have come form the vagina, she doesn&#39;t have a uterus. There were clots. She started passing blood in her urine but most was in the vaginal area but she has already had a hysterectomy. She was passing clots and her doctor who works in the healthcare field looked at it and said they were clots. Very shortly after, she passed the clot and the pain went away. The pain was passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area at one point went away but she still have nausea and diarrhea and they gave her more fluids and sent her home. They didn&#39;t really want to address the vaginal bleeding. Patient have not been back and was not sure if she is still dehydrated. Patient was still pushing fluids and still not back to normal. Patient&#39;s daughter told her that since it was 5 days later it was not a reaction. Patient was thinking maybe it was an allergic internal severe reaction. Patient was weighing 130 pounds but lost about 4 pounds during this illness, so 4 pounds lighter. She stated her daughter-in-law was doing research and found a blog and there are woman the caller&#39;s age complaining of these symptoms (unexplained bleeding) after the vaccine. She asked if this was from the vaccine. She stated she was so sick that if there is even a chance then she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She asked if this is a coincidence or has it been reported. She stated she is trying to make a decision on if she should get the second dose because she heard other people have symptoms and take the second shot. The outcome of the events passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area, headache, a sharp pain in her side, passing blood in her urine, passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area/vaginal bleeding was recovered on Apr2021, while for the other events, it was unknown.

A 64-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 23Feb2021 at 12:00 (Batch/Lot number: EL9269) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included pain, eye condition, Prediabetes, immunosuppressive - she is also taking immunosuppressive medication that is lowering her immunity: Mycophenolate since Dec2020. She also had a pain in her lower back on about 19Feb2021. Concomitant medications included prednisone (PREDNISONE) taken for eye condition from Aug2020 and ongoing-her immune system is attacking her retina, started a high dose in Aug2020 and has titrated down since then; mycophenolate mofetil (MYCOPHENOLATE) taken for eye condition and immunosuppressive from Dec2020 and ongoing; metformin (METFORMIN) taken for Prediabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing and been on it about 6 years; and gabapentin for pain. The patient developed shingles on 03Mar2021. She is on prednisone, mycophenalate, and pain medications. She wants to know if it&#39;s ok to get the second dose since she is immunosuppressed. The patient was calling about the Covid-19 vaccine and reported that she got the first dose on 23Feb2021 and about 3.5 days later she got a shingles rash. She wanted to know if it is ok to get the second vaccine or if that is contraindicated. The patient said that she is also taking immunosuppressive medication that is lowering her immunity (Mycophenolate) and she has been on it since Dec2020. The patient said that she was on another immunosuppressive medication before this for a month that she had a reaction to. She said that was when she was switched to Mycophenolate. The doctor had her on an antiviral for shingles rash that she started on 03Mar2021. She clarified that it is Valacyclovir HCL 1 pill 3 times a day for 7 days, and she was given pain medicine called Gabapentin 100mg 1 pill 3 times a day by mouth. Her next dose of the Covid-19 Vaccine was scheduled for 16Mar2021. The patient said that the vaccine stung when it went in and the site was tender. Her arm is still a little tender at the site. She said that it seems since she has the shingles stuff it is a little tender. The patient said that she had a pain in her lower back on about 19Feb2021. She went to the doctor on 01Mar2020 because it was not going away. The doctor thought it was a urinary tract infection and gave her an antibiotic that she stopped on 04Mar2021 after being diagnosed with the shingles. The event shingles / shingles rash required a visit to Physician Office; she did a telehealth visit with her doctor for her shingles rash. The event shingles / shingles rash had not resolved while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

Some dr blamed it on the morphine but have had past unconscious hospitalization when sudden withdrawal from gabapentin which resulted from vomiting.  Have never had problem with heart kidneys or lungs before this.   Was given (medication) three times but it didn&#39;t bring me back to normal.  As for level of morphine sudden stoppage of gabapetin CA  affect the levels in blood. I was told not to get the second vaccine but not one dr in hospital seemed to want to report this and I don&#39;t think its right. I am going to have bill from being in intensive care and who knows what this will cost me.

I passed completely out still lying in bed (so out that I wet myself in bed) and gradually came to, still feeling horrible. Got up, changed clothes, and major chills when I returned to bed. Around 6am I felt nauseous, got up to vomit, but instead passed completely out on the bathroom floor for about 15 minutes.  Remainder of day I felt very stiff, low energy and slightly woozy. By afternoon, energy was returning (I vacuumed the house). Minimal pain in arm this time compared to previous.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Mar2021 09:40 (Lot Number: EN6199) (at the age of 65 years old) as single dose (dose 1) for COVID-19 immunisation; and methylprednisolone (MEDROL), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at short term increase of the Medrol dose (as reported), from  unspecified date to an unspecified date at 2 mg (for four years, as reported), then from unspecified date to 10Mar2021 at 6 mg, then from 11Mar2021 to 13Mar2021 at 8 mg, then from 14Mar2021 to unspecified date at 6 mg, for Lupus. Medical history included diagnosed with asthma initially exercised induced and now it is seasonal and was diagnosed years ago (states she has not had to use her Albuterol inhaler that much now because it is seasonal but she is doing more outside and is allergic to outside things so she tends to use the inhaler more if needed), right leg paresthesia (she did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine), autoimmune disorder, thyroid disorder and patient stated that she has lost height. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for asthma; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for thyroid disorder; paracetamol (TYLENOL); and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The patient had a history of Lupus and is on maintenance Medrol 2mg for four years and before that she had a short-term increase of the Medrol dose with flares of her Lupus. She had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 1st dose and then three days later on 10Mar2021 at 16:00, she thought what is going on and had her tongue tip so irritated and a strange feeling that it was a tiny bit edematous, her lower lip was full tingling. She had mucoid eruption on her lower lip and saw then that the next day thought it was swollen but it wasn&#39;t swollen. She had eruption on her tongue, had a rash to her face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and thighs. The rash was dispersed and there is a red raised rash with Lupus called Livedo reticularis and that is usually on the thighs but this rash on her was below her thighs and came up and dispersed between all the same rash elsewhere on her body. The healthcare professionals were closed so she took increased Medrol steroids and her Albuterol inhaler and Benadryl; the Benadryl was thrown out and discarded so she has no lot number to provide for it, stated that the Benadryl was the pediatric dye free bubblegum free. The Albuterol Sulfate HFA inhaler is 90mcg per puff and she does two puffs every 6 hours as needed; she had not taken the inhaler but she has trouble with asthma and took the Albuterol inhaler now as preventative and needs to use the inhaler as of yesterday (lot Y23B with expiry date Dec2021). Patient stated that she has the tools of her Albuterol inhaler, the steroid Medrol and the Benadryl and the knowledge so she prevented the symptoms she was reporting from being life threatening but stated the reported events were a little disabling and medically significant.She had joint pain in her left arm and could not use her left arm and her whole entire arm and hand. She had left clavicle pain under the clavicle and knows this did occur in the random trials but for her it went away after two days and is now back regarding the pain. She has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red. The next morning on 11Mar2021, her upper lip was tingling and she did go see her healthcare professional in town and sent photos to her Rheumatologist. As time went on she had tingling in her hands and her entire body from her scalp to her soles was so irritated and prickly and her soles and palms were bright red; it looked like Kawasaki disease and she used to take care of children with Kawasaki disease. On Saturday which was the 3rd day she was on the Medrol 8mg and had the fight or flight cardiac symptom and she cut herself down on the Medrol on the next Sunday to 6mg which seemed to make her better. The redness was gone until she had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 2nd dose yesterday and the healthcare professional initially said after her 1st dose of the vaccine to wait and see her rheumatologist do decided to do the increased Medrol dose of steroids and she stated she has got to get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; the healthcare professional checked her lungs that were clear and her pulse ox was fine and she was not wheezing and she then went on increased steroids from Medrol 6mg to 8mg right away. She did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine so she knows what it is like because she has issues with her spine but had not had the paresthesia in a long time. She increased to Medrol 8mg for the three days after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and got a flight or fight response. She had to increase the Medrol dose from 6mg and popped it up to 8mg and she had mucoid eruptions in her mouth, on her palate and down her throat and had a voice change. She has a laryngoscopy on Thursday (25Mar2021) with her ENT. She has pediatric doses of everything because she reacts to almost everything. The 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine was administered to her on 29Mar2021 09:45 with lot ER8732. Patient stated that anyone else would have gone to the emergency room but she took care of herself at home and knows the risk factors related to the vaccine. She absolutely felt the reported events were related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine in terms of causality and she never had these issues before. The rheumatologist had experience with patients with autoimmune diseases and stated people with autoimmune disease have a heightened immune reaction to the vaccine no matter which vaccine they get and are overly active and then a vaccine is thrown in there and we are charting new territory. The next Thursday or Friday over a week now after the Pfizer COVID Vaccine she had a multisystem type of thing and on 18th and 19th of March she started having episodes and was not doing anything but quietly doing something and had chest flutters and spontaneous cough where her heart races and felt she couldn&#39;t catch her breath and is now on a 30 day event monitor. She was not sure this is due to the Medrol steroids or the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She got her thyroid TSH level done because sometimes when the Synthroid dose needs to be lowered because it is too high for your body and you can have atrial flutter which she has had before in the past from her Synthroid dose being too high; states her Synthroid is 50mcg and takes it once per day by mouth and it is in a prescription bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC. Patient saw her primary care physician again last Tuesday on 23Mar2021 and all the issues in her throat and neck area had something pressing around her throat and thought it was lymph nodes and woke up with a voice change and physician said he would take a look and he said it was not thrush and she would have to be scoped because he couldn&#39;t see in her throat. She had a referral for a CBC and Chemistry lab to be done on 25Mar2021 and TSH was in the usual range for her, the results from Thursday (25Mar2021) night had her BUN and creatinine and GSR (Glomerular filtration rate) abnormal. The rheumatologist called her that night and talked to the physician and said he considered this may be body inflammatory response to being vaccinated and could be that her kidneys were inflamed and she does not know as this is all new territory. For the kidney issues, the information was sent off to the rheumatologist who did orders and called the physician back the next day and she told him she thought she needed a nephrology consult and had urine chemistry, a urinalysis and looked for protein and did a blood draw for a chemistry screen with the following results on 25Mar2021: BUN 22.3, grade IIIa kidney failure, creatinine 1.28, eGSR-NAA 42ml/min, normal is over 60 and she usually runs 70 something. She went to the hospital over the years to have her chemistry lab done because she has Lupus and over the last two years she has never been below 60 for the eGSR-NAA. On 26Mar2021, she repeated the blood work and sent everything to her physician and the CMP had her BUN still elevated at 19.5, the creatinine was down to 0.97 and the eGSR-NAA was up to 58mL/min which is still abnormal; the urinalysis was all fine with no white cells and no leukocytes and no protein; the urine chemistry had the creatine of 8.5, the protein in the urine LVL was less than 0.4mg. Her CBC had her lymphs and monos down and she would expect having this response to the vaccine. Both physician called her on the weekend and they were concerned this came out of nowhere and now are monitoring her again in a month; her physician and rheumatologist both were entertaining this could be related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She does not take vaccines because of what they do to the body and did take the flu vaccine in Oct2020. She was covid negative (unspecified date) and stated had to be screened on Friday 26Mar2021 before her laryngoscopy and did the PCR test and only does the PCR. States she was doing research and had conflicting information from her physician and rheumatologist who she first saw her physician, after her 1st dose of the vaccine and the rheumatologist talked about increasing her steroids and she told him she was so tired and how with increased steroids, do steroids impact the effectiveness of the covid vaccine being blunt immune suppressants. Physician said long term chronic steroids have no effect on the effectiveness of the vaccine. She has no had headaches, shaky chills like everybody else has because she is on immune suppressants and has an article that says some evidence for steroids diminishing efficacy in Pfizer COVID Vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional Vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Events required a visit to physician office (No visit to the ER but did see her physician). The last action taken in response to the events for methylprednisolone was unknown. The outcome of the event had left clavicle pain under the clavicle was recovered on 12Mar2021; event has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red was recovered in Mar2021; outcome for the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events are assessed as possibly related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 based on strong temporal association, but possible contributory effects from patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications cannot be completely ruled out.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) from a Pfizer-sponsored-program. A 66-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at 65 years old, dose 1, intramuscular, administered in arm right on 29Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EP7533) (time given: 10:30 or 11:00) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient received the first Pfizer COVID shot and she became sick after receiving it. She was supposed to go back on 19Apr2021 for the second dose but she was still recovering then. Patient was asking if she can she still get the second dose. Her right arm got real sore, she could not lift her arm. Then her back started hurting like it settled in lower part of back on right-hand side, she developed a real bad urinary tract infection (UTI) and soreness in legs, she could not even lay on her left side since she was in such pain. She ended up going to urgent care because she was in such pain with her back and arm. They gave her a steroid shot, antibiotic shot and oral antibiotics to take. Patient also experienced headache. She is feeling a lot better. She recovered completely around 26Apr2021. Did not require a visit to emergency room, required a visit to physician office.

Her psych doctor thought maybe the vaccine could have triggered this type of reaction. She gained consciousness and was sent to a rehab nursing home where she&#39;s learning to walk to feed herself and getting stronger now that she&#39;s home. There&#39;s a long road to recovery.

Five days after the vaccination, my stool became very pale (clay color) and stayed this way  for 6 days.  Both conditions resolved on their own.  I was very tired for a couple of days after the vaccination,  had some soreness in the vaccination site and my appetite was off a little for a few days. These were the only other symptoms.

Physician considered 1g Rocephin for UTI, but did not administer due to hives reaction to amoxicillin. Prescribed the patient 5-days of Macrobid PO BID. Discharge diagnoses were lightheadedness and UTI.

A 66-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8729), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Apr2021 at around 09:15-09:30 (at the age of 66-year-old), as 2nd dose, single in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing Tumour Induced Osteomalacia from Jul2019 and had surgery in Feb2021. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021 around 09:15-09:30, as single in left arm for COVID-19 immunization and her arm was just a little sore. Patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included Calcitriol 0.5mcg every morning and every night by mouth and then reduced it to 0.25mcg every morning and every night, taken for calcium. Patient had been going for lab tests every 3 months since Jul2019. On 13Apr2021, after the second dose, the blood work came back all crazy. Patient could not figure out why it went so crazy and the only difference was that she had the vaccine. On 13Apr2021, her tumour marker FBF 23 (Fibroblast growth factor 23) was 899, which was supposed to be under 189, and hers was typically about 365, 348. Patient did not receive FBF 23 test result performed on 10May2021, and she assumed that this would be normal as all other results went back to normal. On 13Apr2021, calcium went up to 10.8, which concerned the doctors, and she went again to physician&#39;s office on 10May2021 to repeat the blood work and everything went back to normal: 9.9, it was usually 9.7 or 9.6. Patient&#39;s glucose was normally 85, 86. On 13Apr2021, glucose was 107 and on 10May2021, it was back to 96. Patient&#39;s phosphorus level was usually very low, but on 13Apr2021, it went up to 3.5, but it was in the normal range. On 13Apr2021, patient&#39;s parathyroid hormone went down and then reached back to 24. Creatine level was 1.1 on 13Apr2021, but on 10May2021, it went down to 0.9 where it belongs and the patient stated that the vaccine might have done something good too. On 13Apr2021, sodium went up to 146, but it was not bad. On 10May2021, it decreased to 144. On 06Apr2021, the patient&#39;s arm was a little sore just where the shot was taken and confirmed that she got this after both vaccines. It was not a whole sore arm, pain was present only on the vaccination spot and pained only on touching it. The clinical outcome of events fibroblast growth factor 23 increased, arm was a little sore just where the shot was, creatinine went down to 0.9 where it belongs / shot did something good too was unknown and clinical outcome of all other events was recovered.

                                                The morning after I got the shot (Wed), I had a sinus headache which got worse throughout the day. As the day progressed I had body aches, was exhausted, got congested and coughed from time to time. I worked every day during the week with this. And later that night, I got severe chills for about 4 hours. I lost my appetite and had to urinate frequently. My headache got worse and my arm was red, itchy, painful and hot to the touch. I felt like I had the flu or maybe even Covid. I woke up every 2 hours during the night with the headache and having to urinate. Finally around 3 AM I decided to take 2 Ibuprophen and the headache was gone when I woke up (Thurs) at 5:30 AM. On Thurs, I was still tired at work, arm was sore and no appetite. But no matter how much water I drank, I hardly urinated. I was still very tired but cough &amp; congestion was just about gone. By Friday I felt a lot better. But my arm is still sore today (Sunday.)

                                                I woke up at 1 am and needed to urinate. I did but then immediately felt the urge to go again but I could only go a small amount. This continued on for every 5 to 10 minute until 2am. My urine was tinged pink and then continued to get worse. By 2am, it was the color of tomato juice with several clots. I went the the emergency room and was given 1 liter of IV solution and an IV antibiotic. I was released around 4am and returned home. I was prescribed a 7 day regimen of oral antibiotics. I did not feel any pain, only the discomfort from the urge to urinate which lasted about 18 hours. By 9am, my urine was clear and in normal amounts. I have never had a UTI in my life which is why I am reporting this.

Late in the day had a splitting headache, i never get headaches, took Tylenol and felt better. At 2 am that night woke up with teeth chattering and limbs shaking. Urinated and noticed a pink tinge. My husband took me to the ER ( He had had a similar reaction to his first Pfizer shot)  Found to have a fever, increased heart rate and a raging bladder infection (significant amount of blood in urine). Treated with Keflex via IV . Went home with a presciption for Keflex  They are running a culture. I HAD COVID IN NOVEMBER AS DID MY HUSBAND   IT APPEARS THAT MAYBE ONE DOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT FOR US. I HOPE THIS WILL BE EVALUATED AND THE PUBLIC INFORMED OF BEST PRACTICE

A 57-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot no. PEL9261, via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 as single dose for prevention of COVID 19 virus. No relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunisation (lot no. batch/lot number: EL1284). The patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 on 15Jan2021. She had a reaction to the vaccine, had a mild reaction with first one she felt like if her heart warmed up and a burning sensation in her left side of the neck and face. She received the injection on her left side. She was kept for half an hour and then she had a mild headache and slept. She also had fever, pain at the injection site and felt very tired. She received the second dose of the vaccine 5 weeks ago. Several days after second dose on Saturday mornings, started having 100.2°F fever for two days and her whole body was aching. When the fever disappeared, she was very tired that week. Her right kidney started aching and then the left kidney, there were also bubbles in her pee and it went worse (no blood in the pee). A few weeks ago, she went to the urgent care, because a week before there were leucocytes in her urine and she took antibiotic. On Monday, she saw the urologist and the urologist sent her a CT scan and a blood test. The blood test results were abnormal so she didn&#39;t have a CT scan done because it could be dangerous. Her creatinine was high and her GFR was 41 (stage 3), she didn&#39;t know her kidney disease stage until they have the results (Monday). She was very healthy, didn&#39;t take drugs and there&#39;s no history of kidney disease in her family, also she exercised every day. She would like to know if something similar has been reported with the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine because she&#39;s trying to understand these symptoms that came from nowhere. She knew the Covid-19 could cause kidney problems. She would like to know if there&#39;s any live virus in the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine. She was normally completely fit and healthy. She did not have any abnormality whatsoever and no big medical history. She had the 2nd Pfizer job about 4-5 weeks ago and in the last 3 or 4 weeks at least, she has been having aching kidney, kind of oily bubbles in her urine and she went to see a doctor, a specialist to send her for some test. Today, she discovered that she got a high creatinine and low GFR so that meant have got at the moment, the picture was stage 3B Kidney disease. She had no family history of that. She never had any problems before. She just wondered whether there was any other case report like vaccine should be toxic to her kidneys. This was so out of the loose. Just so uncharacteristic. She stated that probably more than that, she thinks it started because she did not realize at first, it just made her feel tired, her kidney was aching because she was working too hard. It has developed over, it was hard to say. She had the second shot and she had fever for two days. She was so tired anyways. So, she was not exactly sure whether it began exactly when she had it but she certainly did not have it before or whether it came on a few days after or a week after, she was not sure but she knew that it has got worse and now, she was in a situation where she had a CT scan today (19Mar2021). So, she went to the doctor probably on Monday or Tuesday to find out exactly what was going on but she had absolutely no history of anything like this. She had no family history. She was completely healthy. She normally exercised, aerobic exercise most days. She was a healthcare professional (nutritionist). This had come as a complete shock to her today. She was phoning because she wanted to know if there were any other case reports. She knew it was very early and there was not much research on the vaccine but she did not know whether anybody else had reported having kidney problem. She knew you can get kidney problem with the actual disease, with the virus rather but she did not know if the vaccine could cause that. She knew it had something to do with the vaccine and obviously, it may be temporary and she can deal with it. She just needed tab a little bit insight of what to do next. She was not on her normal weight because she has put on about 5 or 6 pounds in the last few weeks. So, she thinks she had got so much fluid. She was normally 5 foot 5 (inches) and her weight was normally about 130 pounds. Actually, it was less than that so it was 127 or 128 pounds but at the moment she was 134. She had got lots of fluid in her body around her middle. When she had the second shot, she had the fever for two days on the Saturday and Sunday and got really tired on Monday and Tuesday and she went there and felt a little bit better but she cannot remember when her kidney started aching. She did not know if it was immediately or whether it was the next week. It started gradually and it had got worse in the last couple of weeks. So, the ache had got so much worse and the amount of bubbles in her pee and urinary symptoms had got worse in the last, at least probably 2 to 3 weeks or so. She had nothing at all before the second vaccination. She would say that it was shortly after she carried on feeling tired and then her kidney started aching and then she developed urinary symptoms. So, that was within a week to 2 weeks of having the shot. She definitely noticed that she had the symptoms and it may have been sooner. She was not entirely sure. It may have been the same week. She honestly cannot remember because it began gradually and she started to feel like she was getting cystitis and she did not think anything over it and then it got progressively, her kidney started hurting and she got really tired and then she just started having oily bubbles in my pee. When probed for the LOT# of vaccine, the first one looked like as EL1284, and the second one, it looked like PEL9261. It could be 4916. She had got the card but she did not know exactly. It was terrible writing. She was not sure it was hard to read. The first one was in her left shoulder and the second one was in her right shoulder. She felt it was related. It has taken incident from when she had the vaccine. Well, she was obviously not a 100 percent sure that was why she was phoning to ask if there is any other similar case report. When probed for the treatment, she stated no, not yet. She only found out today that what happened was she went to see a neurologist this week and on Monday and they organized her to have a CT scan today and some blood work and when she got to the CT scan center today and they looked at the blood work and they said that her levels were too abnormal to have the CT scan with the contrast dye. It would be dangerous. So, that was when she found out it was an abnormal result. So, it just happened today. So, she had not even seen the results of the scan yet and had not seen the doctor but she just knew that her blood was abnormal and her kidney was not functioning properly and trying to find out whether it was related to the vaccine because she needed to find out how to manage it going forward. She was hoping if it was due to the vaccine she can, it has been toxic stroke to her kidney and then she can workout how to deal with it hopefully reverse the situation but she had no Idea but she was just trying to get the feeling for what this could be. She did not have the results of the CT scan yet. She only got the results of the blood which said her kidney, when she went to have the scan her doctor asked her to have the scan and then to have a second scan to what they call a contrast dye and the technician said that when he looked at her blood results he said she cannot give her the contrast dye it was too dangerous. She needed to phone the doctor and so he phoned the doctor and the doctor said just do the scan without the contrast dye and they told her what the blood results were. So, she looked online and she can see that it was Stage 3B Kidney disease and she was in the stage of shock and she was feeling before she went to have this test that this was related to the vaccine because it has come since she has had the vaccine, so close to her having it so now she was more convinced and she just wanted to see anybody else has had this. Obviously, the doctor would not know about this because this was so new and so she needed to workout on how to deal with what has happened to her. Her creatinine was 2 and GFR was 41. With second one she had the fever for few days and she felt very tired, and then she developed some bladder symptoms, and she thought maybe she just had something like cystitis, and then she was very tired, her kidney started aching and particularly on the right hand side but on the left as well, it&#39;s got worse and worse to point that she got oil bubbles in her pee and she went to see neurologist on Monday, she had the blood test and today she got scan, a CT scan and she meant to have a consult after the scan with the scan but when they saw the blood result, which she has not seen, they said that was so abnormal they could not get her the contrast dye, so they said because of the result, she suddenly got out of nowhere and stage 3B kidney disease, and she had not gotten the result of the scan yet but she has sent in on stay, but she didn&#39;t at all feel well, haven&#39;t felt well since she had the vaccine she personally felt it had something to do with the vaccine because she did not have any family history of kidney disease or anything related to that and she never had an issue, never even had kidney infection so, she phoned up today to off Pfizer whether there have been any other case reports, because she had to go back and see her Urologist now and he won&#39;t know because it&#39;s obviously such early days with the vaccine and there not any proper Clinical Trials to, she would think to reflect this. She was concerned about the side effects and she just wanted to know because now, she knew had to deal with it, and she was, obviously that came as big shock to her that she just wanted to, if there have been any, she knew that the Covid virus can cause kidney disease, but I didn&#39;t know whether the vaccine has been showing to do that in any other individual. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient on 15Mar2021: blood test, result: creatinine 2 and GFR 41. The outcome of fever and tired was recovering, while outcome of other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient is a 68yo female with a PMH s/f of osteoarthritis, CHF, TIA with right limb weakness and aphasia and HTN presenting with a 1 week history of bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, stiffness and weakness. Patient states that she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/14 last week at pharmacy. At the time of inoculation, she did not experience any symptoms and went home after the 15 minute waiting period. The next day, she developed a generalized headache that started in her neck and continued over her head. She states that this continued to get worse throughout the day and on Saturday, she woke up and described a constant, 10/10, dull-aching pain that started at her neck/back of head and extended down to her shoulders to the tips of her fingers. She also stated that she had the same pain starting around her groin extending down to her knees and ankles. Patient initially tried taking Tylenol and ibuprofen to treat the pain, and said that those treatments normally work for her osteoarthritis, but that her pain did not improve afterwards.  In addition to the pain, she also states that she developed worsening weakness to the point where she could not walk around her home. She stated that she thought moving around and being active had helped her fight through the pain and tolerate it, but that laying down and resting actually seemed to make it worse.  With her symptoms worsening and her inability to walk, she decided to come to the hospital to get further treatment. She denied ever having an adverse reaction to other vaccines she has received previously. She receives the flu vaccine every year, and received measles, polio and other childhood vaccinations that she could not recall. She was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica and started on 20mg prednisone daily. She had a remarkable response to the steroids and her symptoms resolved within 24 hours. She was discharged on her 3rd day of admission.   On ROS, she denies fevers, chills, night sweats, SOB, changes to vision, eye pain, cough, chest pain, sputum production, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria or hematuria. She affirmed weight loss, headache, neck stiffness, dizziness, lightheadedness, muscle stiffness/pain, reduced ROM, and urinary urgency and incontinence.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular injection on 20Jan2021 (at the age of 68-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing breast cancer stage IV, patient was in treatment for breast cancer stage IV, she had cancer 13 years prior the report in 2008, and then was found again and diagnosed 3 years prior the report, in Jun2018; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a long time, a lot of her adult life. The patient was on oxygen; she had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer; patient tested positive for COVID in 2020 (Feb2020 or Mar2020, as reported). She and her roommate tested positive and had a cough. They had no fever or other symptoms. Both in the nursing home got over the cough and 21 days later tested negative. Patient tested negative for COVID ever since. The nursing home tested the residents and staff every week. They had tested the patient so much to the point her nose was bloody which the reporter got upset about; hallucinations and paranoid thoughts. Concomitant medications included ongoing perphenazine (TRILAFON) taken for hallucinations and paranoid thoughts; treatment for breast cancer stage IV and oxygen. The patient lived in nursing facility and had received both Pfizer vaccine doses. The patient received the first vaccine for COVID-19 immunisation in Dec2020. She was fine. She got the second one on 20Jan2021. Since patient received the 2nd vaccine dose, in Jan2021, she was having confusion and dementia, which was not an issue before the vaccine doses. The patient was having trouble putting words together. Patient initially had vomiting, nausea and brain fog where she could not concentrate on her TV, in Jan2021. She was hospitalized from 17Feb2021 to 20Feb2021 to have all kinds of tests run and see if her cancer had spread to her brain. Patient had 3 years with stage 4 breast cancer and had fought so hard and was aware of her confusion and it was very upsetting to her. She had days of vomiting and nausea. She complained of brain fog and could not focus on the tv or her programs. Within days, she went into this kind of like dementia-like state where she talked incessantly and could not get a thought completed. Patient would go from one thought to the next. It was very bizarre. She had never had this kind of issues. This went on for so long, they finally put her in the hospital. Patient had stage 4 breast cancer, and the doctors thought maybe her cancer had gone to her brain. The doctor did not think it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was checked for a urinary tract infection (UTI), for brain cancer, for a stoke, for everything. She saw so many doctors. She still had not come out of this a month later. She was currently on psych meds because she had mood swings, since Jan2021. It had been one thing after another. The patient could not tell the time. On some level, patient knew something was wrong. She was in a very confused state. She did not know how to tell anyone what she wanted to tell. It was very distressing to say the least. She had made a little bit of progress. She could tell time with some struggling but she got upset and cried. Patient could only tell that the time was 3, but not 3:15. But, then she cried and got upset. She had been able to tell time a couple of times, but if you asked her what day was it, she had no clue. She had no clue what day it was and would ask &#34;what day is it?&#34; Her moods all over the place. The patient was still very confused. The reporter explained the patient could be 5&#39;3&#39;&#39;, she was unsure. The reporter really did not know the patient weight, she was guessing around 270lbs. She had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer, and reporter had not seen her since COVID started. Patient told that her weight was up around 300lbs. The reporter declined to include a healthcare professional for the report, stating she had not spoken to her sister&#39;s primary care doctor. She was waiting for her to call back. The patient was sent to the ER and admitted into the hospital on 17Feb2021. She came back from the hospital on 20Feb2021 at 6:30pm. She had a CAT scan, MRI, bloodwork done, in Feb2021. She saw a psychiatrist, neurologist, her oncologist. There was so many doctors seeing her and talking to the reporter. The last doctor the patient saw in the hospital said that she thought the patient was dehydrated from her vomiting episodes, but did not know for sure. In Feb2021, the nursing home did blood tests and a urinalysis to see if she had a UTI. The blood work would have shown if patient was dehydrated and she was not. The head nurse thought it was the vaccine, but she was not sure. Everybody was not sure. No one could tell her anything concrete about patient. She was not normally like this. Patient had recovered completely from the nausea and vomiting. They tried for a while to give her an anti-nausea medicine, but she could not keep anything down. It was given to her orally, she did not know why an injection was not given. This lasted for a few days, clarified as maybe 3 days. The reporter had no name, NDC, lot number or expiry date for the anti-nausea medicine the patient took. She knew it was given to her once and when they tried to give it to her again, patient refused. Reporter had no product information to provide for the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, did not have the patient vaccine record card. This would be with the nursing facility. She mentioned patient went into the nursing home on Jan2018 and then was diagnosed with breast cancer Jun2018. She did not know if there were any interactions there with the patient having the breast cancer and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The reporter had no product information for the first dose. When probed for the date in which the first dose was given, she explained she was sent constant emails which could have provided a date, but she did not know this information offhand. It was approximately a month before the second dose, or it could have been on 27Dec2020, which was a little closer than a month apart. No additional vaccines were administered on the same date of the Pfizer vaccine. The events required a visit to emergency room. Patient had constant testing while in the hospital. In the hospital, in Feb2021, they did MRI and CAT scan to see if the breast cancer had gone to the brain and both were negative. They tested for UTI. They did the first UTI test at nursing home in 2021 and they said she had a UTI and patient was put on an antibiotic. They tested her again for a UTI when she was admitted into the hospital in Feb2021 and they said she did not have a UTI. She did have a buildup of urine in her bladder because her kidney functions were not good enough for the MRI at first, in Feb2021. Her bladder was relieved of the urine build up and her kidney functions improved and she was able to get the MRI. The MRI did not show any cancer in the brain. None of it relieved her symptoms. This was just bizarre. It happened within a week of receiving the vaccine. She could not talk with patient and patient had never been like that. The patient had always been lucid and open and you could talk about anything: the past, the present, she had no problems. She could remember everything crystal clear from the past but she could not remember or know everything from the present. The reporter would ask her what day was it and the patient did not know. The patient would absorb the information she was told but there was like this strange disconnect, almost like a dementia of some form. About concomitant medications, the reporter explained the patient had not started anything new. She had been on the same stuff for many years. She had psych meds that she had been on, but she had been on those for many years. She clarified further that patient had been stable on her psych meds for many years, and the nursing facility had the patient stable for 3 years at the nursing home. At the time of the report, her mood swings were all over the place, she had never had that before. She had hallucinations and paranoid thoughts in the past, but she had never had mood swings like this and never had dementia. She had been on the same medications for a long time, but they were currently trying to play with them and trying to adjust her psych meds. It was apparent it was not working and this was something more organic, something going on in her body. The psych med was perphenazine all of her life. The psych nurse was a new nurse and was not familiar with the patient. The psych nurse informed the reporter she raised the perphenazine to the highest dose she could possible go on and told she could have to try the patient on a mood stabilizer and could have to put her in a psych unit. The reporter would not have any NDC, lot numbers or expiration dates, or anything like that. The reporter had been told an UTI could have caused the patient symptoms. It could have been brain cancer, or this or that. She did not know what was going on. Reporter asked if there had been any reports or had other people called in with these types of reactions or adverse events. The patient had recovered from vomiting and nausea on an unknown date in 2021, had recovered from kidney functions were not good enough and UTI in Feb2021, the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                68 yo WF in excellent health with prior history of intermittent benign positional vertigo for seven years and a cerebral concussion two years ago from which she recovered uneventfully in 6 weeks with no residual neurologic or physical issues.  Patient received first dose 1/19/2021 with only mild fatigue and arm soreness at injection site.   16 hours after the second dose, Patient developed a dull total cranial headache and fatigue , retiring to bed , taking no medicines. She had taken only her premarin 0.625 mg for the last week. Patient awoke at 4:30 am with severe headache, nausea and vertigo, being unable to stand without assistance.  urinary incontinence also occurred, but most likely occurred as she was unable to to get to the bathroom due to vertigo and pronounced vomiting of clear yellow fluid.  incontinence never occurred again throughout the illness. examination at this time showed nystagmus on bilateral lateral gaze and vertical nystagmus.  no other neurological signs or symptoms were present. On return to bed, Patient continued to have vertigo headache and nausea even supine with eyes closed.   Vetigo and standing instability did not respond to epley manuvers.  Headache remained mild to moderate, along with persistent vertigo and nystagmus for 4 days, becoming slightly less each day.  On the fifth day, Patient was able to ambulate unaided by holding onto walls furniture etc.  vomiting did hot reoccur after her initial bout. Headache abated on the fifth day.  Patient remained &#34;fuzzy&#34; and imbalanced for the next 14 days with occasional mild posterior cranial headache.  Rotary nystagmus abated on the 7th day.  Note is made that no abnormalities of the tympanic membranes were noted.  no cardiac symptoms or irregularities were noted  HR 60  BP 110/70  several attempts at epley manuvers only resulted in symptom worsening. Patient felt well enough to traveled by airplane day 8 post dose, having still some &#34;fuzziness &#39;and slight imbalance, being unable to walk briskly due to gait instability..symptoms worsened slighty after air flight, and on return to home, slight barotraumatic changes were noted in the tympanic membranes, slight fluid levels and some small streaky membrane hemorrhages noted.  her gait became slighty more unstable, but she was able to walk unaided.   symptoms improved daily and by day  14 symptoms seemed to be much lessened, no nystagmus being noted.  vertigo was present only on rapidly standing , position change and vertical looking up., vertigo abating quickly after each motion at rest.  Patient traveled by plane on 3/4/21-3/8/21, vertigo escalateed to mild to moderate..no response to epley manuvers.   Vertigo worsened daily and Patient again developed mild gait instability and nystagmus bilaterally and vertically.  Ear exam was unchanged.  no headache was present during this time.   Patient was taken for balance training to a specially trained Physical therapist on 3/10/21 for evaluation , Patient being markedly symptomatic, examination showing both right and left ear abnormaities as well as vertical nystagmus.  driving was prohibited. The constellation of symptoms for the even are most consistent with acute vestibular neuronitis or central vertigo..  Neuologic localizing signs suggestive of cerebral thrombosis, etc were not present , so MRI was not performed.  Patient had Had a Notmal CT scan with here cerebral concussion two years prior.   As the symptoms weer worsening and the result of the balance training session on 3/10/21 resulted on significant worsening on awakening on 3/11/21 with moderate gait instability, bilateral horizontal and vertical nystagmus, Prednisone 40MG  po was administered.   Approximately 8 hours after the prednisone dose, Patient was able to stand unaided, and vertigo was almost totally cleared.     30mg prdnisone was administered on 3/12/21 with Patient being totally asymptomatic.  No nystagmus could be detected and epley manuvers done by the physical therapist resulted in no symptons or evoked nystagmus.  Predinsone dose was deescalated by 10 mg daily, Patient remaining totally asymptomatic.   today 3/16/21 Patient will take 5mg of prednisone, still assymptomatic, prednisone to be discontinued tomorrow.

A 68-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for Injection, Lot number and Expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 10:00 (at age of 68 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included omeprazole (PROTONIX). No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. No Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for Injection, Lot number and Expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Feb2021 (at 68 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Caller stated she received Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine and shortly afterwards (on 24Feb2021), her mind would &#39;go off&#39; for a couple of seconds and she would just urinate. She stated, &#34;I never had this issue before. It happened one day, then 2 days later, then 2 days later. My mind would just go off for a second and I would just stand there and urinate. And it went on for 10 days every other day. Now it just happened. I just unloaded yesterday (29Apr2021). It all just started happening after the 2nd vaccine. It may be related or may not. The urologist said that&#39;s strange and they said there&#39;s nothing they can do about it. I will be seeing the neurologist on 07Jun2021.&#34; Caller calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She states that 2 days after getting the second shot every now and then her mind would go off, like a mini seizure and then she would loose her urine. She states that she has never had this issue before. It has been going on for almost over a month now, but it has been going down a little less, but it&#39;s still happening. She is going to a neurologist, but the neurologist can&#39;t see her until June. She is wondering has anyone else had an issue with this? She states she has been to a urologist, but they say they can&#39;t do anything for her and that she needs to see a neurologist. She states that it is very strange. She does state that it is becoming less and less, and it is like every 4 days now. She states she did have a 6 day stretch where she didn&#39;t have any incidence of the mini seizure or loosing her urine. She states she has never had anything happen to her like this, not even close. It happens out of the blue, and she doesn&#39;t even feel the sensation to urinate. She states she could be talking to someone, or in a store talking to someone and her mind goes out for just a second and then she just pees. She states that she is aware of what is going on. Caller states that she doesn&#39;t know what a mini seizure is like and does not know how to describe this event. However, it is usually when she is talking to someone, her mind might go off for a second then she just pees. She states it&#39;s weird. She states that it is usually when she is out, and that it doesn&#39;t happen at home. She states that she doesn&#39;t have the sensation of having to go to the bathroom she just goes. She says it&#39;s weird, nothing like this has ever happened before. She doesn&#39;t have a problem with fizzing out for a couple seconds. Caller states she doesn&#39;t want to use mini-seizure because then that marks her of having epilepsy. She also states that her doctor told her not to describe it as a seizure because they are not sure what it is yet. She wants to use the term fizz out for a min. Fizzing out for a minute: She clarified and states that the last two times this happened she did not fizz out, but she still just peed out of nowhere, without even having a sensation of having to pee. The last time she fizzed out was 10Apr2021. She doesn&#39;t know what to do and she is hoping that it gets figured out. She went four days without anything happening and then she was waiting in line and it just happened. She states she just urinated but doesn&#39;t recall fizzing out. She states it is not every day but every four days now, the urine. She states that it happened after the second vaccine. Dates for loosing urine was 04Mar2021. Physician Office visit for all events (went to the doctor after this happened. She states that the events might of happened before the second vaccine, she is not sure, but she started righting it down shortly after receiving the second vaccine). The outcome of the event loosing urine was not recovered, for other events was unknown.  information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                My second COVID-19 vaccination injection on Friday morning, 2/19/2021 resulted initially (starting on Saturday, the day following the vaccination} in a sore right wrist and a much more painful right arm that steadily grew in intensity and spread rather rapidly into my upper torso.  By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system&#39;s reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.  Still i can no longer stand and perform even the minimal movements to-and-from wheelchair to bed or toilet without substantial physical help (not needed before this exacerbation) from my sole caregiver, my husband.

                                                This is a 70 year old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (anticoagualted on Eliquis), obstructive sleep apnea (uses CPAP), mitral valve regurgitation, remote tobacco use, hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents to the ED for worsening dyspnea, cough, subjective fever, chills and body aches that have been ongoing for the past several days. The patient indicates that her dyspnea is exacerbated with exertion but she denies chest pain, pleuritic chest pain, leg swelling or calf pain.

Of note, the last documented incidence of testing for COVID-19 was performed on 10/31/2020 after the patient was seen at a Clinic after a exposure for a COVID-positive individual. Testing at that time had resulted negative. To her knowledge, she states that she had, in fact, tested positive for COVID-19 in late fall of 2020, but she was not hospitalized. Yesterday (3/26/2021), she was evaluated at a Pharmacy where she was testing for COVID-19 which has since resulted positive. The patient denies any other acute symptoms of illness.

She was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.   Hospital course: The patient was admitted and started on IV Remdesivir.  She was given IV Decadron.  She was given immune support vitamins.  Despite this, her sepsis worsened.  When it became apparent that the patient was not going to recover, her daughter did make her comfort care only and hospice was consulted.  The patient was found to be appropriate for general inpatient hospice and was made comfort care.  Her requirement for morphine and Ativan did slowly rise.  Eventually, the patient did succumb to her respiratory failure.  Time of death was called at 10:00 p.m. on February 15, 2021   Discharge Condition: expired.

                                                The patient initially presented (3/3/21) with headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, malaise. Patient related she was in her normal state of health and only started to feel poorly after she received her second COVID-19 vaccination three days earlier.  She interestingly related that after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination she had significant burning in her stomach that she noted but no other major symptoms and notably did not experience this severe burning in her stomach after the second dose. She denied any chest pain, current dyspnea, productive cough, sore throat, urinary symptoms, sick contacts.  She has no history of C. difficile, no recent antibiotics, no recent spoiled foods, no recent travel, no history of radiation.  She does have a history of GERD and has had gastritis with mild gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and undergone EGD negative for H. pylori infection.  She also has undergone colonoscopies with polyps that have been removed and reported as tubular adenomas.  As her hospitalization progressed, she was diagnosed with Severe Sepsis due to E. Coli bacteremia in setting of liver abscess, Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Transaminitis (which resolved). Patient was appropriately treated for these conditions. Also, her known uncontrolled diabetes was treated. Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake. Difficult to state definitively any relation to COVID-19 vaccination, though may have resulted from associated dehydration.

A 71-years-old non pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 13Jan2021 09:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3248) as [SINGLE DOSE] for covid-19 immunisation; fexofenadine hydrochloride (MUCINEX ALLERGY), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) to an unspecified date, at for nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea; loratadine, pseudoephedrine sulfate (CLARITIN-D), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) to an unspecified date, at for nasal congestion; trimethoprim (TRIMETHOPRIM), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) to an unspecified date, at for urinary tract infection. Medical history included multiple sclerosis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Known allergies: Penicillin, Tetracycline, Topiramate, Iodinated Diagnostic Agents. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. She had other medications in two weeks. No covid prior vaccination. It was reported that they were not sure that it was due to vaccine received on 13Jan2021. Approximately 2 days following vaccine, 15Jan2021, she experienced nasal congestion &amp; runny nose. She took Mucinex for i dose (she had allergies &amp; have taken it many times with no problems) she became very dizzy &amp; clammy. 2 days later the patient experienced nasal congestion and took Claritin D. The dizziness became worse. She stopped it. She had Multiple Sclerosis. She developed symptoms of a urinary infection that she self medicate with Trimethoprim. The patient became increasingly more dizzy so she called her Dr. She went to office because it was increasingly difficult to ambulate due to dizziness. She ordered lab work &amp; a Covid test (post vaccination SARS-COV-2) on 27Jan2021 that was negative. The dizziness was getting better but still present. The patient was due to have her 2nd vaccine Wednesday 03Feb2021. They just wanted to be sure it is safe to proceed. AE resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                71- year old woman with past medical significant for hypertension on 10 mg of Lisinopril daily for many years. She had her first dose of Pfizer vaccine two weeks prior to admission (3/11/21). After her vaccination, patient felt unwell and dizzy in the mornings. She felt persistent fatigue and had a decreased appetite. The week prior to admission she noticed a decrease in her urine output. She denied NSAID use. Her primary care physician ordered blood week and her Cr was found to be 16.54 and BUN of 163, phosphate of 17.5. Her last known Cr prior to her admission was 18 months prior and was 1.17. She was asked to present to the emergency room. Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis or stones. Urinalysis showed 1&#43; protein, spec grav of 1.023 with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 0.09. Urine sediment was unremarkable. Her temperature was 95.6 and her BP was as low as 75/46 and she was put on a low dose of levo. CRP was 202.3. COVID was negative. CK wnl.  ANA &#43; to 1:160 (dsDNA, Smith, RNP, SS-A, SS-B all negative). Blood smear was negative. Cultures were all negative. Echo showed an EF of 68% with trivial pericardial effusion. Patient was oliguric, and then initiated on hemodialysis. Renal biopsy was performed.   The biopsy consists of one fragment which is stained with H&amp;E, PAS, Trichrome, Jones Silver, and HPS stains. Review of all stains reveals 12 glomeruli, one of which is globally sclerotic. The architecture of the kidney is well-preserved. There is  interstitial fibrosis with proportional atrophy involving 10% of the biopsy tissue. There is a focal interstitial infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes involving &lt;5% of the interstitium. The tubules show diffuse acute tubular injury.  Calcium oxalate  crystals are present in seven tubular profiles. The glomeruli show expansion of Bowman&#39;s capsule. The mesangium shows normal cellularity. The vessels show no abnormalities.   IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY:   Frozen sections are stained for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q, kappa, lambda, and fibrinogen. All immunofluorescence stains are negative.   ELECTRON MICROSCOPY:   Specimens are prepared for electron microscopy and semi-thin sections stained with toluidine blue are reviewed prior to thin sectioning for ultrastructural examination. Electron microscopy demonstrates patent capillary loops. The glomerular architecture  demonstrates segmental corrugation of basement membranes with increase in lamina rara interna.  No subepithelial deposits and no intramembranous deposits are identified. The tubules show dilated mitochondria and injury. There is segmental effacement of  foot processes. There are no subendothelial deposits. Mesangial electron dense deposits are not identified.   Patient received three dialysis treatments and Creatinine began to improved down to 1.46 within 8 days.

                                                Patient is a 71-year-old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity who presents with complaint of acute onset shortness of breath.  She reports she was walking around her house earlier when she suddenly became short of breath.  She denies any chest pain, numbness or tingling but states that shortness of breath persisted.  She denies any tobacco, alcohol or drug use and states she has never had any symptoms similar to this before.  Denies any lung disease or heart disease previously.  She does have hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is on metoprolol and rosuvastatin respectively which she reports good compliance.  Denies family history of MI or strokes.  She also denies other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers or lower extremity edema.  In the ED vitals were found to be within normal limits.  EKG was obtained showing diffuse T wave inversions, right bundle branch block, no ST changes, no hypertrophy.  Troponin found to be elevated at 0.137, creatinine elevated at 1.3, BUN 26.  Chest x-ray was within normal limits.  Otherwise lab work was unremarkable.  She was given aspirin and Nitropaste Hospital Course:         Patient was admitted to the medical floor and remained hemodynamically stable throughout her stay. She actually remained asymptomatic and had no further shortness of breath. She was not hypoxic, at no point required supplemental oxygen. Her troponins however continued to uptrend to 0.389. Cardiology consulted, she was medically optimized with increased statin dose, therapeutic lovenox, and aspirin. Original plan was for cardiac catheterization. However, a d-dimer was ordered which returned elevated to 13.7. CTA was performed which revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with large clot burden and concern for right heart strain. Echocardiogram showed mildly dilated and hypokinetic RV with mild diastolic dysfunction with impaired relaxation. She was deemed not to be candidate for EKOS. Troponin elevation was felt to be type II NSTEMI 2/2 PE.  PE was classified as unprovoked as she has no definite risk factors for this: no prior DVT/PE, no family history of clotting disorder, no evidence of malignancy (UTD with cancer screenings and visits PCP q6m for health maintenance), no cell line abnormalities, no prolonged immobility or long trips or surgeries, no trauma, no hormone or steroid therapies or even antidepressants. She is obese, and has mild CKD. She tested negative for COVID-19 by antigen testing. The only identifiable change in her health habits recently was receiving the first COVID-vaccine dose on 3/18. We discharged her with Eliquis with instructions to taper from 10BID to 5BID after 7 days. As she will be on anticoagulation, the benefit will likely outweigh the risk of receiving the second COVID dose.  She will follow up with her PCP and hematology/oncology.

                                                On day of 2nd vaccination,  2/11/21, severe momentary dizziness about an hour after then no reaction until 2/13/21.  Approximately, 8P on 2/13/21, found blood in urine that lasted approximately 3 days.  Towards the end of the episode, saw very small blood clots.  Went to my clinic .  Urine sample confirmed blood in urine, CT Scan showed no abnormalities of kidneys, and Cystoscopy with a Urologist showed bladder to be normal.  Have no history of kidney stones, kidney disease or cancer.  As of today&#39;s date, 4/08/21, no further episode.  Lab worked showed no abnormalities.

                                                3/9 MHN, admitted day after covid vaccine with weakness/SOB. Patient with history of small cell lung cancer metastatic on chemotherapy, COPD, diabetes, Sjogren&#39;s who presents with shortness of breath, confusion, and generalized fatigue as well as fall 1 week ago found to have recurrent pleural effusion, T7 fracture, new metastases, UTI. Shortness of breath: Suspicion is that this is related to malignancy plus effusion.  Shortness of breath markedly improved after removal of Transudative fluid, 470cc obtained on thora 3/10 with cytology negative. Encephalopathy: Daughter notes that she has been more confused.  The patient is off on her timeline of details.  CT shows no evidence of brain metastases nor does recent MRI.  Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient is on 3 L of oxygen at baseline and she is currently at baseline. Generalized weakness: Her neuro exam is nonfocal aside from her confusion of timeline.  CT and MRI have been unremarkable.  I discussed her T7 fracture with spine surgery who recommends CT of entire spine which showed additional metastases.  Patient has no pain and has declined the need for brace. Metastatic small cell lung cancer: Patient admits that she does not like to talk much about the big picture however her daughter at bedside did speak with me outside the room and understands that she may have a poor prognosis.  UTI: With increased frequency/urgency/incontinence.  There is trace leuk esterase on UA.  She has been on ceftriaxone but urine culture showing 80,000 colonies of Enterococcus.  Changed to vancomycin.  I discussed with the microbiology lab who stated that sensitivities would not be available until 3/13.  Discharged with sensitivities pending initially with plan for amoxicillin but given interaction with methotrexate change to Macrobid. Normocytic anemia: Likely related to malignancy and chemotherapy.  No blood loss has been noted.  She received 1 unit RBCs prior to discharge.

                                                Diverticulitis; She was not able to get the second dose because she was still home on antibiotics and wasn&#39;t well.; UTI; she was still in pain; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 72-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 10Mar2021 09:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. She did not have any other vaccinations the same day as her Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine or in the four weeks prior. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 10Mar2021. Her vaccine card was handwritten, she couldn&#39;t really read what was handwritten for the LOT, it could be SNG207, but she was not sure she was reading it right, it also could be 7NG207, she couldn&#39;t read it. Yesterday (18May2021) she got tested for antibodies and had none. She got both the POC rapid and blood test and both were negative. After the first dose she was hospitalized on 29Mar2021 for diverticulitis (in Mar2021) and was given many different antibiotics. She was discharged she thought on 31Mar2021, she was there maybe two days. She said recovery took a while, they had her on long rounds of antibiotics. She thought though that she went for her Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine injection 10Mar2021, then was seen in PRIVACY on 12Mar2021, and she thought she had a UTI and put her on Cipro then two days later she was still in pain (Mar2021) so they put her on Keflex for a week and she was still in pain so she went to another doctor who put her on Amoxicillin, so she had a lot of antibiotics after getting the shot, then she was in the hospital for diverticulitis. Then she was on metronidazole (FLAGYL) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) medications IV while she was in the hospital for diverticulitis, and then she came home on Cipro and Flagyl for four more days, until the night her mouth started to swell so she stopped taking them because she thought she was having a reaction (AER#2021571213). She then took an unknown antibiotic that she only took it for one day before she stopped it, then she got a CAT scan that said she was ok (unknown date). She clarified that for the unknown antibiotic she stopped after she took one pill because she had a reaction and then said she was done. She said all that time she was supposed to get the second dose, while she was in hospital and then was told to wait until she was better. She thought she must have some antibodies, so she got tested and had none. She was checked and tested for some percentage of antibodies since after her first dose it said she should have 70-80% and she was unable to get her second dose. She said that the test said she had no antibodies, it was totally negative, and she would like to know is that normal. She was not able to get the second dose because she was still home on antibiotics and wasn&#39;t well. She is unsure if that sickness was from the shot or not and does not know if she should start her first dose over again at this point (she did not ask a question regarding this). Patient underwent Ig/IgM Rapid POC test and SARS-COV2 Ig anti-spike test and both revealed negative result on 18May2021. Outcome of diverticulitis was not recovered, outcome of other events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Within 4 days of receiving this vaccine she noticed she fell on Monday, February 22 she was able to raise herself up she fell again on Tuesday, February 23 and on Thursday, February 24.  By Friday she could not get up and she presented to hospital where she was noted to have lower extremity weakness.  An MRI has revealed extensive edema of the whole of the spinal cord extending from the cervical region to the sacral area.  She has lost motor function and sensation to the lower extremities as well.  She has not had a bowel movement since Thursday, February 24 and she has had to have a Foley catheter placed because of difficulties passing urine.

                                                Pathology confirmed: OXALATE NEPHROPATHY. Unclear trigger for abrupt onset of AKI requiring initiation of dialysis in this lady with hyperoxaluria. Her hyperoxaluria is thought due to roux-en-y bypass. But unclear why she abruptly had Cr go from 1.2 mg/dl in Dec 2020 to 11 on 3/10/21 with oliguria.  I - her attending hospitalist - am unsure what precipitated the crisis. I&#39;ve attending renal pathology conference which discussed case. Some nephrologist entertained attributing it to Cdiff colitis, but the existing literature for this is very limited and her infection seems to have followed her AKI, rather than preceded it.   Although unlikely, I&#39;ve considered that patient may have existed with supersaturate hyperoxaluric state  that experienced shock to equilibrium after small PEG injection of pfizer vaccine.

                                                Pfizer COVID-19 EUA Vaccine  Pt received first COVID vaccine 2/25/21. Tested positive for COVID late February. Reported to ED 3/5/21 with near syncope. Patient was seen emergency department laying in bed. The patient had a noticeable scalp laceration to posterior parietal area.  After being symptomatic with COVID-19 for a few days, the patient reports getting up at 5:00 a.m. to use the bathroom, feeling lightheaded, then ended up on the floor, she reports sitting on the floor and then hit her head at some point, but was not entirely sure of this timeline.  She states she ended up moving to the living room when she noticed that her head was bleeding a lot and her fiance called 911. She reports a history of syncopal episode in 2001 when she had influenza and apparently the story was much the same as this time, but she actually lost consciousness in 2001. Admitted to observation.    3/7: 73-year-old female recent COVID-19 infection admitted on 03/05/2021 for an episode of syncope probably secondary to bradycardia versus volume depletion.  Paramedic on arrival at home reported bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s but has been normal since admission. The CT angiogram of the chest done at the emergency room showed bilateral infiltrates compatible with recent COVID-19 infection.  No PE.  However patient has no respiratory symptoms and O2 saturation is perfectly normal.  Urinalysis was suggestive of infection and subsequent culture was positive for E coli and it is pansensitive.    She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  She was commenced on IV Rocephin and azithromycin.  The EP cardiologist was consulted and she recommended and echocardiogram and it revealed mild global hypokinesis with LVEF of 45-50% but patient denied any prior history of cardiac problem.   On re-evaluation this morning the vital signs remains normal.  Patient has not had any episode of bradycardia since she presented to the emergency room.  She will be discharged home follow up with the EP cardiologist for further evaluation. Patient does not need outpatient oral antibiotics as IV Rocephin for 3 days should be adequate for uncomplicated UTI.

She underwent R foot debridement and amputation on 4/16/2021. ID team treated with Vanco/Cefepime. On 4/18 afternoon, she developed PEA and coded for about 25min. Since ROSC, she never regained consciousness. This morning, at the beginning of my shift at 7am, she&#39;s on bicarb drip, maxed Levophed 100, Epi 100 drips and full vent. However, she was getting paced and BP stayed in 40s. I discussed with ICU pharmacist and gave her stress dose Solu-cortef. Checked serum cortisol level, turned out to be appropriate later. Lactic acid 22 and bicarb was only 2 despite being on Bicarb drip. I called Shauna/daughter to  inform her about guarded prognosis (imminent death) and asked to bring husband to come see her asap. Before family arrived, she developed another PEA and code blue was called. She was given Epi, bicarb pushes and CPR started immediately. Code blue was unsuccessful. At 8:13am, she was pronounced dead. I called daughter again to notify her of patient&#39;s death. Family arrived around 10am. I met both daughter and husband at bedside and offered emotional support. Chaplain was consulted.

A 73-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP7533), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 07Apr2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included breast cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2 on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 73-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced Sore arm and feeling blah. Clinical course was as follows: She spent 50 years in neurology and neuroscience, she was a crazy RN that did neurology right out of school, she was recommended for that specialty. She is not sure if she had a reaction to the vaccine or if it is just her. Her 2nd dose was last Wednesday, 07Apr2021. She had a sore arm and felt blah. Just like after the 1st shot. On Saturday night (10Apr2021) at 0200, she was awakened with chills, cold sweat, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. She was sick as a dog for 2 days and didn&#39;t eat or drink much of anything. She went to the doctor who sent her to an infusion center. She is down to 5&#39; 2&#34; and weighed too much. She has not been able to lose weight for a couple years. She gained 40 pounds when she turned 50 years old. After the shot, she had a sore arm and felt blah like she did after the first dose, but she thought everyone felt that way. She missed a day of gym class because of her really sore arm. This got better like after a flu shot, it was nothing. This time she had a really sore arm and felt blah after the shot but then on Saturday morning this whole thing started happening. She woke up very restless, was all sweaty, cold, dizzy and was too miserable to try and take her blood pressure. Her blood pressure tends to run low. Her symptoms of the sore arm resolved at 06:00 Saturday (08Apr2021). She had nausea and vomiting and couldn&#39;t eat or drink. That lasted through Monday morning. She had some back pain with this, but she has back pain normally as she is a little old lady. She had a scheduled Oncology appointment Monday, as did her husband. She experienced orthostatic dizziness. She woke up plain dizzy. Her doctor gave her a liter of fluids and it helped her. This was something that needed to be addressed. It was serious. It was all serious. She had nothing left to vomit. She is an old lady with Breast Cancer. Her creatinine level of 1.10 which dropped her GFR of 52, she calculated the GFR using a computer program. This is what lead to the doctor giving her a liter of fluid. She had an appointment scheduled and her doctor sent her to the infusion centers for a liter of D5NS. She was sent home afterwards and encouraged to drink fluids. She also had a CBC and chemistry panel with her blood work. She was worried because her skin was tenting badly, and she couldn&#39;t keep anything down. She was probably dehydrated. Her blood pressure at the doctor&#39;s office was 82/50. She didn&#39;t care that her skin was tenting. She has been drinking a lot of fluids as advised after her liter of fluids at the infusion center. She is interested in researching the MRNA process because it is used it in other things. The way the vaccine was developed, it should have dissipated after 48 hours. She likes to research everything. She and her husband experienced a year from Hell starting in August of last year. All events are considered serious. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatinine: 1.10 and blood pressure measurement: 82/50 on 12Apr2021, blood test, full blood count and investigation with unknown results and glomerular filtration rate: 52 on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events chills and cold sweat was recovered on 12Apr2021, skin tenting and orthostatic dizziness was recovered on 13Apr2021, vomiting and nausea was recovered on 14Apr2021, pain in arm was recovered on 10Apr2021, feeling abnormal was recovered on an unspecified date, while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a temporal association and the known drug safety profile, the reported events are considered possibly related to BNT162B2.

The patient presents with Nausea and vomiting. A 73 year old female with a history of UTI and DM was brought to the ED today due to having nausea and vomiting for the past couple of days. She was administered Zofran by EMS; they checked her BS which was 171. The patient states she has been sick since the eighth of this month, and has had diarrhea, dysuria, and  arm pain. She reports not taking her insulin since February due to her insurance no longer covering her. .  The onset was 3  days ago.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is unknown.  The degree at present is moderate.  The exacerbating factor is none.  The relieving factor is none.  Risk factors consist of diabetes mellitus. Therapy today: emergency medical services.  Associated symptoms: diarrhea.  4/30/21: A 73-year-old female, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 with chronic kidney disease, adrenal insufficiency from renal cell carcinoma and adrenalectomy, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with portal hypertension, esophageal varices, has had nausea and vomiting for several days.  She did receive her second COVID-19 vaccination on April 8, and has had ongoing symptoms since that time, much worse in the 3 days prior to admission. An initial COVID screen was negative, but rechecking the PCR COVID test was positive.  Initially, she did not require any oxygen, but did require 2 L nasal cannula at night on the second night, at which time remdesivir and convalescent plasma were administered.  She was also given dexamethasone, but had marked rise in her blood sugar to greater than 400. The dexamethasone was tapered and stopped.  Glucose regulated with insulin.  The patient initially had severe anorexia, poor oral intake, but this slowly improved.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis has shown the small nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.  There is some ascites and mild pleural effusions.  The patient had been receiving some IV fluids, and we would discontinue the Lasix because of low blood pressure.  There was no other obvious explanation for her poor oral intake or abdominal pain. The patient had IV access problems and eventually, despite the PICC line and midlines being attempted, we were unable to complete a successful IV to finish her CAP antibiotics or the remdesivir. The patient seemed to be doing better, oxygen is 98% on room air, blood pressure 98/63 and 116/60.  We are holding the Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone.  The glucose has been running at 213, 154, and 202.  BUN at 35, creatinine 1.4.  WBC 11,700 and hemoglobin 11.5. The patient was seen on the day of discharge at 1100 hours, doing quite well, and will be discharged home with her family.  We have offered visiting nurses, but she feels that the family is there 24 hours a day.  She does not need any visiting nurses.  We have made some changes to her medications, and she will need to follow up with her primary doctor in the next week to see whether we need to restart Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Will be hydrocortisone 15 mg a.m., 5 mg evening, venlafaxine 37.5 daily, venlafaxine 150 mg at bedtime, rifaximin 550 mg b.i.d., Bactrim DS 1 daily, multivitamins daily, insulin glargine 35 units at bedtime, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, NovoLog 20 units before meals.  Again, we are holding Lasix, potassium, and spironolactone.

The initial episode lasted approximately 4 hours. These episodes repeated for the next 3 days. She was taken to the Emergency Room by ambulance 3 days after the vaccine and a workup was completed. It was negative at the time of exam. She did have a mild anemia, but CT and laboratory work were otherwise negative. She had recovered strength and her memory. Later that evening she was again unresponsive except to painful stimuli and was like that over night. She was fatigued but was repulsive the next day. She never gained her full strength back. Over the next 4 weeks, she had progressively more of the periods of unresponsiveness and amnesia that stayed progressively longer and recovery was even less in-between the periods of unresponsiveness. She was placed on Hospice Care and succumbed on March 9, 2021, 1 month after her first vaccine.

Her nephrologist noted worsening renal function and had her admitted for hemodialysis. Of note, she had not been able to keep her appointment for mAB due to weakness. At the outlying hospital she had a palliative consult and started dialysis. First day of RRT was 4/24/21. Approximately one hour after dialysis she developed 10/10 CP and her EKG changed from a partial LBBB to a complete LBBB. She was transferred to a different Hospital for further evaluation. Her BP was fairly labile and troponins were positive. Approx 7 hours after arrival, she became unresponsive. Heart rate was very irregular in what appeared to be a fib. Transcutaneous pacing was initiated. She was given several amps of bicarb and started on a dopamine infusion. Her daughter arrived shortly thereafter and the pt became apneic.

                                                She received her 2nd vaccine and started feeling very chilled and tired around 6:30 that evening, started shaking and feeling like restlessness.  She went to bed and covered up under lots of covers, and just froze.  She put on extra clothes, layers of blankets and her legs felt swollen, painful.  She kept having to urinate a lot, could not sleep, was awake all night, her arm started hurting as well, could not lay on that side, and then started getting cold/hot flashes.  She felt as though her heart was racing, and her brain as well trying to figure out what was happening.  Her husband took her temperature in the morning and it was 101.9, which her normal is 97.9.  At that point she was exhausted from being up all night, and was frightening and couldn&#39;t stop trembling all night long into Saturday.  When day broke on Saturday shew as not able to get out of bed for the entire day.  She could not eat, had no appetite and drank water day.  On Sunday she felt a little better, ate breakfast and the rest of the day went okay other than being exhausted.  This morning, 3/22/21, she still feels lofty, is able to function and feels a little removed/foggy feeling.   She is still not feeling completely well, but is on her way.  Not steady on her feet yet.   She took some Bayer aspirin for the symptoms.

On 01/28/2021 pt started feeling chills, which resolved in 2-3 weeks. Pt started feeling back pain around 02/15/2021, went to Clinic  around 02/17/2021 for the pain. The 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine was due on 02/17/2021, pt had to cancel 2nd dose appointment due to Clinic appointment. Clinic staff told pt back pain was most likely due to a pinched nerve or lower back problems that comes with age. No x-rays or blood work was performed at Clinic. On 02/21/2021 pt stood up and felt even worse lower back pain, couldn&#39;t walk, pt went to  ER and was admitted for 5 days, discharged 02/26/2021. Blood work was done and showed hyperkalemia, proteinuria, and kidney failure, upon discharge ER staff told pt to follow up with nephrologist. Nephrologist appointment is scheduled for 04/01/2021. Pt takes Morphine sulfate IR 15mg, Atenolol 50 mg, Fenosteride 5 mg, and Terazosin 10 mg. Pt has Myeloma, Hypertension, and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Caller denies pt has any allergies. Pt will receive oncology treatment 03/29/2021, the oncologist alerted the caller the 2nd dose must be administered to the pt before oncologic treatment. Caller asked if the pt should get the second dose due to the kidney failure occurring after the 1st dose was administered. Currently pt is only experiencing lower back pain. Pt was advised that it is unlikely the vaccine caused kidney failure and the pt should get the second dose as soon as possible. SPI was consulted and Dr. was notified.

A 75-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1686), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 15:45 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Leighten Plantar Alopecia (hair follicle is an enemy), skin infection (infection in body most of the time, at least on skin), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, obesity, autoimmune disorder (diagnosed 8 months ago). She has lost some height, prior to taking the vaccine and she said it was related to age. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced feeling unwell on 10Jan2021; blood in urine on 10Jan2021 at 17:00; nausea at 10:00, chills at 11:00, almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office at 10:00, felt cold - all on 11Jan2021; getting really tired/fatigue on 14Jan2021 at 09:30; gets really sweaty on 13Jan2021 at 10:00; and dizziness on unknown date. The patient had the first shot on Friday (08Jan2021). On Sunday (10Jan2021), she started feeling bad. She was feeling good about getting it and had no reaction. She has an autoimmune disorder that made her a little afraid to take, but with all the indications, they said it would be much better for her to take it than to get the COVID virus. Sunday (10Jan2021), she does not feel good. So, she started having blood in urine. She thought she had a UTI and had not had one in 20 years. It felt like that is what she had and with the blood in urine. She just took Tylenol and waited until Monday morning because she does not like sitting in doctor&#39;s office. They gave her a cup to give sample and said she didn&#39;t need to see provider. They will have it checked and in the meantime call in a prescription. It kept getting worse and worse. She was about to passed out in the doctor&#39;s office on 11Jan2021, she got nauseous and almost threw up. She got in the car with her husband and he was trying to get her home. She got chills and got so cold and could not warm her body up. Her husband gave her Phenergan and it kind of knocked her out for a while to ease her nausea. She was thinking of going later today (14Jan2021), when she gets enough energy, to get a COVID test. She does not know if it will give false positive or not. She had chills and now she gets sweaty since 13Jan2021. She took her temperature and she did not have one. She just now got up. It is 10:00. She got up this morning (14Jan2021) and was really tired. She was not sweating this morning. Tiredness is kind of new, and when she talked to the nurse, she sort of felt like maybe it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine, but then she talked to her daughter and she said the symptoms she was having are usually symptoms that occur with second dose of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for people to have symptoms she was having. She wanted to know if she should have a COVID test. If she has had just one shot, would the test give a false positive coming from the COVID. They were asking if patient should take the second dose, and should she continue her UTI medication. Doctor&#39;s visit to give urine sample on 11Jan2021 (results: negative for UTI). She did not see a doctor though. They sent sample and prescribed a sulfa based medication for a UTI. She did start feeling a little better and stopped having blood in her urine. She plans to continue it because she does not like to stop taking an antibiotic. She did not have any clue that it was not a UTI until the nurse from her provider&#39;s office called to tell her results of urine sample was negative. Outcome of event getting really tired/fatigue was not recovered; events almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office, blood in urine, chills, and gets really sweaty was recovering; and unknown for other events.

                                                Patient presented on 1/24 with acute onset weakness and numbness of the left leg so a stroke alert was activated. NIHSS 3. Head Ct and CTA head/neck were unremarkable. Not a candidate for tPA given on Eliquis. Initial exam was notable for weakness and sensory loss in the left leg, but a sensory level was also found to the umbilicus raising concern for a myelitis. Of note, the patient also reported that certain red colored things she looked at appeared black. Labs unrevealing- CBC, CMP unremarkable. ESR, CRP normal. UA and UCx positive for E. Coli UTI, she was treated with ceftriaxone. MRIs were done of her brain, cervical and thoracic spine which were unrevealing. On 1/25, her exam worsened including worsening weakness in the left leg and new numbness and paresthesias in the right leg. Reflexes were preserved. MRI L spine was done which was unrevealing. Lumbar puncture was done which showed 2 nucleated cells and mildly elevated protein at 50, but was otherwise unrevealing. IgG Index normal. No oligoclonal bands. She developed mild hyperreflexia in the left leg and continued to have a sensory level, now at around T5-6. Repeat imaging of her cervical and thoracic spine were completed on 1/28 which showed a contrast enhancing hyperintensity at T5. The patient was diagnosed with myelitis and she was started on IV methylprednisolone x5 days and sent to rehab. Patient is now significantly improved though continues to report some numbness in the left leg.
