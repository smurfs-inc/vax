No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Stated that she had a urinary tract infection and was put on antibiotics for 7 days. Two days after starting the medication, she came down with a rash. The patient husband, who was a family physician had never seen a rash like that in his 40 years of practice. In the newspaper, there was a woman who got the vaccination, but not sure if it was Pfizer, and had a rash; the article had a picture of the rash the woman had, after the vaccine. Patient stated that her rash looked worse than the woman in the newspaper. The rash happened after the second vaccine, several weeks later, but after the antibiotics. Patient was allergic to a lot of antibiotics. She stated she may have this problem, the rash because she was allergic to a lot of antibiotics.

Patient experienced the rash was painful on 17Mar2021 and she could feel when another one would start happening. Patient put ice on it to sop the pain and moved the ice packs around as it was reactive to pressure. Stated if there was anything tight, like underwear, or sitting on the couch, she would get welts and lumps, initially mentioned the top of her head. Reclarified itchy in later part of report. Patient got a prescription for her medication on 17Mar2021 and took it for 7 days, and then the rash happened a couple of days after she stopped the medication.

Stated she should have gone to the emergency room, but the doctor, in the Urgent are gave her a Prednisone shot. The only reason she didn&#39;t go because of the Covid, pandemic, so she went to the Urgent Care. The last medication that she took for the rash was an antihistamine on 12Apr2021, and last Prednisone pill was 10Apr2021; both pills were effective in treating the rash. Patient had a Zoom call with an allergist, and the doctor saw the rash with the help of a flashlight and altered the Prednisone dose. Patient had pain under breastbone that it was really bad and the day before she went, to the Urgent Care on the 28th or 29Mar2021, may in the early afternoon. Stated it was going on the whole time, intermittently, not constant in the last few weeks. She didn&#39;t know what was causing it as she had blood work to rule out gallbladder issues and that was not back to rule out a Shellfish allergy. Patient had welts and it all blends in from when she first noticed the rash a couple of days before she went to the Urgent Care. Answered as they were faded out, it was severe, then acute, then extreme for a week or more, and improved with steroids and then faded. Patient had lumps and it started two days before she went to the Urgent Care. Stated when she was sitting on the couch, reclarified, the cords of the pillow put pressure on the areas and it hurt and felt like welts. When she pushed on her skin, here were lumps in her skin underneath, and they hurt and were hot. Described the areas of the lump as buttocks, top of head, legs, arms, groin, underwear line, ear, ear lobe and face. Patient had swelling of lips, and they looked like she had Botox. Also reported additional swelling of arms, hands, fingers, arm from the wrist up to elbow, left foot, left kneecap, left thigh, and her feet swelled up like a balloon. It was better now. Patient had fingertips felt tingley. The palm of hand that patient got rashes in response to pressure and was trying to open a bottle. When she did she got a rash on her palm, a red circle and her hand was hot and itchy. Started as two days before she went to the Urgent Care. Stated she was tired and exhausted from not sleeping and the redness faded away and then it went away a couple of days ago with the help of the steroids. Patient had toes, feel puffy that described as the feeling when she goes to the dentist after she gets Novocain, the feeling. Patient had tired and exhausted. Stated she was tired the first few days until the rash peaked, as she was up all night for two nights icing the rash. Stated she was better but was not doing too much and didn&#39;t get out of the house, only when she had to. Lab data included on unspecified dates the blood work for urinary tract infection was negative; negative results for two Covid tests, one was a blood test and one was a nose swab; blood work to rule out gallbladder issues and that was not back to rule out a shellfish allergy. No events required a visit to emergency room or physician office, but patient went to Urgent Care and had a Telehealth appointment. The outcome of events &#34;Rash; Welts; Swelling&#34; was recovering, while of the other events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                She had been in her usual state of health until tonight. Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL1283, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 19Jan2021 (at the age of 78-years-old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included mastectomy (she had a mastectomy before, so she has no lymph nodes, she doesn&#39;t let them touch her left arm. She says this was done 26 years ago when she was 52), arthritis (she has bad arthritis in her back), Blood pressure high (she takes a high blood pressure medication), High cholesterol (she takes a high cholesterol medication) and eye surgeries (she has had all kinds of eye surgeries before this). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced swelling on her right ear, symptoms of the flu/side effects like the flu, diarrhea/bad diarrhea, urinating like crazy/had to urinate non-stop, sick, swelling on her right eyelid, pain down her neck, everything was swollen, her one eyelid and the outside of her ear then down her neck on the right side on an unspecified date in 2021. The patient stated that she had a lot of side effects and she talked to her doctor who said to go ahead and get the second dose. She says she had no fever, but had all the rest of the side effects, such as swelling of her neck, ear, and eye, which all went away fast. She says she was sick almost 4 days, and her doctor said side effects shouldn&#39;t last that long, so she called to get advice about whether to get second shot or not. She says her appointment for her second shot is the 09Feb2021, she would like to know if it is safe for her to get. She says her side effects started in the evening, the swelling of her right ear didn&#39;t last, it went away. She says during the night she woke up and had to urinate non-stop that started that night a day later. She says that lasted the next day, then the day after, until Saturday she felt better. She says she had all side effects like the flu, then later bad diarrhea too. She says she finally took something for diarrhea (no further information provided about this) and took Tylenol. she doesn&#39;t see the expiration on that bottle, she thinks it is good for 2021. She says that she doesn&#39;t see too good. She clarifies that they Tylenol she had took before, with no issues, and her not seeing too good had nothing do with the vaccine, she has had all kinds of eye surgeries before this. She says her right ear was swollen, everything was swollen, her one eyelid and the outside of her ear then down her neck on the right side. She says that the pain started about a day later Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Caller says that she called her doctor today, that was the first time she did that, she was trying to wait and see, and her doctor said normally side effects don&#39;t last that long, so he has her worried. She says if she does not take the vaccine she will not be protected, but if she does, she may have worse side effects. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of diarrhea/bad diarrhea. The patient recovered from the event swelling on her right ear on an unspecified date in 2021, outcome of the event Urinating like crazy/had to urinate non-stop was recovering, while outcome of other events was unknown.

This consumer reported same events for two patients (one is patient self). This is the first of two reports. This 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration to right arm on 13Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfas, Penicilins, and Avelox, Sulfa or Penicillin allergies since she was a child and had the Avelox allergies about 15-16 years ago. None concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. Did get the original Shingles vaccine about 3 years ago and then they came out with the new one and she got the first dose of that and believes she had a reaction to that one, thinks it was a rash. Also had the flu shot and she usually gets sick with it, but didn&#39;t with this last one. Thinks her body is just delicate. No vaccines administered on same date. Patient had the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on 13Jan2021 15:00 and she was fine. She had a reaction the following day (on 14Jan2021). At 11am the next day she got very dizzy and felt like she was going to faint, pass out at any second. Used cold compresses and drank water and took deep breaths, but she didn&#39;t pass out. She had a funny taste in her mouth. Then from that time until about 7pm she had urine issues and kept going to the bathroom to urinate and had diarrhea and upset stomach. Patient felt like she was out of her body, felt very weird, strange. Doctor stated she maybe had a reaction to the vaccine and recommended for her to take Tylenol. She didn&#39;t take it until right before going to bed. She was able to sleep on 14th night. Woke up the next morning and was fine. She didn&#39;t see any of these reactions listed and that happened. Patient explained to a friend of the reactions and the friend mentions that she also had a friend who had the vaccine and had the same exact reactions, everything. Everything improved and stopped the next morning she was fine, on the 15th. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. The events outcome was recovered on 15Jan2021. It was just a span of time and she has to assume that it was the vaccine since she has never had that before. Patient does not know if she should blame the vaccine because she also has a lot of allergies to a lot of antibiotics and does not know what caused her reactions.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021065869 Same reporter/ vaccine/ AEs, different patient

The patient basically is maintained in the nursing home in this state of being bed-bound and nonverbal.  She was recently transferred to Rehab after she developed a stage IV sacral ulcer at a previous nursing home.  The patient had been seeing wound care and doing very well.  Her stage IV sacral ulcer had been healed to a stage II.  She had been gaining weight.  Unfortunately, at her wound care appointment yesterday the wound had decompensated a little bit and had started to drain some purulent material.  It also enlarged in size a little bit.  I was called yesterday afternoon and the nursing home reported the patient was not wanting to eat or drink.  Lab work showed a sodium of 170 and creatinine consistent with acute kidney injury.  She also appeared to have a urinary tract infection.  Because of her critical labs she was sent to the nursing home.  The patient was evaluated in the nursing home and then admitted to the floor.  She was given Zosyn and vancomycin and started on IV fluids.  The emergency room physician did counsel the family that the prognosis was very grim.  The patient has done reasonably well overnight.  She has been grimacing quite a bit and the family has decided they just want her kept comfortable    comfort care during admission

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; manufacturer reported as Pfizer-Wyeth; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 21Jan2021 12:30 at 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis in back; always had diarrhea because she had cancer and is unable to control her bowels. They tell her she has a lot of fiber in her food; but she can&#39;t control it; if she eats vegetables then she knows what&#39;s happening; but she always tries to take Imodium A-D before eating vegetables. She mentioned to them if she did not eat vegetables all she could eat is meat and cheese; doctor told her she was borderline diabetic, so she has wanted to keep up with that. The doctor was not worried about it; ongoing acid reflux; pain; and ongoing high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for acid reflux, ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure, naproxen for arthritis in back, caffeine, codeine phosphate, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE) for pain, loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM A-D) for diarrhea. The patient has not received any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the covid-19 vaccine. Vaccinations reported as she has gotten flu shots and pneumonia shot and has never had any adverse events, reactions or problems with those; nothing. The reporter mentioned that she got her first dose of the vaccine in a clinic on 21Jan2021 and aware that the second dose will be on 16Feb2021. The patient reported that she felt bad after taking the first dose-flu like symptoms on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and had high fever Saturday (23Jan2021), urine became yellowish-brown and wants to know more information. The patient guesses she is having an allergic reaction on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and asked for further information about the allergic reaction relative to the vaccine. On Saturday (23Jan2021), she was feeling good. She got up, went to store, came back and had little diarrhea symptoms then she began to get sick, feverish. She added that then the vomiting, then achy like flu symptoms. She still feels feverish, she has a really bitter taste, or no taste in her mouth really but it&#39;s going away. To her it seems like the worst part is over. She almost called 911 but then did not want to go the hospital because of all the people with COVID in the hospital. The next day on 24Jan2021, when she woke up, she was not as fevered. She can check her own self with her hand and it was like she put her hand on a stove. She went to sleep and the next morning (24Jan2021), she was not as feverish; her mouth still has that nasty, old bitter taste that does not go away with brushed teeth. She feels better today (unspecified date). She mentioned that the second dose is scheduled to be administered 16Feb2021, but she really does not want to go get that if she feels like this. She had blood work for her sugar done on 21Jan2021 because she is borderline diabetic, but results are unknown, have not had any results yet. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Patient also reports that she has cough, low oxygen and recently received her second Covid shot and when EMS picked her up she was 83% oxygen saturation on room air.  Patient has what sounds like pooling secretions in her throat and patient had suctioning done by respiratory which caused her to bleed blood noted in teeth and around mouth.  Patient reports that her throat has been hurting her and that is why she has been unable to eat.  Patient&#39;s daughter is at bedside and is historian for majority of the assessment.  Patient&#39;s daughter reports she has not been eating or drinking for the last 2 days. Labs in ER showed WBC 11.61, lactate level 3.3, creatinine 2.0, procalcitonin 5.33, magnesium 1.5, BNP 2100, glucose 474.  Chest x-ray showed no acute findings.

                                                4/10/21 ER HPI: 82 y.o. female who presents to the Emergency Department by paramedics from a local nursing home.  The patient is an 82-year-old female with a known history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.  She presented to the emergency room after being transported from a local nursing home.  Apparently, the patient was acting a little bit more confused than normal and she was looking more short of breath than normal.  The nursing home nurse stated that her oxygen saturations were in the upper 80s without oxygen and the patient looked visibly more short of breath than normal.  Because of this, the nursing home made the decision to send the patient in.  When paramedics arrived at the nursing home they placed 2 L of oxygen on her and her oxygen saturations went up into the high 90s.  The patient does dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She did not miss a dialysis treatment this week.  The patient has had her coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and several months ago did have coronavirus (COVID-19) at the local nursing home.  The patient does have mild dementia and so is somewhat of an unreliable historian.  Transferred to pleural effusion

An 83-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 24Feb2021, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included mild asthma, dementia (moments like putting things in the wrong place and being forgetful) and was confused. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) received at age 83 years, on 03Feb2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. On 24Feb2021, after the second vaccinations, the patient&#39;s arm was sore. On 06Mar2021, the patient began just feeling bad, was having like a terrible time, having a hard time, was really not feeling good; was more confused; lethargic; had trouble getting her up, was having to do everything for her, feed her, bathe her; couldn&#39;t walk and lost her appetite. On 09Mar2021, the patient was shutting down. On the same day at 18:30, the patient had gone in the bathroom and said it burned when she peed. So, the patient was taken to urgent care so it would not get out of hand. At the urgent care, they said she has a UTI, there was blood in her urine so they gave her Cipro but they cultured her urine and it grew no bacteria but there was still blood in her urine and she was getting worse with sleeping and she didn&#39;t even get up to eat. The patient was also dehydrated and her urine was dark. The events dehydrated, urine was dark, it burned when she peed, blood in her urine required emergency visit on 16Mar2021.

They did a CT scan of the head and chest to look for stroke or seizure and there was nothing. They blamed it on her dementia that had suddenly progressed. The patient was hospitalized from 16Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. On 12Mar2021, the patient experienced cellulitis in her arm. The reporter clarified that the cellulitis was further down her arm, around her wrist hand area. Her wrist was huge, hot, red, and her hand was swollen. On 24Mar2021, the patient followed up with the family doctor because the hospital wanted her to follow up with a GYN because they didn&#39;t feel it was urinary at all. When the reporter took the patient in to see the doctor, she couldn&#39;t walk in, she had to roll her in a wheelchair, she had stopped talking again. On 26Mar2021, the doctor sent the patient to the emergency room (unspecified reason) and they kept her. They said her said lactic acid was high. She was admitted on 26Mar2021 and discharged on 29Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s potassium was 3.3 and her lactic acid level was back to 2.

                                                Patient was brought in by ambulance on 01/28/2021 with complaints of fever, chills, myalgias, shakiness, and severe hypotension. Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.  Patient was admitted to medical inpatient as it is deemed that she will need longer than a 2 midnight stay for cardiac monitoring and will work with physical therapy and occupational therapy for gait training and strengthening with relation to the compression fracture of her L2 fracture, and pain control.

Around 3/2/2021, she saw her physician complaining of pain in her arm, which was attributed to gout.  At the time, she also had a nonproductive cough, generalized weakness and one episode of loose stool.  She presented to the emergency room on 3/7/21 with significant hypoxia.  She tested positive for COVID 19 by both rapid test and PCR.  A quantitative test for COVID antibodies was sent out to a reference lab on 3/7/2021 and resulted on 3/11/2021 as &gt;250 U/mL.  Pt. required CPAP, BiPAP, High Flow Oxygen and ultimately intubation.  Was not oxygen dependent before hospitalization. Pt. treated with dexamethasone, 2 doses of Remdesivir (then held due to acute kidney injury), tocilizumab X 1 dose, 1 unit COVID-19 convalescent plasma.  Pt. expired on 3/19/2021.

An 85-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021, 11:00 am as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, stroke, heart attack, COVID-19 in Aug2020 (actually had COVID this summer in August, had the mild case), and emergency surgery in Aug2020. Concomitant medications included ajmaline (CARDIA), isosorbide, and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for cardiac disorder; and losartan. The patient her first dose on 04Feb2021 and experienced headaches, muscle aches and pains, chills, other flu-like symptoms, heart conditions, and sensitivity to eggs. She mentioned that this was normal and nothing unusual. She received her second dose on 25Feb2021 at 11:00 am. She was still kind of stiff but was okay. The next day on 26Feb2021 at 11:00 am, she noticed bright red bleeding in her urine when she emptied her bladder. After a few hours it faded. On the next day on 27Feb2021, she experienced the bright red bleeding in the urine again. The red blood did not hurt and patient was achy and headachy, &#34;you know muscles.&#34; So, that kind of happened and it just kind of eased off. She slept a lot because she felt tired and so rotten from Friday, Saturday, Sunday after getting the shot. She also had a mild low-grade fever, headaches, and body aches and pains which she considered normal. Patient was hard of hearing and did not have a bright red bleeding, just had a taint little bit till the day when she got it and then the next day, she went to the bathroom to empty her bladder again and had bright red bleeding again with some blood clots in it. Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Patient received the injection on May 2nd.  Following the injection, we noticed an increased weakness and general achiness.  On the  8th she was so weak that we purchased a gait belt to assist her.  We were not super concerned as we were expecting the second shot to cause body aches or flu like symptoms based on what we had heard from others who had received both vaccine shots.  She continued to be unsteady and we found that she has a mild UTI which we had begun treating with prescribed antibiotics. Late afternoon on the 11th, mother suffered a major stroke.  we did not take her to the hospital because we had already been told that they would not be able to do anything at her age should she suffer a stroke.  On the 12th I called the doctors office and asked for them to send Hospice to the house as we could tell that she was dying.  Mother died on the 13th.    Just a week prior to her death I had spoken with Dr. and we had discussed how that she was declining in health but that she was not even close to needing Hospice, yet she is dead a week later.  Less than 2 weeks after getting her second Covid Shot.

A 88-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021,single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included chronic kidney disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing , atrial fibrillation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing , pulmonary hypertension, allergies to medications, food, or other products: clindamycin, levofloxacin, sulfa drugs, penicillin from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient started having fatigue immediately after 2nd dose vaccination. 3 days later (27Mar2021), patient had very poor appetite, abdominal pain and started having confusion. 6 days later (30Mar2021), patient was hospitalized for acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure. Events resulted in going to the emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse event was IV rehydration, levophed, vasopressin, dobutamine, cefepime and flagyl. The outcome of the events was unknown. No COVID prior vaccination. Patient had COVID test post vaccination (nasal swab) on 31Mar2021 with result of negative.  No follow-up attempts are possible.; Sender&#39;s Comments: By close temporal relationship, the company cannot completely exclude a contributory role of BNT162b2 in the development of the reported diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure. Medical history including  chronic kidney disease in the setting of elderly age, cannot be also excluded as confounding factors.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.
