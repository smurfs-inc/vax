A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 (Lot number: EL9262; Expiration date: 31May2021) on the left arm at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included AFib from 2009 and ongoing; allergies to antibiotics and Penicillin; shellfish allergy. No family medical history. Concomitant medications included nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals; Manufacturer: Alvogen Inc) from 17Mar2021 to 24Mar2021 for urinary tract infection; prednisolone from 10Apr2021 to 10Apr2021 for rash; chlorphenamine maleate (ANTIHISTAMIN) from 12Apr2021 for rash; and taking unspecified medications for a long time.

Patient previously also had something else 10 years ago that didn&#39;t work, it was not a vaccination; took doxycycline hydrochloride (DOXYCILLIN) and amoxicillin that both experienced allergies. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Stated that she had a urinary tract infection and was put on antibiotics for 7 days. Two days after starting the medication, she came down with a rash. The patient husband, who was a family physician had never seen a rash like that in his 40 years of practice. In the newspaper, there was a woman who got the vaccination, but not sure if it was Pfizer, and had a rash; the article had a picture of the rash the woman had, after the vaccine. Patient stated that her rash looked worse than the woman in the newspaper. The rash happened after the second vaccine, several weeks later, but after the antibiotics. Patient was allergic to a lot of antibiotics. She stated she may have this problem, the rash because she was allergic to a lot of antibiotics. When she got the rash, she went to the Urgent Care and was given a Prednisone shot and Prednisone pills. She got some relief taking the Prednisone. Patient weight as about 5&#39; 4&#34;, she gained 8 pounds over the year while being stuck in her house. Patient stated she hasn&#39;t seen healthcare provider in a while, but she called him and he gave her the antibiotic prescription.

Patient received a 2nd dose of the pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Friday 3/12/21 and states her symptoms worsened since then.  Chest x-ray showed patchy bilateral infiltrates with concern for COVID pneumonia, also questionable vascular congestion as patient does have significant history of heart failure with pacemaker.  EKG revealed paced rhythm 87 beats per minute.  Emergency room patient was placed on BiPAP and responded well, patient was given vancomycin and cefepime for sepsis protocol.

                                                She had been in her usual state of health until tonight. Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

A 77-year-old female patient received bNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number&amp; Expiry date not reported) via unspecified route of administration in arm on 03Jun2021 (at age of 77-year-old) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 Immunization. Patient medical history includes Memory Loss, Breast Cancer, Allergic to Sulfa Medication, Flexeril, Allergic to Clams and Shellfish, Pneumonia, Urinary infection. Patient concomitant medications were not reported. Caller reporting on behalf of his wife who received her first Covid 19 vaccine on 03Jun2021 and she developed pneumonia and a urinary infection. She was prescribed amoxicillin for her infection. The caller wanted to know how the antibiotic will affect his wife. He reports her second Covid 19 vaccine is past due by 2 weeks. He reports his wife gets pneumonia every year and it is not from the Covid 19 vaccine. She received her first Covid 19 vaccine on 03Jun2021 and was due for the second Covid 19 vaccine on 24Jun2021. This is discrepant from the above information that his wife is past due by 2 weeks but is documented as provided by the caller. She will not be able to get the second Covid 19 vaccine until the first week in Jul2021. She waited because she was prescribed a Z-pack for her pneumonia started on 29Jun2021.She developed a urinary infection, she has a history of getting urinary infections too. The doctor also wanted a chest x-ray to make sure that her pneumonia was gone. The Amoxicillin will double check that his wife has no more pneumonia and will clear up her urinary infection. She was hospitalized in 2019 because of a urinary infection. The doctor prescribed Amoxicillin and she cannot wait any longer to get her second Covid 19 vaccine. She must get her second Covid 19 vaccine before time runs out. He reports none of this has to do with the Covid 19 vaccine. These are problems that his wife has had before.Upon follow up when probing for information regarding the sore arm he and his wife experienced he reports the sore arm was minor, it was just where the injection was in jun2021. His wife had breast cancer and can only get injections in one of her arms. It was a little soreness, nothing, barely noticeable. He and his wife did exactly what the pharmacist said, they took a lot of fluids, drank Gatorade for electrolytes. He reports his wife is sleeping right now because she was at the doctor&#39;s office this morning. He reports his wife&#39;s doctor is being thorough before his wife gets the second Covid 19 vaccine. He is supposed to call the pharmacy to schedule his wife&#39;s second Covid 19 vaccine on 03Jul2021. The pharmacist told him not to cancel his wife original appointment because it would remove her from the system. He&#39;s will call on 03Jul2021 and hopefully his wife will be able to get her second dose on 05Jul2021 or 06Jul2021. At that time, she&#39;ll almost be off the Amoxicillin. He is asking what the effectiveness rate is of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine while on an antibiotic.The pharmacist told him the effectiveness is diminished for people who have taken an antibiotic. He believes the first Covid 19 vaccine provides 70% effectiveness while the second Covid 19 vaccine provides 95% effectiveness. His sister-in-law has titanium plates in her back and must take an antibiotic for the rest of her life and she received the Covid 19 vaccine. Advised in response to caller to discuss with Health care professional about the final decision about receiving the second dose to discuss the risks and benefits of the administration of the vaccine and the HCP is most familiar with the health history of his wife. Pfizer is unable to make treatment recommendations for individual patients. Patient underwent lab test and procedures include Chest X-ray result was it showed nothing, no pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2 test was negative; Urine analysis result was unknown; all tests done on Jun2021.

                                                Two days following the vaccination, patient (my mom) began to have hallucinations of seeing family members in her home that weren&#39;t there, and it was exasperated throughout the week. The first noticeable hallucination was on a Sunday (6/20) and she was sent to the hospital that Thursday evening (6/24). As of today (7/1) she is still in the hospital and experiencing hallucinations. Mom/Patient was recently diagnosed with alzheimers and although there has been confusion over the last few months, the onset and intensity of delusions did not start until the 20th.

This consumer reported same events for two patients (one is patient self). This is the first of two reports. This 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration to right arm on 13Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfas, Penicilins, and Avelox, Sulfa or Penicillin allergies since she was a child and had the Avelox allergies about 15-16 years ago. None concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. Did get the original Shingles vaccine about 3 years ago and then they came out with the new one and she got the first dose of that and believes she had a reaction to that one, thinks it was a rash. Also had the flu shot and she usually gets sick with it, but didn&#39;t with this last one. Thinks her body is just delicate. No vaccines administered on same date. Patient had the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on 13Jan2021 15:00 and she was fine. She had a reaction the following day (on 14Jan2021). At 11am the next day she got very dizzy and felt like she was going to faint, pass out at any second. Used cold compresses and drank water and took deep breaths, but she didn&#39;t pass out. She had a funny taste in her mouth. Then from that time until about 7pm she had urine issues and kept going to the bathroom to urinate and had diarrhea and upset stomach. Patient felt like she was out of her body, felt very weird, strange. Doctor stated she maybe had a reaction to the vaccine and recommended for her to take Tylenol. She didn&#39;t take it until right before going to bed. She was able to sleep on 14th night. Woke up the next morning and was fine. She didn&#39;t see any of these reactions listed and that happened. Patient explained to a friend of the reactions and the friend mentions that she also had a friend who had the vaccine and had the same exact reactions, everything. Everything improved and stopped the next morning she was fine, on the 15th. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. The events outcome was recovered on 15Jan2021. It was just a span of time and she has to assume that it was the vaccine since she has never had that before. Patient does not know if she should blame the vaccine because she also has a lot of allergies to a lot of antibiotics and does not know what caused her reactions.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021065869 Same reporter/ vaccine/ AEs, different patient

                                                Urinary tract infection; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection Batch/lot number: EL9266) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 15Feb2021 as 1st dose, single and bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection Batch/lot number: EN6206) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 08Mar2021 as 2nd dose, single both for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID in Dec2020, she did not felt good, but it was not bad, was tired, lost her sense of taste and smell. Concomitant medications were reported as none. Patient got both doses of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID19 vaccine. After each dose, she had a UTI. On 19Feb2021, patient experienced urinary tract infection which was ongoing. Reportedly, she got her first shot on a Monday, and by Saturday she had to go to Urgent Care because she had a Urinary Tract Infection. They gave her medicine, and it cleared it up. Then, she got the second COVID vaccine, and within the same time frame she was back at the Urgent care with another urinary tract infection. She got her second dose on a Monday. On Friday, she had symptoms. On Saturday she went to urgent care and got antibiotics because she had a Urinary Tract Infection and said that her urologist has seen other people have a UTI after the vaccine. Patient wanted to know if it has anything to do with the vaccine. Patient just went to the doctor Tuesday. They are sending of a test. She was going to go back and see the doctor at the end of the Month. She mentioned that she had COVID in December2020 (2 days before Christmas). She didn&#39;t feel good, but it was not bad. She was tired and lost her sense of taste and smell. She asked if it is okay to get vaccinated after having covid. On 01Feb2021, they told her she was alright to get it, but she thinks she should have waited later. After the first vaccine, she was prescribed Nitrofurantoin mono MCR, with expiration date 23Mar2022 and after the second vaccine she was prescribed Amoxicillin Clavulanic. She seemed alright again before she got the second dose. She got both doses on a Monday, and by Friday she was having issues, and then she went to Urgent care on Saturday both times. The first medication she was on for the UTI, Nitrofurantoin says not to be vaccinated on that medication. She was off the medication a week or so by the time she got the second vaccine. Patient called her doctor, and she said it was okay for her to go ahead and get the second dose. After the first vaccine she started feeling symptomatic 19Feb2021 and went to urgent care on 20Feb2021. After the second vaccine she started feeling symptomatic 12Mar2021 and went to urgent care the 13Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included covid-19 resulted as positive on Dec2020. Patient questioned was it okay to get vaccinated after having COVID. The clinical outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021452640 Same reporter/ drug/ event for different patients

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

The patient basically is maintained in the nursing home in this state of being bed-bound and nonverbal.  She was recently transferred to Rehab after she developed a stage IV sacral ulcer at a previous nursing home.  The patient had been seeing wound care and doing very well.  Her stage IV sacral ulcer had been healed to a stage II.  She had been gaining weight.  Unfortunately, at her wound care appointment yesterday the wound had decompensated a little bit and had started to drain some purulent material.  It also enlarged in size a little bit.  I was called yesterday afternoon and the nursing home reported the patient was not wanting to eat or drink.  Lab work showed a sodium of 170 and creatinine consistent with acute kidney injury.  She also appeared to have a urinary tract infection.  Because of her critical labs she was sent to the nursing home.  The patient was evaluated in the nursing home and then admitted to the floor.  She was given Zosyn and vancomycin and started on IV fluids.  The emergency room physician did counsel the family that the prognosis was very grim.  The patient has done reasonably well overnight.  She has been grimacing quite a bit and the family has decided they just want her kept comfortable    comfort care during admission

Medical history included Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (states she was diagnosed about 40 years ago), Allergies, lung collapses (due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), preemie, no fusion in her eyes (States she sees out of one eye most of the time), does not retain sodium and potassium (related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), egg allergy. The patient previous received pneumonia and shingles vaccine for immunization and was fine, the first dose of the bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration in arm on unspecified date as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and fine. Concomitant medication included potassium as does not retain potassium; spironolactone; a list of medications. Her mom got her 2nd dose on Sunday and is in the process of needing to report that. She ended up with severe gut, lower abdominal, intestinal pain and bloating along with other normal things. States she saw her doctor yesterday and he believes it could be caused by the Propylene Glycol in the vaccine. Her mother received her shot at 3pm on 4Apr2021 and does not know which arm. Her symptoms started around 8:30 with body aches everywhere, a severe headache, her bones and joints were hurting so bad she couldn&#39;t barely walk much, she made it to the bathroom and that was it, and nausea. Caller states by 10 her mom had hard cramping, that it started at 8:30 with cramping in her abdomen and severe bloating. States her mom could still void but it was pressure tying to go and caused severe pain and abdominal pain was causing pain to void. Caller provides that her mom continues the same until Tuesday morning and then the intestinal cramping and bloating is still continuing now and it&#39;s more primarily her lower left area as of Wednesday. She has a big history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and her doctor that she met with yesterday feels this is probably from the propylene glycol component that caused the flare up, as she usually doesn&#39;t have this and he is hoping it will calm down in about a week. Her mom also couldn&#39;t eat or anything until Tuesday. She was down all of Sunday night and Monday for about 36 hours. Stated the voiding is somewhat better but not much better and the rest of the symptoms are consolidated and persisting. Reporter stated her mom can&#39;t go without her medications. Her mom did a virtual doctor visit and will follow up later this week. Her mother got the second dose of the vaccine and had severe intestinal pain, headache, joint pain, nausea, abdominal pain. The outcome of the event Dysuria was recovering, Unable to eat was recovered on 06Apr2021, other events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The past drug event included tetracycline, arithromycin, Levaquin, ceftin, Zithromax that caused drug allergy (ongoing). Concomitant medications included levothyroxine (Other products: Yes) taken for thyroid disorder (had it for 30 years or more and had been taking for the same then). The patient previously took doxycycline and experienced diarrhoea, tetracycline and experienced drug hypersensitivity, erythromycin and experienced drug hypersensitivity, levaquin and experienced drug hypersensitivity. It was mentioned that no investigation assessment was done. She came home on an airplane on 03Jan2019, the year COVID started. When she got back, she told her doctor she thought she had gotten Covid, so they tested her, but she was negative. She thought she had it and volunteered for antibodies. She did not get over it until mid Jan2019. They told her she was over it for too long though if she had it. It was mentioned that history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine, prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) if applicable, list any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration were reported as none. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She has ongoing symptoms that started after she received the vaccine. She only got the first dose. On an unknown date in 2021, she started having headaches that she never knows when they are going to come on and they are continual. She did not have them before she got the vaccine. She did not remember the start date and said it was right away after the first dose that she received about a month and a half ago. It started right away. She was not getting the second one because the headaches would not go away. They become more continuous and more often. She was hesitant to get the vaccine because she was allergic to just about all antibiotics. She does not have names, lot or expirations for any. She later provided that Penicillin gave her hives so bad. She was loaded with hives and was a pimply mess. She also said that Doxycycline gave her severe diarrhea. She then found her list and also provided allergies to the following: Tetracycline, Arithromycin, Sulfa, Levaquin, Ceftin, Zithromax, and no contrast Iodine. She does not remember the exact reaction. It is either severe hives or severe diarrhea. She does not have the lot or expiration for any of them. No further details provided. She had another issues immediately after the shot. She had funny bone pain in the right arm but she got the shot in the left arm. This pain was described as a nerve pain that would go all the way up and down her right arm. It would come at night after the shot but then it went away. She does not have it right now. Right now she was trying to get rid of a UTI. It was recently within the last 2 weeks ago. She started medication for it and they did not help. She had a call into the doctor and she was still dizzy and had bad effects for the UTI. She took the medication and had to refill it. Medication was Nitrofurantoin Mono Mcr 100 mg. One capsule every 12 hours. It was in a pharmacy vial with unknown lot or expiration. She did a refill and took it twice. She finished them and has none left. Her friends were upset because she would not get second shot and certainly not a third because of these headaches. She felt she may take a chance at getting something worse than these headaches. She does not feel she should get them or anymore. The patient did not require emergency room and physician office visit. She had been to her doctor since and she mentioned the headaches, and all they say was to take Advil. Outcome of the events headache, urinary tract infection and dizzy was not recovered, whereas other events were recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; manufacturer reported as Pfizer-Wyeth; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 21Jan2021 12:30 at 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis in back; always had diarrhea because she had cancer and is unable to control her bowels. They tell her she has a lot of fiber in her food; but she can&#39;t control it; if she eats vegetables then she knows what&#39;s happening; but she always tries to take Imodium A-D before eating vegetables. She mentioned to them if she did not eat vegetables all she could eat is meat and cheese; doctor told her she was borderline diabetic, so she has wanted to keep up with that. The doctor was not worried about it; ongoing acid reflux; pain; and ongoing high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for acid reflux, ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure, naproxen for arthritis in back, caffeine, codeine phosphate, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE) for pain, loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM A-D) for diarrhea. The patient has not received any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the covid-19 vaccine. Vaccinations reported as she has gotten flu shots and pneumonia shot and has never had any adverse events, reactions or problems with those; nothing. The reporter mentioned that she got her first dose of the vaccine in a clinic on 21Jan2021 and aware that the second dose will be on 16Feb2021. The patient reported that she felt bad after taking the first dose-flu like symptoms on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and had high fever Saturday (23Jan2021), urine became yellowish-brown and wants to know more information. The patient guesses she is having an allergic reaction on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and asked for further information about the allergic reaction relative to the vaccine. On Saturday (23Jan2021), she was feeling good. She got up, went to store, came back and had little diarrhea symptoms then she began to get sick, feverish. She added that then the vomiting, then achy like flu symptoms. She still feels feverish, she has a really bitter taste, or no taste in her mouth really but it&#39;s going away. To her it seems like the worst part is over. She almost called 911 but then did not want to go the hospital because of all the people with COVID in the hospital. The next day on 24Jan2021, when she woke up, she was not as fevered. She can check her own self with her hand and it was like she put her hand on a stove. She went to sleep and the next morning (24Jan2021), she was not as feverish; her mouth still has that nasty, old bitter taste that does not go away with brushed teeth. She feels better today (unspecified date). She mentioned that the second dose is scheduled to be administered 16Feb2021, but she really does not want to go get that if she feels like this. She had blood work for her sugar done on 21Jan2021 because she is borderline diabetic, but results are unknown, have not had any results yet. The outcome of the events was recovering.

This 81-years-old female (at the time of vaccination weight; 58.97 kg, height; 160 cm) nurse reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number; EL9269) Is COVID19 vaccine a Pfizer product; Yes, COVID19 vaccine manufacturer; unspecified, NDC number, expiry date; unknown via an unspecified route of administration from 02Feb2021 at 04:00 pm to 02Feb2021 at 04:00 pm at single dose (dose number;1) on left arm for covid-19 immunisation. Identification of the country where the drug was obtained: Country of authorization/application. Vaccination Facility Type; Health facility, Vaccine Administered at a Facility; No. Patient&#39;s medical history included thyroidectomy had in 1968, blood pressure, neuropathy, back surgery, breast cancer (dates unspecified), family history relevant to AE; none. Past drug event included Aromasin for breast cancer; inflammatory response, historical vaccine included Tetanus Diphtheria; about 4 weeks before, no specific information available. Relevant Tests: Urinalysis on 09Feb2021, diagnosed with bladder infection. Specific values not provided. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine, 88mcg one time a day by mouth for she been taking this since she had thyroidectomy for thyroid, amlodipine, 5mg one time a day from 5 years or so for blood pressure. Caller received the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine a week ago. 24 hours after vaccination on 07Feb2021 she could not get comfortable from a lot of pain, which went on for 24-36 hours. She went to urgent care for this and the doctor made her take a urinalysis and diagnosed her with a bladder infection. She was given antibiotics for this and the symptoms have gotten a lot better. She went to the ER on 10Feb2021 and the physician diagnosed her with chronic muscle tension. Caller also added that she had an underlying neuropathy from a back surgery as well as inflammatory response to medication she took for breast cancer 20 years ago. She wanted to check if her side effects may be related to the covid vaccine. Caller needs some information, stated she had the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago today, 02Feb2021 at the (Name) (Name), states she also has some underlying conditions, like neuropathy and that sort of thing associated with a back surgery she had 3 years ago, states numbness has been increasing over time. Caller states that the first 24 hours after the vaccine were fine, night after 24 hours couldn&#39;t sleep, pain, numbness and shaky and just a train wreck on 07Feb2021. Caller states she was so uncomfortable she went to urgent care. Doctor stated the symptoms could be a urinary infection, was diagnosed bladder infection on 09Feb2021 and was prescribed Keflex for treatment. Thinking perhaps it was coincidental, has had an inflammatory response to another medication Aromasin for breast cancer treatment. States this was before, 15 years ago, does not have information to provide, no lot, expiration, or NDC number. States she is just familiar with the inflammatory thing. Caller&#39;s question is have we had any reports such as this, any inflammatory responses. The events were not considered serious. Investigation Assessment: No. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room; no, Physician Office; Yes, patient went to Urgent Care. If Yes, which AE(s); pain and numbness. If the patient was hospitalized, how many days was the hospital stay; Not hospitalized. The outcome of events of pain, hypoaesthesia, insomnia and nervousness was recovering while for cystitis was unknown and for muscle tightness was unknown..

She was Coumadin been longtime because her Chad vascular score was high she also had a history of congestive heart failure in addition of chronic atrial fibrillation heart rate is fluctuated in the range of 80-120. She is currently on digoxin we will continue digoxin she is currently on Toprol which started 50 mg and currently 100 mg Toprol she also have a Cardizem with splitting the medication 120 mg p.o. twice daily. Heart rate is better controlled today blood pressure is low borderline this patient need to be watched even in the nursing home for further evaluation of medication adjustment. She also mentioned that she is having chronic hypokalemia potassium was replaced alert here and so then started potassium 20 M EQ p.o. twice daily may need to further adjustment and follow-up potassium in the nursing she she was tachycardic heart rate in module was started recently as 7 days ago now her heart rate is much better now this patient need to see endocrinologist also to follow-up.   Patient was complicated with urinary retention and continue straight cath and finally ended up with Foley&#39;s catheter this patient must need to evaluate by urology for further evaluation of chronic urinary retention. Meanwhile patient clinically stable vitals are good she does not have any fever shortness of breath tolerable with 3 L of oxygen now she does not have any chest pain she is not in any myasthenia gravis medication this patient will benefit to see follow-up with pulmonary group for post Covid pneumonia require long-term intubation and also neurology for myasthenia gravis Dr. This patient will benefit to a urologist outpatient and also physician to nursing home need to adjust medication in the setting of hypotension tachycardia we will continue Coumadin current dose 7.5 mg and may need to further adjustment slowly. She is currently on 3 L of oxygen we will continue and titrate down slowly.     Discharge disposition is nursing home Condition upon discharge patient is awake alert oriented no chest pain still 3 L of oxygen tolerable.

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a known history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.  She presented to the emergency room after being transported from a local nursing home.  Apparently, the patient was acting a little bit more confused than normal and she was looking more short of breath than normal.  The nursing home nurse stated that her oxygen saturations were in the upper 80s without oxygen and the patient looked visibly more short of breath than normal.  Because of this, the nursing home made the decision to send the patient in.  When paramedics arrived at the nursing home they placed 2 L of oxygen on her and her oxygen saturations went up into the high 90s.  The patient does dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She did not miss a dialysis treatment this week.  The patient has had her coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and several months ago did have coronavirus (COVID-19) at the local nursing home.  The patient does have mild dementia and so is somewhat of an unreliable historian.  Transferred to pleural effusion

                                                Severe nausea; weight loss; stomach pain; bladder infection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient). An 82-year-old female patient not pregnant received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose (at the age of 82-years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included tachycardia, hypothyroidism and Covid prior vaccination (date unknown). Concomitant medications in two weeks prior to the vaccination included metoprolol succinate (TOPROL), levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL). The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIUM DS) and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  Patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 30Mar2021 patient experienced severe nausea, weight loss, stomach pain and bladder infection. Patient had three visits to primary care doctor (dr), one clinic visit for intravenous (iv) fluids, emergency room (ER) Visit and hospital admission. Patient was admitted for three days in response to the events (dates were not provided). Events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), Disability or permanent damage. The patient underwent laboratory tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test (Nasal Swab) negative on 14Apr2021 and sars-cov-2 test (Nasal Swab) negative on 16Apr2021. Patient had not recovered from the events, at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information it is unlikely that BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) contributed to events occurrence. The reported events more likely represent intercurrent medical conditions unrelated to Covid-19 vaccination. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Lymphedema in her legs/ got lymphedema about 5-6 days after the second Pfizer vaccine; Legs were hurting like the devil; Legs were about six times the size they should be/ she has intense swelling; Peeing too much; Doesn&#39;t feel right; she is just so weak; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). An 82-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261; Expiration Date: 31May202, NDC: 59267-1000-2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 06Feb2021 at 12:00 as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing emphysema, ongoing breast cancer from 2007 (she did not take chemo, just radiation) and ongoing follicular lymphoma from 2014 (did not take chemo, just radiation. Cancer was in the bone marrow, said she didn&#39;t think that has anything to do with it, has had two operations) and bone marrow cancer. The patient previously took budesonide/ formoterol fumarate (SYMBICORT) she was using SYMBICORT, but her doctor switched it a few months ago, back to ANORO), prochlorperazine maleate (COMPAZINE) she takes a couple of times per month, takes 10mg when she feels nauseated and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) she takes when she needs it. Concomitant medications included furosemide (LASIX) at 40 mg, twice a day (one 40mg pill in the morning and one 40mg pill at night) from 1985 to an unspecified date and then increased to 80 mg, twice a day (two pills (80mg total) in the morning and two (80 mg total) at night) from on an unspecified date and ongoing for blood pressure; ongoing simvastatin (ZOCOR) taken for high triglycerides; umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol trifenatate (ANORO). Patient thought she has been on Lasix since 1985 but can&#39;t remember back that far. She was taking Zocor for a long time and stated Anoro Inhaler was a fairly new medication. For Anoro inhaler, patient stated she pulls back the thing and didn&#39;t know, maybe it pinches a pill and inhales the white powder. Relevant family medical history included none and both parents were deceased. Patient stated that her oncologist does blood tests once every four months, a test for markers and stuff like that, CBC, metabolic panel and bloodwork every 4 months. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL3246, Expiration date: 30Apr2021, NDC: 59267-1000-2) via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 14Jan2021 12:00 pm for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that, the patient has very sexy legs, but she doesn&#39;t anymore, says she got lymphedema about 5-6 days after the second Pfizer vaccine in Feb2021. She was now going to physical therapy, to bear her out and try to understand what she&#39;s saying. Caller states 30% of the people there that have had cancer and had radiation, get the same side effect she has had, some people have it in the arms, she got hers in her leg, says she has intense swelling, called lymphedema, says her legs look like they belong on an elephant. Caller said at the physical therapy place, 30% of people who have come in for help had radiation treatment for some kind of cancer, all have different kinds of cancer, but the swelling, the lymphedema, was the side effect they&#39;ve all experienced. Caller states that no one has called Pfizer and let Pfizer know, states she won&#39;t take the booster, won&#39;t have anything to do with this, says it&#39;s too scary. Caller states she was an active person, never had a problem with legs swelling or anything like that and now, her look like legs that belong on an elephant. Caller states the correlation seems to be with radiation treatment, because she has bone marrow cancer, and other ladies have breast cancer, states the only thing we all have in common was different treatments but in her own case she had no chemo, but she did have radiation. It seems like with radiation this swelling was an after effect. Caller says it&#39;s 2 or 3 things, not just that they had cancer or radiation treatment, says those of us who had radiation also got this swelling. Caller states she never had any trouble with legs or anything, says she was an active person. States some people experienced this four days after the vaccine, says hers started six days after the vaccine, says she woke up one morning, and her legs were huge. States usually legs were smaller in the morning. Caller wonders what were the ingredients that causes swelling. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it, says like overnight turned a switch on and now her legs were going to be big and fat and ugly. Caller states the reason she&#39;s calling was because at physical therapy last Thursday, other people who had the shot had the same side effect, says the only thing the lady said, she wasn&#39;t sure if she was a nurse or not, was the relationship was not with the kind of cancer, but the radiation treatment and the shot has been causing this and wasn&#39;t surprised. Caller says she was told that about 30% that they&#39;re handling now had the Pfizer vaccine. Caller thinks that&#39;s all they gave in the state NC, no other vaccine here, says it just seems to be with this. Caller states the lymphedema, hers was in her legs, others have it in their arms, she doesn&#39;t know why it&#39;s happening. Caller states about six days after the second shot, she can&#39;t remember exactly what day, about six to seven days, she woke up one morning, and her legs were hurting like the devil in Feb2021, stated her legs were about six times the size they should be in Feb2021. Caller states usually in the morning, the swelling goes down, but this woke her up out of the blue like zap, says no warning, no nothing, just one day she woke up and that where it was. Caller states her doctor increased Lasix, she used to take one 40mg pill in the morning and one 40mg pill at night, increased it to two pills (80mg total) in the morning and two (80 mg total) at night. Caller states she is now only taking one-and-a-half-pills this morning, because she doesn&#39;t feel right and she was peeing too much in Feb2021 and was not feeling right. She doesn&#39;t want to get dehydrated. Caller states she has a doctor appointment 10Jun2021 and was going to tell him she was taking less because she was just so weak in Feb2021. Says she was weak because she&#39;s taking too much Lasix, states she was taking two 40mg morning and night. Caller states she was just concerned, she has big legs, fat legs, she calls them fat. The patient not visited emergency room. The events result in the patient visited physician office. Patient reported that she has had no shots for four months however she was going to get the high dose flu shot on 01Oct2021. No relevant tests were performed at the time of this report. The outcome of the events lymphedema and Legs were about six times the size they should be was not recovered and outcome for the other events was unknown.  No further details provided. Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information requested.

An 83-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 24Feb2021, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included mild asthma, dementia (moments like putting things in the wrong place and being forgetful) and was confused. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) received at age 83 years, on 03Feb2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. On 24Feb2021, after the second vaccinations, the patient&#39;s arm was sore. On 06Mar2021, the patient began just feeling bad, was having like a terrible time, having a hard time, was really not feeling good; was more confused; lethargic; had trouble getting her up, was having to do everything for her, feed her, bathe her; couldn&#39;t walk and lost her appetite. On 09Mar2021, the patient was shutting down. On the same day at 18:30, the patient had gone in the bathroom and said it burned when she peed. So, the patient was taken to urgent care so it would not get out of hand. At the urgent care, they said she has a UTI, there was blood in her urine so they gave her Cipro but they cultured her urine and it grew no bacteria but there was still blood in her urine and she was getting worse with sleeping and she didn&#39;t even get up to eat. The patient was also dehydrated and her urine was dark. The events dehydrated, urine was dark, it burned when she peed, blood in her urine required emergency visit on 16Mar2021. The reporter thought the patient was going to die. On 16Mar2021, in the ER, they did blood work (unknown result), chest xray which showed she had a spot where her lung was starting to collapse (they said it was a tiny place, from not getting up and moving around, they said it would correct itself) and the patient&#39;s potassium, Vitamin D and Vitamin B12 were low. They did a CT scan of the head and chest to look for stroke or seizure and there was nothing. They blamed it on her dementia that had suddenly progressed. The patient was hospitalized from 16Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. On 12Mar2021, the patient experienced cellulitis in her arm. The reporter clarified that the cellulitis was further down her arm, around her wrist hand area. Her wrist was huge, hot, red, and her hand was swollen. On 24Mar2021, the patient followed up with the family doctor because the hospital wanted her to follow up with a GYN because they didn&#39;t feel it was urinary at all. When the reporter took the patient in to see the doctor, she couldn&#39;t walk in, she had to roll her in a wheelchair, she had stopped talking again. On 26Mar2021, the doctor sent the patient to the emergency room (unspecified reason) and they kept her. They said her said lactic acid was high. She was admitted on 26Mar2021 and discharged on 29Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s potassium was 3.3 and her lactic acid level was back to 2. The patient was recovering from lactic acid was high; potassium, Vitamin D and Vitamin B12 were low; began just feeling bad/having like a terrible time/having a hard time/really not feeling good; more confused; lethargic; had trouble her getting up/was having to do everything for her, feed her, bathe her; couldn&#39;t walk; lost her appetite; was shutting down; stopped talking. The patient recovered from cellulitis in her arm/ cellulitis was further down her arm, around her wrist hand area (Her wrist was huge, hot, red, and her hand was swollen) in Mar2021; and arm was sore on 29Mar2021. The outcome of events spot where her lung was starting to collapse, dementia had suddenly progressed; she was dehydrated because her urine was dark; it burned when she peed; blood in her urine; and wanted to sleep/getting worse with sleeping was unknown.

Prior to her recent hospitalization she or the daughter had no knowledge of her severe hiatal hernia but she did admit to early satiety and poor po intake for a few months. Patient is an 84-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recurrent urinary tract infections who presented to the emergency room on 6/1/2021 due to some dysuria, frequency, nausea, vomiting and increased confusion. She denied any fever or chills or any abdominal pain but did report some acid reflux symptoms and poor appetite. she was ultimately admitted with a suspected urinary tract infection. She was also profoundly electrolyte depleted with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hyponatremia due to poor p.o. intake. She was started on IV fluids and electrolyte repletion was also started on Rocephin based on her old cultures and subsequently admitted. Patient&#39;s urine and blood cultures ultimately produce no growth and a urinary tract infection was ruled out. She was found the day after admission with a large amount of black emesis covering her sheets. When questioned patient reported that she had been vomiting during the night. Stool OB was ultimately positive. Her DVT prophylactic heparin was discontinued. She was started on IV Protonix. CT of the abdomen pelvis was ordered. CT revealed nearly the entire stomach was above the left hemidiaphragm with air-fluid levels but there was no significant distention seen. The case was discussed with our general surgical team and the decision was made to transfer the patient to a higher level of care for a GI/EGD evaluation .She was transferred on 6/3/21. She was ultimately discharged on 6/7/21 home after being found to have a gastric volvulous. On 6/21 she returned for Robotic-assisted laparoscopic repair of a giant hiatal hernia with Bilateral placement of pleural pigtail catheters as both pleural linings were densely adhesed to the hernia sac.

                                                UTI; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for a parent (mother). A 83-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: EL1283; Expiration date was not reported), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 30Jan2021 10:30 (at the age of 83-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood cholesterol, blood pressure and thyroid condition. It was reported patient had all the usual suspects, as far as, medical conditions for her age including cholesterol, blood pressure, and thyroid. It was also reported that all three were controlled, and not an issue for patient and no further details provided. Patient had no other history. There were no concomitant medications. History of previous immunization with Pfizer vaccine and additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect included none. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine nor experienced any adverse events due to prior vaccinations. The patient experienced UTI (urinary tract infection) on 16Feb2021. The patient underwent urine analysis which resulted positive for UTI on 15Feb2021, and no more information was available. Therapeutic measures were taken because of the event. Patient&#39;s doctor prescribed antibiotics for UTI. Patient was scheduled for second COVID-19 Vaccine injection on Saturday, 20Feb2021 and was really concerned about taking the antibiotics with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Reporter asked if it is safe for patient to take the antibiotic, or should she not take the antibiotic, or should she wait to take the antibiotic until after she has had her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Caller reported that patient was prescribed Cefdinir for 5 days and does not know how many milligrams Cefdinir, the patient was prescribed. Caller said he had to go to the pharmacy to pick up the Cefdinir prescription, so did not have the Cefdinir NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reporter confirmed that patient has not started taking the Cefdinir. Caller stated that the patient said she would rather get her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose than take the Cefdinir because the COVID-19 Vaccine is more important to her. Reported stated he spoke with patient&#39;s doctor via telephone last night and described patient&#39;s symptoms to the doctor. The doctor told to have a urine test done the night before this report. And the next day morning patient&#39;s doctor called in an antibiotic prescription for patient to take for a UTI. Doctor told reporter that the patient can take the antibiotic and it would not interfere with her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. The caller stated while he trusts the patient&#39;s doctor, he wanted to know what Pfizer had to say. Patient was diagnosed with a UTI on the morning of 16Feb2021. Patient did not have to go to Emergency Room. Patient visited Physician Office due to the event. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

                                                I am an 83 year old female who was thought to have Guillain-Barre ca. 40 years ago.  I was paralyzed from the waist down, hospitalized, and had a very slow recovery.   This paralysis caused clawed toes that were straightened surgically and affected my balance and walking (I use two hiking poles as aids for walking and balance.)  Little was known at that time.    I received the first Pfizer Covid shot on April 18, 2021. Two days after I had the Covid shot, the nerves in my left leg, below the knee, were sore when pressed and the affected muscles felt numb. This has persisted and at times different nerves in my lower leg are affected.  Currently the muscles going down the back of my lower leg and around the ankle are affected.   Three nights after the Covid shot, I had severe left kidney pains, became violently sick and the following morning went to my health facility emergency care department. I had no previous kidney problems or signs of a UTI.  I had a CT scan of the kidney and was treated for a kidney infection and UTI with antibiotics. I have been to a kidney specialist and urologist with tests continuing.  My breathing was erratic for a few days and I felt nauseous for 2 weeks.  I have not had the second covid shot.

Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

                                                3/13/21 Ferrell ER to admission hpi: 84 y.o. female presented to the emergency room with complaints of back pain, nausea, and abdominal pain.  Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.  Patient was admitted to medical inpatient as it is deemed that she will need longer than a 2 midnight stay for cardiac monitoring and will work with physical therapy and occupational therapy for gait training and strengthening with relation to the compression fracture of her L2 fracture, and pain control.

                                                back was itching like the small of her back/back just itched; Arm was just barely sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 84-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL926F) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 10Feb2021 13:30 as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history includes that she was diagnosed with Lupus in 2004 and fasciitis in her foot in January2021. She had cortisone shot in her foot on 12Jan2021 and 08feb2021 within four weeks prior to vaccination. The patient previously took vitamin d2 &#43; calcium [calcium gluconate; calcium phosphate; ergocalciferol] 50mg once a week, cortisone for fasciitis on Oct2020 patient has taken flu shot and a booster for pneumococcal pneumonia however in past patient took flu shot and had flu. No adverse event prior vaccination. Patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN62W) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 03Mar2021 13:30 as second dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 10Feb2021 had first dose in her arm was barely sore. She did not feel sick or anything. About the second night (12Feb2021) after the first dose of the vaccine they were watching TV and she was sitting on the couch and noticed the small of her back was itching. It was just a little bit, and she did not pay attention because now and then she will have a little itch and did not notice it. She is calling back with questions about the same thing. Confirms that there are no new events. Since her first dose of the covid vaccine, on the second day after, that night, before she got in her bath, her back was itching. She did not pay it much attention. After her second dose of the covid vaccine, on the third day, she took her clothes off to take a shower and she had no rash, but she had chill bumps like she was cold. She read all of the information on side effects on the report. She saw where it said she could have chills. She had no problems with the injection or her arm being sore. She had no nausea, or no other symptoms that they talked about. Her skin felt like she had chills bumps from her knees to her shoulders. This has continued since. She does not have a reference number for her first report. She does not know when it went away/ over next day or 2. She told the person when got the shot that she had Lupus and asked if there was any reason, she should not get this. The nurse talked to somebody and came back and said no it would not affect it. It probably has not. She just wonders if there is something in the injection. She feels like that what caused her to itch since she has not changed her medications at all. The only thing which she came off this before she took the injection, was her rheumatologist advised all of her patients to take Vitamin D2 because of Covid. She was on that and was having some problems, the creatinine in her urine had gone up. They took her off it before she had the Covid injection. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatinine increased: increased on, blood calcium: increased. The outcome of the events was unknown. Description of complaint: While reporting an AE for Covid Shot caller mentioned that she has taken Benadryl for itching and it would calm it but she still has itching now. It makes her so sleepy and puts her to sleep. It says Diphenhydramine HCl 25mg. She sees a number where there is a barcode: 30048284, Lot: Not provided, not probed on call. She can&#39;t read an expiration date on it. She also has an old bottle. There is a barcode on it too: 312547 17031 4, Lot/Expiry date: Not provided, not probed on call. She also mentioned her doctor sent her some topical cream, but it took 2 tubes of cream to cover the itchy spot. She used some, but it did not help her at all. The topical cream she was given was Triamcinolone Acetonide ointment. It says USP, 0.1 percent. It is 15 grams. NDC: 0168-0006-15. Lots/Expiry: She does not see any other numbers or expiration date.

She also mentioned that She had a cortisone shot in her foot on 12Jan2021. On 08Feb2021 she had another cortisone shot in her foot for continued fasciitis.

An 85-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021, 11:00 am as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, stroke, heart attack, COVID-19 in Aug2020 (actually had COVID this summer in August, had the mild case), and emergency surgery in Aug2020. Concomitant medications included ajmaline (CARDIA), isosorbide, and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for cardiac disorder; and losartan. The patient her first dose on 04Feb2021 and experienced headaches, muscle aches and pains, chills, other flu-like symptoms, heart conditions, and sensitivity to eggs. She mentioned that this was normal and nothing unusual. She received her second dose on 25Feb2021 at 11:00 am. She was still kind of stiff but was okay. The next day on 26Feb2021 at 11:00 am, she noticed bright red bleeding in her urine when she emptied her bladder. After a few hours it faded. On the next day on 27Feb2021, she experienced the bright red bleeding in the urine again. The red blood did not hurt and patient was achy and headachy, &#34;you know muscles.&#34; So, that kind of happened and it just kind of eased off. She slept a lot because she felt tired and so rotten from Friday, Saturday, Sunday after getting the shot. She also had a mild low-grade fever, headaches, and body aches and pains which she considered normal. Patient was hard of hearing and did not have a bright red bleeding, just had a taint little bit till the day when she got it and then the next day, she went to the bathroom to empty her bladder again and had bright red bleeding again with some blood clots in it. Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

Multiple thoracic compression deformities better characterize on recent CT. Postoperative changes as discussed. Stable hiatal hernia.   4/23/21 RUQ Ultrasound: Mild gallbladder prominence, nonspecific. Findings similar to reference CT. No gallbladder wall thickening. Negative sonographic Murphy sign. Trace ascites. Partially evaluated right pleural effusion. Increased renal echogenicity. Correlate for medical renal disease. -1.1 cm right renal cyst.   4/22/21 PVL Study: Acute non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the mid and distal femoral vein within the right lower extremity.

An 86-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL9262 expiry date 21May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 86 years old) at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL8982) on 22Jan2021 at single dose in upper right arm and on 22Jan2021 experienced severe headache and arm hurting. Relevant medical history includes ongoing compromised immune system diagnosed many years ago, and ongoing one kidney functioning. The patient received no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021 the patient experienced high, over the top blood pressure, delirious incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware which both required hospitalization from 13Feb2021 to 14Feb2021. It was also reported they were concerned about one kidney/ was dehydrated in 13Feb2021. On 13Feb2021 unspecified blood labs showed kidney was extremely dehydrated and Chest X-ray was good. Clinical course was reported as follows: she was just released from hospital yesterday, she took the second Pfizer COVID shot, on 12Feb2021, and became so very very ill, she expected some side effects, the first shot wasn&#39;t bad, the first all she had was a severe headache and arm hurting, but that was 3 weeks ago, and the second one she can&#39;t say how horrible it was: she had to get the paramedics there, she was very very ill. It was the worst night she has had, and she is 86 years old, and has had a multitude of serious issues but that shot was the worst. It was a combination of high blood pressure, over the top, and insomnia like she couldn&#39;t budge and open her eyes, she couldn&#39;t see anything but squares, it was like a horrible, if there is such a thing as a trip, a horrible trip, something she can&#39;t imagine wishing on anyone. The county administered it, she has several doctor, she initially provides her primary care doctor, for consent to contact, but says her nephrologist would be better, as she hasn&#39;t seen her primary care doctor in some time. Her primary care doctor doesn&#39;t know she had this, another doctor gave her permission, her nephrologist. States they were more concerned in the hospital about her kidney, she has one kidney functioning and, on mistake of the hospital, they didn&#39;t connect her to hydration, the night nurse didn&#39;t, and she was dehydrated and it was affecting her kidney. Her husband tried to call Saturday, when she had this reaction at like 06:30/07:00, but there was a huge long wait, he was calling to see about side effects, but they were beyond waiting, had to get the paramedics, her blood pressure was 178/113 and heart rate was 103. First shot was 3 weeks back. It looks like she had it on 22Jan2021, the headache and arm hurting started towards the evening, the shot was taken earlier in the day, and they started in the evening, her headache was quite severe, but with Tylenol it went away, the arm is still sore from the second vaccine, but is slightly better. Clarifies she was hospitalized for the blood pressure and delirium, like, it is best explained, like delirious: incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware, all she could see was, like if she talked about people who did LSD and trips, it was a bad trip, it was squares, she wanted to open her eyes, but could only see squares. She fell asleep Friday night about 11PM, and felt this at 04:00, and she pulled off her sleep apnea mask, she had to run to the restroom, she was weak, feeling like she would slip onto the floor, and had to get right in bed, and the insomnia continued until about 7AM, that was when she started to be able to focus on like words, she was able to say words in her mind, it was like a bad nightmare. She was admitted to the hospital, she was in the emergency room (ER), the paramedics took her there Saturday, about 07:30, took her to the hospital after immediate heart checking, an intravenous (IV) of some kind, and brought her to the hospital and she was in X-rays and what not, they did procedures in the ER, and they suggested her to be observed overnight, they watched her and things started to become more normal, but she is still not clear headed, she is woozy, like foggy. High, over the top blood pressure outcome: It has been back to a good blood pressure. Insomnia is ok- she slept ok last night. What is left: the night she woke up, so early Sunday morning, in the hospital, she was profusely sweating like someone came to her room and showered her bed with water, her sheets and blankets were soaked and this morning she woke, she got up, was still very woozy, and asked her husband to help get her out of bed, and she changed her nightgown and after an hour she got in the shower, as she was sweating again, not sweating, but occasionally on and off chills, she is taking off her nightshirt and putting on a bed jacket, she gets warm and cold, hot and cold. She had blood labs a chest X-ray, heart monitor the whole time until she was discharged, and everything was good except the kidney was extremely dehydrated. This was all on Saturday as well. On her first visit to get the vaccine, at that time, the facility was a big mall, and they handed her what to look for after the injection, and she didn&#39;t notice until this morning, it says if you have an immune system that is compromised, it could affect it, and she has immune system that is compromised diagnosed many years ago. Over the top blood pressure and insomnia had resolved, arm sore was resolving, dehydrated and affecting kidney had not resolved, final outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                The day after the first shot, my mother had bad knee pain in her left knee. It went on for days/week. After the second dose, days out she started feel very tired and bad pain in her feet that went to her hands and she couldn&#39;t get out of bed or urinate properly. Her facility doctor gave her Gabepentin for the pain but it did not help. She declined over a week or so and then She was admitted into the hospital for dehydration (March 19, 2021). The put a catheter in her to get urine out and bring her kidney function back to her normal (she does have kidney disease). Gave her more Gabepentin (which does not help pain in feet an hands) and released her to rehab. and she is now on oxygen.  Rehab was bad so I got her out and released to her facility so she could receive rehab there. She declined again with the same reaction: extreme fatigue, can&#39;t walk and now urinates and defecates in an adult diaper and now breathing is very labored.  She was admitted to the hospital and they can&#39;t find out why she is in this way. They did blood work, tests, scan and X-rays without any answers. They switched up meds on her and then released her to rehab since she hasn&#39;t walked in weeks/month at this point. She is regaining strength but now on oxygen even when sitting. She is 86 and walked with a walker all around her facility and when going to doctor appointments. Now she is in a wheelchair for doctor appointments since she has no strength and needs oxygen to walk. Her facility saw her decline after the second shot and my mom is very vocal and each day told them how she felt awful and it is because of the shot. She still has neuropathy in her feet and hands but it is not as painful as it originally was and it peaked and now just painful about a 5-6 on a scale of 0-10.

A 86-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 15Jun2021 (at the age of 86-years-old) as DOSE 1, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation.

                                                Patient received the injection on May 2nd.  Following the injection, we noticed an increased weakness and general achiness.  On the  8th she was so weak that we purchased a gait belt to assist her.  We were not super concerned as we were expecting the second shot to cause body aches or flu like symptoms based on what we had heard from others who had received both vaccine shots.  She continued to be unsteady and we found that she has a mild UTI which we had begun treating with prescribed antibiotics. Late afternoon on the 11th, mother suffered a major stroke.  we did not take her to the hospital because we had already been told that they would not be able to do anything at her age should she suffer a stroke.  On the 12th I called the doctors office and asked for them to send Hospice to the house as we could tell that she was dying.  Mother died on the 13th.    Just a week prior to her death I had spoken with Dr. and we had discussed how that she was declining in health but that she was not even close to needing Hospice, yet she is dead a week later.  Less than 2 weeks after getting her second Covid Shot.

A 87-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 05Feb2021 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 15Jan2021 16:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity, Allergies to medications that contain dynacin; Allergic to Gabapentin; and has allergies to all antibiotics that end with &#39;cycline&#39;. Pertinent Details Include surgical procedures and dates: She was given doxycycline which made her pass out and lose complete control of muscles and everything and put her in the hospital for 3 days. The pharmacy gave her about 5 other medications that end with &#39;cycline&#39; and she was highly allergic to all of that so when she goes to the doctor she cannot take anything that has that in it. There were no concomitant medications. About a week after her second dose, she started having severe headache, pain in her legs, weakness, and fatigue. At one point, she collapsed because of weakness in her legs. Caller said they have gone to their HCP 6 times: 3 times with their urgent care doctor, 2 times with doctor, and 1 time in the emergency room. She wanted to know what to do with the adverse events. On 04Feb2021 she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and started on Cephalexin 7 day therapy as antibiotic and Phenazopyridine for pain with the UTI. On 14Feb2021 she saw her primary care doctor for severe headache. She was sent to the emergency room for the severe headache where she had a CAT scan in case she was having a brain bleed or stroke, but everything checked out just fine, they thought they were safe. On 16Feb2021 she was seen and had urine testing that showed the UTI she had had not cleared up, it had worsened. She was prescribed Ciprofloxacin 10 day antibiotic therapy for the UTI but only took Ciprofloxacin for 8.5 days because of all the side effects she was experiencing. On 22Feb2021 she saw her primary care physician for leg pain, weakness, fatigue and the same severe headache that she was seen for on 14Feb2021. On 22Feb2021 she was prescribed Cyclobenzaprine as a muscle relaxer and Tramadol as pain medication. Before she took any of the Cyclobenzaprine or Tramadol on the night of 22Feb2021 her legs collapsed on her. On 24Feb2021 they called the doctor and told them that she had collapsed again and he said to stop the Cyclobenzaprine and changed Tramadol dose to half strength. She started being shaky. On 26Feb2021 they called the doctor back because she had the same symptoms with the addition of vomiting. They said to stop the Tramadol and start taking Tylenol. On 27Feb2021 they went back to the urgent care for the same symptoms as well as leg pain, thigh pain, hip pain, being real shaky and real weak. Each time they were seen by the doctor or at urgent care they drew blood and said everything was ok. On 02Mar2021 they started thinking maybe it&#39;s the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She called to ask if these events are side effects of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Her bloodwork was fine, her urine tests since after 16Feb2021 are fine, the CAT scan showed her head is fine; but she still has severe weakness; she was walking with a cane now and before she was very active.

                                                On Tuesday, March 9th, a friend of mine went to my mother&#39;s home to take her to a scheduled dentist appointment. Upon arrival, she observed that my mother was disoriented and her vision was impaired. Specifically, her right pupil was completely off to the right side, her eye was irritated and slightly swollen. Per recommendation from the primary care office, my mother was taken to the emergency room. She remained hospitalized for two weeks during which time, several labs and x-rays were performed; several ideas surfaced regarding root cause including Miller Fisher Syndrome, mini-stroke, etc. but no final diagnosis was identified.

A 88-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021,single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included chronic kidney disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing , atrial fibrillation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing , pulmonary hypertension, allergies to medications, food, or other products: clindamycin, levofloxacin, sulfa drugs, penicillin from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient started having fatigue immediately after 2nd dose vaccination. 3 days later (27Mar2021), patient had very poor appetite, abdominal pain and started having confusion. 6 days later (30Mar2021), patient was hospitalized for acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure. Events resulted in going to the emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse event was IV rehydration, levophed, vasopressin, dobutamine, cefepime and flagyl. The outcome of the events was unknown. No COVID prior vaccination. Patient had COVID test post vaccination (nasal swab) on 31Mar2021 with result of negative.  No follow-up attempts are possible.; Sender&#39;s Comments: By close temporal relationship, the company cannot completely exclude a contributory role of BNT162b2 in the development of the reported diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure. Medical history including  chronic kidney disease in the setting of elderly age, cannot be also excluded as confounding factors.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The fatigue is their primary concern, as this is so profound she will fall asleep on the toilet or even in the middle of getting dressed.  Appetite is decreased, but she denies N/V/D.  She feels &#34;chilled&#34;, but no known fevers, no rigors/sweats.  Cough is occasionally productive of sputum, mostly clear but sometimes with small &#34;chunks&#34;; no hemoptysis.  No LE edema.  No HA or changes in taste/smell.  No known sick contacts, but patient has exposure to multiple daughters who help care for her, and she has been attending church recently.  Urine is dark/strong, but she denies dysuria.   Pt has received both doses of COVID-19 vaccine, second dose on 3/17/21.   Hospital Course:    Patient was admitted to medical floor for COVID-19 infection and urinary tract infection.  Patient had a very mild course of illness.  Decadron was started but patient did not require any remdesivir.  Patient has remained at her seen home oxygen requirement.  Patient was seen by PT and OT services for generalized weakness.  Blood cultures have been negative.  Patient is medically stable for discharge home today.  She will need another 2 days of antibiotics treatment for urinary tract infection.  Since her respiratory status has been very stable, we have chosen to discontinue the use of Decadron upon discharge to avoid any changes in mental status induced by steroids in an elderly patient.  Home health services and remote monitoring kit have been ordered at the time of discharge.   I have called patient&#39;s daughter  to provide update that patient is coming home today and answered her questions

Later the daughter admitted that she had had increased weaknesss and confusion for a few weeks.  She was seen in her PCP&#39;s office and diagnosed with a UTI and gout.  The x-ray of her knee later showed a fracture of her proximal tibia.    A few days later she was brought to the emergency department with a wide complex tachycardia and acute coronary syndrome.  She had an 11 day stay complicated with congestive heart failure, hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia and metabolic encpehalopathy.    Her daughter thinks that this was brought on by the vaccine, and asked us to fill out a vaers.
