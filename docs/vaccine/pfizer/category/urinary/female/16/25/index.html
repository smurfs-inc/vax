                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

                                                For both doses of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine (1st - April 7th, 2nd - April 28th), I developed a Urinary Tract Infection within 2 days of the vaccination. I was treated for the UTI caused by the first dose, and the infection had gone away prior to receiving the second dose of the vaccine, in which I then developed another Urinary Tract Infection following the second dose.

Over the next several days she had migraines, fever, nausea, diarrhea.  She had a very heavy period that was not normal for her.  She was treated twice for presumed UTI (once with macrobid and then with cefuroxime) in the days after the vaccine though cultures ended up negative.  She was referred to me, a hematologist, when she was noted to have a dropping hemoglobin and platelet count.  She appears to have a Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and possibly ITP.  She is feeling a little better but her labs remain abnormal.  Please note this was reported on Pfizer website as well but I have not been contacted.  Guidance would be sincerely appreciated.  My cell phone was provided.

Outcome of all the events  was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  Coombs negative hemolytic anemia and other events  due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height. AE Details and time of onset: Sore Throat 12:00 on 29 Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling 20:00 Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102: 21:00 Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes- 21:00 Migraine- 21:00 Frequent Urination 23:00 Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids 23:00 Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in: 21:00. ER or physician&#39;s office required: Went to urgent care 36 hours after administration. No treatment given. She just wanted to make sure no additional infection was causing anything weird. All test were negative. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): none. Events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102 were serious with criteria of medically significant, while the other events were non-serious. The outcome of the event Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling/Sore throat (Condition worsened) was unknown, the outcome of the events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102., Migraine, Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids, Frequent urination was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal association.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.
