                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

                                                Less than 1 minute after received the shot, patient became clammy and pale while sitting in chair. Her eyes rolled back in her head and her body went slack. Myself (parent) and the nurse who had given the shot braced her on either side while she appeared to fade in and out of consciousness for several minutes (she seemed to occasionally interact with us, mumbling responses to &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; questions). The nurse did not want to lower her to the floor, but wanted to keep her propped on the chair. Her head kept rolling to the side. At one point, she began to jerk rhythmically.  Just as I was about to bring this to the attention of the nurse, the patient returned to consciousness. Patient was moved to a rolling recliner chair and taken to a recovery area where I (parent) did not see her for another 30 minutes as I was receiving my own shot. The chair she had sat in was wet, but it was assumed this was due to sweat (patient had sweated profusely).  On the way out of the clinic, noticing a wet stain on the back side of patient&#39;s pants, I asked if she had wet her pants (quietly) two separate times. Patient denied it both times. However, upon returning home, patient confirmed that she had wet her pants.  Patient was monitored during the evening for similar adverse events ; none noted.  Patient ate lunch approximately 1 hour before receiving shot and was given crackers while at clinic. Patient is a well-hydrated individual, and also drank water while on-site. No fever either before or after shot. A slightly elevated BP the next day (135/83). However, patient complained of headache, fatigue, and pain at injection location; elevated BP may be related to headache and/or ordeal from day of the shot.

Video footage shows she is standing in line with other children, and just faints and falls to the floor. Initially she was not responding much to EMS and to FNP that received her, EKG was completed, and VS were within normal limits. She received lab work, UA, and CT of Head as she appeared to have hurt her head at time of fall.  Few hours later, when FNP checked on her again, about 9:50 pm, she was more responsive, answering his questions and doing much better than when she initially arrived to hospital around 8 pm. She was verbal, and VS were within normal limits during my time with her at the hospital

                                                Routine covid 19 vaccination using Pfizer requested by patient.  All screening questions were answered by patient and received the vaccination without incident.  Approximately 3 minutes after she received vaccination she came back in the professional services room with her father, as he received his vaccination she complained of becoming dizzy and was told to go have a seat in the waiting area.  She was sitting with her mother for another moment and her mom became concerned because the patient urinated on the floor while she was sitting there and seemed to lose consciousness.  We responded to the patient who was awake but was extremely pale.  Warehouse management was called over and they observed the patient and made the decision to call 911 based on the mother&#39;s concern.  Paramedics arrived within 10 minutes and recorded very low blood pressure and were concerned she may have had a seizure.  The decision was made to take the patient to the hospital because her blood pressure was still remaining low after approximately another 10 minutes.  I called the phone number on her immunization consent form the next morning (6/15/21) and again in the evening but was able only to leave a voice mail.

A 19-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0198), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm (unable to confirm if given in the muscle) on 12Jul2021 at 20:20 (at the age of 19 years old) as single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing peanut allergy diagnosed when she was 1 year old. Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol, norethisterone acetate (LOESTRAN), 1 tablet daily in the morning for 28 days for contraception from Jan2021 to an unspecified stop date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive additional vaccines on same date of the Pfizer suspect. She began to be experienced unconfirmed urinary tract infection symptoms including an urge to urinate, blood in her urine and difficulty urinating on 13Jul2021. She asking have this been reported after receiving the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine? She just took it two days ago and woke up not being able to pee and peeing blood and stated that it caused a UTI on 13Jul2021. She has never had one before in her life. This happened the night after she got the vaccine and it may be just a coincidence. Her left arm was also swollen and when she went to bathroom to pee, it was cloudy and had blood in it. She knew it had to be the vaccine because she never had that before. A couple of hours after the vaccine she noticed her left arm was swollen at injection site on 12Jul2021 at 22:00. Yesterday morning on 13Jul2021 at 08:00 she was not able to pee. It improved a bit, but she has pain and has urge. It feels like she just has to pee even though she just peed. She googled it and it said it was a UTI. She has not been formally diagnosed yet. She first stated the peeing blood started on 13Jul2021. At around 1:00 am, there was a little bit of blood when she got up to pee. She did not see any this morning, but does not know how it will be throughout the day. It has improved for now. She would like to find out if this has been reported before. The patient did not visit emergency room or physician office. No relevant tests were performed. The outcome of events was she went to bathroom to pee, it was cloudy and had blood in it, she has pain and has urge was unknown, while with other events recovering.  Follow-up attempts are completed; no further information is expected.

At around 2:15pm patient started to faint. Patient was accompanied by her mother. Rph on duty rushed to the scene noticed that patient had lost consciousness and started to have a seizure. I also noticed that the patient had passed urine while unconscious. I notified my technician to call 911. I quickly grabbed an EpiPen and administered one dose into the patient thigh. I assisted the patient along with her mother until the patient regained consciousness. Paramedic arrived to the seen few mins later. They checked all vital signs and patient was responding better and but still exhibiting some tingling effect in her hands. Patient decided not to ride with the paramedics. I advised her to stay for another 30 - 45 min so that I could monitor her. She was feeling much better and was released to go home along with a EpiPen.

                                                Ophthalmology consult was subsequently obtained with diagnosis of acute optic neuritis. First dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 4/22/2021 with onset of symptoms approximately 2 to 3 weeks thereafter. Bilateral vision loss 2/2 optic neuritis that is new. Initially involving only the right eye, transient improvement with Solu-Medrol approximately 1 month prior to admission, but with recurrence and later with development of vision loss in the left eye as well for approximately 1 week prior to admission. Unclear etiology.  MS felt less likely with negative oligoclonal bands, NMO antibody negative, though per neuro, still potential for neuromyelitis optica, MOG 1:40.  Also consideration that may be a complication of having received COVID-19 vaccine, though relationship remains unclear. 2-3 weeks prior to symptoms patient received vaccine. Short time after was also diagnosed with Mono and UTI. Got IV methylprednisolone of 1 g daily x4 doses without significant improvement.   Then required total plasma exchange over 2 weeks, resulted in mild symptom improvement. CDC reports optic neuritis may be related to vaccinations in general (52.4% of cases within 8 weeks of vaccination). No evidence for COVID vaccines at this time. Added Pfizer vaccine to allergy list per neuro recommendations.

Over the next several days she had migraines, fever, nausea, diarrhea.  She had a very heavy period that was not normal for her.  She was treated twice for presumed UTI (once with macrobid and then with cefuroxime) in the days after the vaccine though cultures ended up negative.  She was referred to me, a hematologist, when she was noted to have a dropping hemoglobin and platelet count.  She appears to have a Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and possibly ITP.  She is feeling a little better but her labs remain abnormal.  Please note this was reported on Pfizer website as well but I have not been contacted.  Guidance would be sincerely appreciated.  My cell phone was provided.

Outcome of all the events  was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  Coombs negative hemolytic anemia and other events  due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I began to have paresthesias in my lower extremities, which progressed to saddle anesthesia over about a week?s time. I then developed acute urinary retention. I could also not have a bowel movement at that time. In the ER, I was cathed and they also performed an enema, believing I was constipated but nothing came out, leading me to believe that it was a loss of nerve function. They also performed an emergency MRI which showed no nerve compression (ruling out cauda equina syndrome). I left because I believed I could urinate at home. I was not able to urinate until mid morning the next day. After this, I was seen by a neurologist who believed I may have multiple sclerosis. However, my work up came back negative. At the same time, the paresthesias continued to ascend into my hands and I could not sit due to overwhelming pain and saddle anesthesia/LE parenthesis. As this began to resolve, I woke up from sleep multiple times in a row for 3 nights gasping for air because I stopped breathing spontaneously (even with sitting up and changing positions). I recovered after this symptom resolved and have been completely fine since. I am a PA student and I truly believe that I had a Guillian Barre type reaction to the vaccine.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height.

                                                Minutes right after the vaccination, I had burning in my left eye, like a nerve in my head burning.  I was offered Tylenol by the pharmacist, which I denied.  When I stood up, I got really light headed.  I went back to work anyways and the symptoms lasted for 2 hours.  I came home and noticed my left butt cheek started to ache and feel sore.  I  did not take any medications.  I went to bed and woke up with full blown flu like symptoms- extremely weak, fatigued, body aches and soreness, muscle stiffness, headache,  intermitten light headedness, and left eye could not focus properly. These symptoms lasted for about 24 hours and most went away, however I was still unable to focus with my left eye. On 6/5/2021  I had a very bad explosive severe headache,  I had loss of balance, loss of vision in left eye and could not speak coherently and decided to go to the ER.  In the car en route to ER, I felt like I was paralyzed and could not move.   I was diagnosed with migraines, given a RX for Compazine, and to follow up with the PCP.  I went to the doctor on 6/7/2021 with extreme fatigue, difficulty walking and balance, light headed and left eye focusing issues.  I was referred to an opthamologist.  On 6/8/2021 I went to the opthamologist and had an eye exam and retinal screening and was referred to a better hospital.  On 6/9/2021 I went to a hospital to be seen by an opthamologist and neurologist and I did lots of blood work,  an MRI of my head, neck and brain  which showed my optic nerve was swelling and causing my brain to swell as well.  I was diagnosed with inflammation of the optic nerve.   I am being followed up by the neurologist.  I have been having intermitten  episodes of severe headaches and would have body paralysis for about 30 minutes and it  would go away.  I am having these episodes about once a week.  Every time I have an episode, I would go see my doctor who would run more tests.  I have been tested for epilepsy which is negative.

This improved approximately 11 hours after it started. 12 hours later she noted cola colored urine. Was evaluated today and urine improving in color and now a light pink color. Urine positive for protein and blood. Menses did finish a few days ago. CBC, CMP, ESR results pending.

I had chills, cough, nausea, body aches,  loss of appetite , shortness of breath , accelerated heart, and chest pain.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

                                                Presented to ED today with complaint of emesis onset this morning. Pt received her second dose of her Covid vaccine on 5/3. Endorses hx of DKA. Denies hitting head, fever, cough, dysuria, nausea, dizziness. She is initially called a sepsis alert secondary to SIRS criteria although I do not think she likely is septic as she has no other illness symptoms but rather either DKA or dehydration from vomiting from viral illness or her history of gastroparesis.  Patient was treated with Benadryl Reglan fluid bolus Rocephin as part of the sepsis protocol and has had improvement in condition. The patient is given IV fluids along with antibiotics for what appears to be a UTI.  She will be admitted to the CDU for ongoing observation and management of her blood sugar as well as her mental status. She has Reglan and Zofran at home but was given refills. She has follow-up with gastro.

Went to doctor, they found blood and protein in my urine. The blood was visible for the next 3 days. Urine was sent for culture. Came back clean. 3 week prior, had physical penal done, bodily functions were in great shape. Last November I ever had ultrasound on my kidneys, nothing came back. I was sent to urologist,, blood was still present then. Then sent to Prime Diagnostic for CT scan. Waiting to hear back for that result.
