Medical work up has been thorough and has resulted negatively, including blood work, UDS, CT Head. She has remained slightly tachycardic, though she has also been moving continuously for several hours. Her physical exam is notable for several indicators of psychogenic origin, including demonstrating variability in tremor frequency (head, legs and arms vacillating it variable rates over time), distractability from motor tasks (head or arms stop shaking when asked to focus on moving her legs, for example). Her speech has also been affected, but this is also variable and she is at times using only 1 word sentences and other times responding more completely. Certainly she may have suffered a psychological stress today as she is fearful of needles and has a history of vasovagal response and her mother notes recent overwhelm with school performance, though this is not unusual for her. If medical work up continues to be negative, it may be reasonable to conclude she is suffering a conversion disorder  &#34;FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Conversion reaction after a Covid 19 vaccine.
