She was tested for COVID and discharged home and instructed to take acetaminophen.  On 4/20, she returned to the ED with continued complaints including abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.  She also complained of dizziness when she stands, and that her skin and eyes were jaundiced.  The patient was hypotensive and was not responding to IV fluids.  She was started on vasopressors.  She was found to be in acute liver and kidney failure.  She was emergently intubated and ended up being transferred to hospital.  Due to the nature of her condition, the above therapies were continued and CRRT was started due to acidosis.  A bicarb drip was started and was continuous.  Arrangements were made to transfer the patient to hospital once stable enough.  It was thought that she was in HLH.  She was also empirically started on hydrocortisone, later changed to dexamethasone.  She was started on antibiotics - cefepime, Flagyl, and vancomycin. She has now been transferred to hospital.  Outcome unknown at this time.  4/22

                                                Patient felt faint nearly immediately after but said she wasn&#39;t having problems breathing.   She was told to breath deeply and she quickly started feeling &#34;a little better&#34; so she was helped to a chair with arm rests in the room.  She said she had an orange in her bag, so she started eating her orange.  Just a minute later she said she was going to pass out, so the pharmacist caught her.  He held her up in the chair and tried to revive her for a few moments but noticed that the blood was draining from her face and her lips were turning blue so yelled for one of his technicians to call 911 and the other to grab an epi pen.  He then lowered her to the floor in case he needed to begin to resuscitate while the technician brought him the epipen.  While lowering her she urinated on herself.  As the pharmacist went to check her vitals before administering the epipen and beginning cpr if necessary the patient suddenly gasped once and her eyes opened widely, but not continue to breath.  Upon inspection in her mouth there was a piece of orange near the bottom of the throat.  The pharmacist asked if she was choking and she did not response at all, but did not start visibly breathing either.  So the pharmacist swiped the piece of orange out quickly, in case it was either previously lodged or patient would have to be resuscitated.  She did not seem to enjoy this and this seemed to wake her up and she quietly gasped not choking.  She started to quickly improve and admitted that she was feeling better, and had passed out before after getting blood drawn but never after a shot so didn&#39;t mention this.  While this was happening a police office was going through the drive through so the technician called him in for assistance and he arrived around this time.  He asked her a few questions like &#34;what&#39;s her name, who&#39;s president, how many quarters are in a dollar&#34; which she was able to answer.  She said she was mostly embarrassed and was feeling much better.  She sat up in the chair again about the time the emts came in.  The checked her out, but she didn&#39;t want to go to the Emergency Room.  She was driven home by her father.  I called her later around 6 pm that night and she said she was feeling totally fine and I advised her to please call her PCP and discuss this incident with him or her.

She says she did not do any treatment that night, she thought the fever would run its course. Caller says that the next day she had severe fatigue, shortness of breath, wheezing, runny nose and eyes, and she also started to fall down stairs and had muscle weakness. She says she had blurred and double vision, and ringing in her ears. She says she progressed from that in a week to having urinary incontinence, intermittent frequency at night, flank pain, and an inability to control her temperature. She says she was having hot or cold sweats and chills which continued quite a while.  She also reported that she has gained back muscle control, though she still has days where she is extremely weak, and her dizziness comes and goes. She says that the ear ringing has stayed the same, and her shortness of breath has stayed the same. She says that as of Mar 2nd she has been diagnosed with severe asthma, and she has never had any type of asthma or breathing problems before.

Clinical outcome of the event inability to work was not recovered, while clinical outcome of all other events was unknown. Laboratory data included pulmonary function test, result: 40%.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Inability to work is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A 42-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered on arm left on 15Mar2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization at the pharmacy. Medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant (including at the time of vaccination). On 16Mar2021 13:15, she came around to feeling really something bad in her body. She described this as she had loss of consciousness (fainting) which started to feel like blurry vision and then she lost her senses. She then passed out for 5-8 minutes and she had loss of sphincter control (urinary incontinence) as she pissed on herself. She also had tachycardia and mental confusion by that time. They called an ambulance and she was brought to the emergency or urgency department/room. The events [loss of consciousness (fainting), loss of sphincter control (urinary incontinence), tachycardia and mental confusion] were considered as serious (medically significant). She also had several diarrhea (noted in 2021) episodes during one week. She had no COVID prior vaccination and not tested post vaccination. She would like to know if the reaction that she had with first dose vaccination was normal as she was afraid of the second one. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events of loss of consciousness (fainting), loss of sphincter control (urinary incontinence), tachycardia and mental confusion. Outcome of the event of diarrhea was unknown while recovering for the remaining events.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

She felt feverish, chills that night but did not check temperature. Over next few days, she developed increasing generalized body aches, joint aches, headaches, weakness, fatigue. On 1/21/21 pt noted SOB and chest tightness, so she reported to  ED. She checked her pulse ox and was 99%, was tachycardic to 140-150. She takes propranolol for essential tremor, so she took propranolol 40 mg PO x 1 and presented to ED on 1/21/21.  In ED, pt was no longer tachycardic. Pt also states her concern for blood clot (mother had DVT in her 30s). She presented with moderate chest pain and tightness, as well as headache, weakness, SOB. Pt given APAP 1000 mg PO x 1, ibuprofen 800 mg PO x 1, orphenadrine 100 mg PO x 1. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL x 1 ordered, but not given on MD&#39;s orders. Pt discharged home.  1/22/21: Pt f/u with hospital. DO says her elevated WBX and Cr were likely d/t vaccine and dehydration. DO offered to schedule f/u BMP and CBC on Monday 1/25. Pt also scheduled for outpt fluids at infusion center on Monday 1/25 in case BMP and CBC still indicate dehydration.

                                                Got it yesterday at noon, totally fine until 10pm.  Worsening chills until midnight, then complete body ache, muscles, joints, everything, terrible headache.  Was on couch and walked upstairs.  By the time I got there, I was nearly vomiting and on the verge of losing consciousness.  I laid down on the cold tiles and tried to stay conscious. I couldn&#39;t even talk.  Saliva was pouring out of my mouth uncontrollably.  After awhile it let up enough to scoot into the bedroom and climb into bed.  Then an entire night of worsening chills, fever, aches, eye pain, sore throat, pulsating ringing in my ears.  Little if any sleep. I tried to get up and sit in a chair this morning at 3am and within minutes was so nauseated and light headed I had to lay back down flat. Tried to drink some hot tea and Gatorade at 5am.  Thought I heard someone walking around the house and then realized it was heartbeat pounding in my ears.  This morning my feet are super sensitive, I have urinary frequency and urgency, and the pulsatile tinnitus is back.  Later today had episode of sharp chest pains front to back that resolved after about five minutes.  Treatment has been rest today.

A 45-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 04Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history ongoing included sickle cell trait (diagnosed as a child, sickly as a child, found out in 2016. It was reported that patient has the sickle cell that mimics the disease), ongoing high blood pressure, and ongoing genital herpes, and pre-diabetes, all diagnosed prior to vaccination, and &#39;blood pressure&#39;. Concomitant medication included chlorthalidone from 2018 and ongoing for &#39;blood pressure&#39;. It was reported that patient got her first dose of Covid vaccine on 04Jan2021. Patient stated that she has been experiencing some effects, started maybe 2 days after, she began experiencing fatigue (06Jan2021). Patient also stated that she has genital herpes diagnosed before the vaccine, and stated that she usually doesn&#39;t have an outbreak unless there is extreme stress on body. On 08Jan2021, patient clarified she experienced a genital herpes outbreak and thought that it may associated. Patient stated that she treated it with valaciclovir (VALTREX) and some cream and it went away. States that she had another outbreak after, treated it again, and it went away and now she is struggling with another outbreak of genital herpes. Patient also reported that she has on and off headaches (also reported as intermittent headaches) on 04Jan2021, states this could be due to her high/increased blood pressure which she first experienced on 14Jan2021 (as reported). Patient mentioned that her blood pressure has been higher than it ever has been after the vaccine. Patient also stated that she noticed that after the vaccine it was out of control, that she got a blood pressure cuff and it was 149/103, she contacted her nephrologist, stated she is treating it with her usual diuretic and the doctor just prescribed her amlodipine (NORVASC). Patient further stated that she is still struggling to get the diastolic blood pressure in the 90s, stated this is abnormal for her. Also is experiencing severe hip pain bilateral on 08Jan2021 after the vaccine. Patient further reported that she was a little over weight - usually about 150 sometimes 162 around this time she was 162. Patient clarified that her current weight is 159.2 and stated that she was diagnosed with sickle cell trait and stated that she has the kind that mimics the disease and will have a lot of side effects of sickle cell disease. Patient further added that she also has stage 3 kidney failure on 18Jan2021 due to either her high blood pressure or sickle cell trait and is also pre-diabetic. Patient also thought that the outbreak was associated with stress on body. Patient wanted to know if she refuses the second vaccine, if the first vaccine will do anything. Outcome of the events &#39;Stage 3 kidney failure&#39;, &#39;High/Increased blood pressure&#39;, &#39;Outbreak of genital herpes&#39;, and &#39;on and off headaches/Intermittent headache&#39; was not recovered, outcome of the event &#39;extreme fatigue&#39; was recovered on 06Jan2021, outcome of the event &#39;hip pain bilateral&#39; was recovering, outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stage 3 kidney failure was due to either the pre-existing high blood pressure or sickle cell trait or prediabetic condition, and was unrelated to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).

                                                In discussion with Dr., medical director at Detox, she  arrived night of 2/3/21 was quite intoxicated so was not going through any  withdrawal.  She was getting vitals and CIW  checked regularly.  First dose of  chlordiazepoxide 25mg was 2/4 at 1:25pm for CIWA 9.  She had repeat vitals at  5:50pm, CIWA 1, vitals: P 67, 118/79, 94% on RA, T 98.3.  she had complained of  some &#34;pressure in her head&#34; and feeling anxious, but otherwise denied other  complaints.  she was talking with others in the group, then other patients report  she suddenly started having seizure like activity around 6:45pm, med techs came  to help and found her stiff, gurgling.  they tried to get vitals on her, called  911, noticed that at 6:54pm she had lost a pulse and they started CPR.  paramedics arrived at 7:08pm and she was brought to ED.   Pt BIBA in cardiac arrest. Pt was at Detox Center when she  was reported to have seizure-like activity followed by collapse. She  was found to be pulseless and CPR initiated by staff members. EMS  arrived and performed approx 15 min of CPR and gave pt epi x 3 and  bicarb. No shocks administered but they did not report a rhythm.   In the emergency room the patient arrived and was found to be pulseless with PEA arrest, CPR was initiated, patient was intubated. ROSC ultimately achieved, patient remained very acidotic despite ventilator adjustment, head CT revealed cerebral edema. Pt also found to be profoundly anemic with a hemoglobin of 5 and platelets of 37, she was thought to be GI bleeding so medications for this were initiated. Patient then became more hypoxemic with bradycardia, consultation with neurosurgery and critical care medicine at tertiary care center deemed ongoing CPR futile. Patient arrested at 2:30AM on 2/5, pronounced dead at 2:48AM.

                                                acute right flank pain and difficulty breathing a few minutes after vaccine.  Onset was quick and within 5 minutes of initial flank pain, I was unable to take a full breath in.  It felt as if someone was stabbing my right flank - bra level - and taking a breath in was very difficult.  minor relief was experienced when leaning forward and applying tension (I was leaning forward and pressing my arms against the seat of the chair to apply tension to the area.  I was unable to sit straight, stand, walk or move very well without acute stabbing pain in my flank.  I was transported by ambulance to the emergency room where I was told that I has a minor UTI and had &#34;pulled a muscle.&#34;  This &#34;alleged&#34; pulled muscle happen while I was sitting perfectly still in a waiting area on a conference.  As a note, I am not nervous of injections or of the vaccine.  I was feeling great before, during and immediately after the injection until the pain began.   At onset, I felt an intense heat at the injection site that radiated throughout my upper arm around the injection site followed by uncomfortable flank pain and shortness of breath.  Within minutes, the flank pain became acute and it was difficult to catch a full breath without pain - likely due to the acute flank pain.  I was released from the emergency room at approximately 3:00pm with a prescription for antibiotics for the UTI and muscle relaxers..

CBC and CMP clinically unremarkable with no elevation of white blood cell count.  HOWEVER, urine with 388 white cells/36 red cells/few bacteria and positive leukocyte esterase/nitrites. Chest x-ray without abnormalities. EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 108.  No acute ST or T abnormalities.  No ectopy. Renal ultrasound showed a non-obstructing stone in the kidney, but no hydronephrosis. COVID and Respiratory Panel were all negative.  ER COURSE: Patient had already be given IV fluids/Tylenol/morphine prior to my evaluation and was feeling slightly better, but was still having generalized body aches and malaise... Blood cultures were drawn, and IV Rocephin was given.  A second dose of morphine and Benadryl was needed to get the patient somewhat comfortable, but was still having severe body aches and malaise  MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: Initial thought was adverse reaction to COVID vaccine,  but patient also with significant UTI, febrile, and severe body pain requiring multiple doses of IV narcotics for control... Question of adverse reaction to vaccine and or UTI/early pyelonephritis or combination of both...  Hospitalist was consulted to evaluate the patient... Will admit for observation status and continued IV medications. Date of hospitalization = 4/24/2021

A 45-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number EW0150 and expiration date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 05Apr2021 15:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing Hypertension (Patient diagnosed in her late 30&#39;s), ongoing Hypothyroid (Patient diagnosed when she was around 20 years old), ongoing Allergies, ongoing Gastrooesophageal reflux disease (The patient was exposed to a chemical in her 20&#39;s that caused this condition), ongoing Birth control, ongoing Allergic to eggs (States patient has never received the flu vaccine due to her egg allergy), and ongoing Allergic to shellfish.

On 06Apr2021 13:00, the reporter stated that her daughter fainted at work, lost her urine, and was unconscious and was taken to the Emergency Room. Primary Care Physician told her daughter she should have no problem getting the second vaccine. States that she was not certain if her daughter should get the second shot. It was scheduled for next week. Also, reported that after lunch reporter stated that her daughter fainted in her office at work. She had urinated on herself and was unconscious. Caller was concerned it could have been a seizure. Her daughter was taken to the Emergency Room and they diagnosed her as having a Syncopal Episode. On 06Apr2021, the patient had headaches that continue since these events. The reporter stated that her daughter&#39;s doctor told her daughter that the blood work and electrocardiogram done at the Emergency Room were normal. The Emergency Room and her daughter&#39;s doctor acted like her symptoms were not serious. The reporter looked at the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System website and it said that a syncopal episode is a reportable event. Says that her daughter&#39;s doctors did not report this event. Says doctors need to have training on the importance of reporting events. The reporter called the Food and Drug Administration last week but she hasn&#39;t heard anything from them. States they told her it could take 5-7 business days. Says she called Pfizer today to see if there was any further information or guidance she could get as she is concerned about her daughter.

They took her to the ER around 1 pm the day after her vaccination and diagnosed her with a syncopal episode stating that they didn&#39;t think it was from the shot. The events syncope, urinary incontinence, seizure, and headache were considered as serious (medically significant) by the reporter. The events syncope, and urinary incontinence caused emergency room visit and physician office visit. The outcome of the events syncope, urinary incontinence was recovered on 06Apr2021.  The outcome of the event Headache was not recovered. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a causal association between the reported events and bnt162b2 cannot be fully excluded.Case will be reassessed when additional information is available.

Headache,  Left foot/heel pain/ weak knees, fatigue/temp 100 , left flank pain and bladder incontinence over night.   Headache continued during the day and evening of 2/10/21,   I also did have some transient pins/needles to both hands after dose 1 but thought it was related to sleeping position....then this developed after 2nd dose and I started becoming concerned this was a neurological/nerve related side effect of vaccination.

A 49-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EW0150 and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Apr2021 (at the age of 49 years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization at doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. Medical history included on von willebrand&#39;s disease and sulfa drug allergy. Other medications received by the patient within 2 weeks of vaccination (concomitant medications) was vitamin-D 50,000 IU per week and vitamin-C (ascorbic acid) 1000 IU. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6206 and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 49 years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant at the vaccination time. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Two days after the vaccination (14Apr2021), the patient had severe abdominal pain and could not urinate for 8.5 hours before going to emergency room (ER). The liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 1,599 (units not reported) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 17,655 (units not reported). Six hours later even higher with ALT 4,359 (units not reported) and AST 4,755 (units not reported). Computerized tomography (CT) and all other liver tests and organ tests were completely normal. The patient was hospitalized for these events. The patient was consistent with medication toxicity and was treated for it (only new med the patient took was COVID vaccine - liver enzymes were checked 6 weeks prior at routine appointment and were completely normal) with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) every 4 hours, potassium and fluids. The patient was discharged on 19Apr2021 with a duration of 5 days after supportive care and enzymes consistently going down. The current AST was 34 (units not reported) and ALT was 377(units not reported). These adverse events results in ER visit or urgent care facility. The outcome of these events was recovering at the time of report.

                                                Got booster shot on Wednesday the 20th, came home and was fatigued. Thursday had horrible headache that would not be relieved with tylenol. I took a plane and arrived at 1130 pm. I went to bed shortly after arriving at my daughters house. Friday morning, I was unable to be woken up and my daughter called 911. I was in a coma. I suffered cardiac arrest during a CT to check for clots. I was resuscitated and put on life support. CT scan for clots, strokes, heart attacks were all clear. I was admitted to the C-ICU and on life support, on the ventilator, and was on 3 different medications at max dosage to keep my blood pressure barely surviving. The doctors told my daughter not to expect me to survive because they had no idea why I was suddenly so ill.  A doctor then told my daughter that my kidneys were failing, and my liver was damaged.  I also developed a high fever and had a high white blood cell count. They gave me Vancomycin and another antibiotic, and then the next the day a kidney doctor gave me lasix to flush out all of the excess fluid. I woke up on Saturday not knowing what had happened and was completely terrified and confused. My daughter was allowed into the ICU to see me and keep me calm, thankfully. She explained to me what happened. I am still in the hospital, as they are keeping me for observation and trying to determine if my kidneys will start working properly again.  Prior to this, I have only ever had a kidney infection, and I thought before I might have had the start of a UTI.  I do have chronic high blood pressure as well, a long term side effect from open heart surgery 10 years prior for an aneurysm, but aside from that I am relatively healthy 50 year old.

                                                I had my first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on 12/23/20.  I was exposed to COVID-19 on 12/28 and positive on 1/3/21.  I had a mild infection, but my chronic constipation was resolved and had easy stooling that week.  On 1/7/21 I was having right upper quadrant abdominal pain, radiating to bilateral kidney pain and it resolved by the 8th or 9th.  I asked for a health care visit because the discomfort was strong.   I received the second dose of the COVID Pfizer vaccine on 1/13/21.  No immediate problems but intermittent pain in upper right abdomen into my kidneys.   By 1/25/21 I had constant pain in my kidneys and in general my abdomen was bloated and tender.  I thought I had a kidney infection and was prescribed abx.  By the next day the pain was becoming more severe and I went to the ER the night of 1/26.  CT showed a mass in the live and extensive stool throughout the bowel - even though I had been eating and stooling normal for me with hx of chronic constipation.  I had to stop eating and completing clean out my colon.  The swelling in the my abdomen took about 2 weeks to subside and I was unable to eat for several days.  I was diagnosed with mild diffuse fatty liver disease, which had not been previous an issue.  MRI determined I have a cyst on my ovary also.

Applied a sternal rub and eventually patient came to. Patient was very disoriented afterward and discovered patient had urinated. Patients husband was with her, but in the parking lot, brought him in. She reports a history of fainting. BP 134/87, pulse 77.

                                                I received the first Covid vaccine on 2/25/21. I had bloodwork drawn related to my yearly physical on 3/11/21. They ran a CBC and basic metabolic panel. My CBC was normal and my levels specifically my Creatinine was completely normal. I received the second vaccine on 3/18/21. On 3/20/21 I started feeling a lot of pain in my abdomen area and was feeling really bloated. I was having a little difficulty breathing. I went to my PCP on Monday 3/22/21. They ran a CBC and a basic metabolic panel again. That afternoon, my PCP sent me for a CT scan of my abdominal and pelvic area. On the morning of 3/23/21, my PCP called me my Creatinine level ran the day before was at 5. Also my CT scan had come back.  I also had moderate ascites (fluid in my abdomen).  I also had a large right pleural effusion.  On 3/23/21, my PCP sent me to the ER for hospital admission.  I was in the hospital for 12 days.  I was in acute kidney failure.  They drained the fluid from my abdomen.  They inserted a temporary port and I had 4 rounds of dialysis.  On my 9th day in the hospital, the kidney doctor started me on 80 mg of Lasix per day.  My urine output increased dramatically and my creatinine levels began to drop. I had not had any issues prior to the kidney failure that would typically cause it to happen.  The only new medicine or change had been the Covid vaccine administration.  The kidney doctor and the hospitalist dismissed this idea.  I am reporting it because it was the only thing new and my levels had been normal less than 2 weeks before.

Her doctor told her it was fine that it needed to air out. She left the bandage on too long.  She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She received the vaccine on the 29Dec2020. She tested positive 02Jan2020. The arm wasn&#39;t swollen it was just burning. She was sick to her stomach when she got the stomach. The sick to the stomach lasted maybe two days, but then she got COVID. The burning was around the arm. It wasn&#39;t that bad. It lasted for a day. It started the day she got the shot (on the 29Dec2020). On 07Jan2021, she went to the hospital because her kidneys were hurting. The doctor said her kidneys were good. They did labs which were good. She was still going through body aches. She was told she was currently in the worst part of the virus. She still had a sour stomach going on from the virus as well. The outcome of the body aches and sour stomach was not recovered, for other events was unknown.

A 52-year-old female received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 at 10:30 AM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. The patient ha d no allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination, and was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and also did not receive any other medication within two weeks of vaccination. The patient had a headache on 22Jan2021 for 5 days. She also had stomach bloating and pressure and discomfort on 22Jan2021. It was reported that when she saw blood in her urine, she went to a walk-in and was diagnosed with a UTI on 22Jan2021. She did 7 days of an antibiotic. Then on 30Jan2021, she had an abscess tooth that became infected. It was reported that the patient received antibiotics for both infections. It was reported that the events result in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and an Emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was recovering. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

Feel waves of fatigue.  Left, went home...felt hot and clammy.  Took temp- it was 101.7. Took tylenol, gabapentin, and went to sleep in recliner. Woke up at 11 pm, severe muscle weakness...so much that by the time I got out of the recliner...and on my feet...I already began to urinate on myself. It was like I could not control my body...I had very little ability to get up and out of recliner...everything was so HEAVY....my arms and legs were &#34;weighted&#34;. After using restroom...it took 15 min just to change out of soiled clothing and clean up...and re-dress.  I laid down in the bed, but was very uncomfortable...so went back to recliner. Was physically unable to get the lid off the tylenol after trying very hard....I fell back to sleep.   At 3:15 am I woke up needing to pee, and once recliner was at normal seated position...I struggled to use my arms to lift myself up...my right arm, where I got vaccine hurt badly...it felt like PAIN...like beyond sore. I pitched to floor cuz legs wouldn&#39;t hold me.  My fever was 103.7... J feel hard-pressed to finish cuz I got a warning im about to time out. Guess I hope someone contacts me. I hav

A 54-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration administered in the right arm on 25Mar2021 11:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history reported as follows: The patient has had trouble with her bladder since 2008 when she had a bladder sling put in. The patient stated that the company knew there were problems with the bladder slings, and they were still allowing the bladder slings to be put inside of people. There were times when the patient could not urinate and the bladder sling had to be cut and finally taken out of her. The doctor couldn&#39;t remove all the bladder sling because some of the bladder sling grew inside of her body. She had to wear a urinary catheter for months strapped to her leg. She had a back surgery and a doctor messed her up on the left side. Her doctor does manipulations on her back and helps her with her pain. Additionally, she had a bladder infection in Oct2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient received her first dose on 25Mar2021. The patient stated that she had a doctor&#39;s appointment for her back (medical history). The night before the appointment she was fine, but on the next day (08Apr2021) it was horrible. While she was there in the appointment, she had a urine test and her doctor found blood in her urine on 08Apr2021. She felt like she had to urinate but only a few drops of urine would come out on 08Apr2021. Her doctor told her that the last time she had a bladder infection was in Oct2020 (medical history). Since she might have a bladder or kidney infection on 08Apr2021, she was prescribed Macrobid 100mg take one every 12 hours for 7 days. She&#39;s scheduled to receive her second Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow, 15Apr2021. She wanted to know if the antibiotic will cause any problems with getting the second Covid-19 vaccine. The adverse events required a visit to the physician&#39;s office. The outcome of the adverse events was unknown.

Second dose given 04/23/21 and by 04/28/2021 I started bleeding again And by the second day I was soaking through pads and huge clots were coming out. This has never happened to me before.  After 7 days of bleeding heavily I woke up on May 5th at 4:00 a.m. with intense abdominal cramping The only way I can describe was labor. I felt back labor, pelvic pressure, frequent urination and intense pain. I reached out to my gynecologist And he immediately told me to remove my estrogen patch and later that morning he started me on progesterone treatment for 10 days to stop the bleeding. After 7 hours of pain on May 5th, I went to the emergency department and an ultrasound revealed a blood clot. From ultrasound results &#34;there is a complex area in the area of the cervix measuring 5.7 x 3.6 x 2.6 cm.&#34;   After several hours I was released from the emergency room taking toradol for pain. That evening I passed a huge blood clot!  I&#39;m very grateful it was where it was and I could expel it.  But there&#39;s no doubt the second vaccine caused this issue that has never happened to me before. I still get my periods though irregular and very light. So this event was highly unusual and very painful

                                                56 year old female presents with complaint of tingling and numbness that she noticed to her lower left jaw.  It occurred yesterday around 3 PM after she received her Covid vaccination.  She states that then started to move up to her left cheek but has now gone back down just to the lower left jaw.  It is in a specific region of that area.  She states also that she is having a fever today and generalized body aches that are moderate in nature.  She also notes some urinary frequency without dysuria or hematuria.  Patient took Tylenol this morning around 6 AM.  She initially tried to swallow the pill and felt like she was going to choke on it and spit the pill up.  She then sat down for a few minutes and was then able to take the pill.  She denies any actual stridor or wheezing.  No focal weakness or numbness of one arm or leg.  No change in speech. Differential diagnoses include but are not limited to: CVA, TIA, anxiety reaction, paresthesia, metabolic process, bleed, vaccine reaction.  56-year-old female with paresthesia to the left chin.  Otherwise normal neurologic examination.  The TPA window given symptoms started yesterday.  I will get a head CT but I do not feel the patient needs an MRI.  Given the fact the patient does have autoimmune disorder, blood cultures and lactic acid obtained.  I suspect that her fever is in response to her Covid vaccine yesterday.  Covid test negative.  Urinalysis no evidence of UTI.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Head CT negative.  On reevaluation after Motrin patient feels much improved.  At this time I think she is stable for discharge to home.  I do not think this is Bell&#39;s I am finding no facial weakness on my examination.  Follow-up and return precautions discussed patient understood

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6201; expiry: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 59-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient had no medical history, no concomitant medications and no investigation assessment. The patient experienced urinary tract infection in Mar2021 which was considered serious due to hospitalization from Mar2021 to Mar2021 for 5 days. She was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection. She didn&#39;t know who she was or what she was doing for 3 days. She was then kept an additional two days. The patient was supposed to go back on 12Mar2021 to receive the second dose. She was in the hospital at that time and did not receive the second dose. She was asking if she needed to start over since it was past the time for her to get the second dose. The event urinary tract infection required an emergency room visit. The outcome of the event urinary tract infection was recovered on 22Mar2021 while for disorientation was unknown.

A 59-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 20Apr2021 08:26 (Lot Number: ER8732) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, ongoing hypertension, ongoing mitral valve prolapse, ongoing Tarlov cysts and ongoing mobility issues and problems standing and sitting. The patient had a neurological condition caused Tarlov Cysts. These cysts populated right outside of the dorsal root nerve system. In her, it&#39;s cervical vertebra #5 all the way down her spine bilaterally. In May2018, she had a surgical procedure, not an aspiration, for 8 of the nerves in her sacrum. She has had complications ever since. Cervical vertebra #7 and #8 have been giving her the most problems.  Concomitant medications included ongoing oxycodone hydrochloride, oxycodone terephthalate, paracetamol (PERCOCET) 10mg every 4 hours taken for pain, and her doctor recently changed it; ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL) injection and something for acid reflux but she did not think that&#39;s relevant. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EN6208) in arm right on 16Mar2021 9:48AM for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 59-year-old and she had no problems just soreness in her arm. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. She had her second Covid 19 vaccine yesterday morning, 20Apr2021. Cervical vertebra #8 through Lumbar vertebra #5 was very, very painful from 20Apr2021. She didn&#39;t know or hasn&#39;t heard if the Covid 19 vaccine is associated with her back pain. This pain that she&#39;s having now didn&#39;t feel like the pain she had related to her Tarlov cysts.  Before the Covid 19 vaccine she had no problems until late last night (20Apr2021) and early this morning (21Apr2021). She was in excruciating pain. She reported it&#39;s complicated for her to make that mind adjustment. She texted her cousin this morning at 6:30AM (21Apr2021) because she had to let her cousin know what was going on. If her cousin texts and she doesn&#39;t respond, her cousin will do a welfare check. She doesn&#39;t want a welfare check so she told her cousin to just let her sleep, let her see how she feels when she&#39;s up again. She reported sometimes when the Tarlov cysts were bothering her she could lay on her back and it would soothe her pain. This time that was not working. She reported she had her vertebra and her discs and then her outer muscular system to the flank, that is where it was painful. She didn&#39;t know if this is normal. She was hearing normal side effects like tiredness and fatigue, she was not having those because she was not normal. She was 1 in 2 billion with her Tarlov cysts. She has complications with her Tarlov cysts. She has mobility issues and problems standing and sitting. She has Tarlov cysts from Cervical vertebra #5 bilaterally down. She had multiple cysts. She didn&#39;t know if the Covid 19 vaccine was aggravating her back. She reported she has 2 nervous systems, her parasympathetic and her sympathetic nervous system. She reported this is in her parasympathetic nervous system. She reported sensory, if she touches something hot, she knew it was hot. She reported this is so important. She had muscle tenderness and muscle tightness from 20Apr2021and that&#39;s it. She knew what she was taking about because she was using medical terminology. The pain felt like someone kicked her in her kidneys. The kidneys, where the waist is on her back to the top of her sacral area and up the spine to where her first rib is and go outward, that&#39;s where her pain was, from thoracic vertebra 12 to lumbar 5.  The only different thing she&#39;s done was get the Covid 19 vaccine. She was trying to triage herself. She didn&#39;t know what else to do. The Percocet was not even fixing it. She wanted to make sure the Covid 19 vaccine wasn&#39;t exacerbating her disease. She thought that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. She was in a lot of pain. Her pain was the same before and after when she took the Percocet. Normally the Percocet calmed her down to where she&#39;s functional and the Percocet was not. Percocet was 10-325mg, oxycodone and acetaminophen. Take one 4 times daily as needed for pain. The Percocet was a pharmacy bottle. In order for her to have a quality of life she also took Ketorolac or Toradol. She hadn&#39;t taken that today (21Apr2021). She picked her prescriptions up at the same time she received her Covid 19 vaccine.  She can lay on the ground on her back sometimes and her pain will be alleviated. Now laying on her back exacerbates her pain. She didn&#39;t know if it&#39;s muscular. If she was diagnosing herself, she would say it&#39;s not muscular. She knew enough about Tarlov cysts that she knew how to rule it out. She reported her felt feels like it&#39;s punching her lungs.  She reported it&#39;s so hard to explain. She&#39;s trying to separate the pain she has from her Tarlov cysts from what she&#39;s experiencing now. She reported her pain was a 10 plus in both flanks. She stated people will call flanks &#34;the sides&#34;. The only reason she knows it&#39;s a flank is because she had learn anatomy real quick with her Tarlov cysts. On the date of her first Covid 19 vaccine she had a steroid injection and a Toradol injection. With her second Covid 19 vaccine she had a Toradol injection. The pharmacist told her there would be no conflict in receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. she has to suffer through it until her pain subsides. It feels like it&#39;s kicking the heck out of her back. When she lays supine she can alleviate some of the pain associated with the Tarlov cysts but that&#39;s not working.  She can&#39;t stand or lay supine, all of that is out the window. Meaning it&#39;s not working. This pain has to be the Covid 19 vaccine. She&#39;s in a lot of pain and she didn&#39;t need the vaccine to exacerbate her pain. There were no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The adverse events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Her pupils were dilated and slow to react and she was in some respiratory distress and very diaphoretic.  At this point airway was controlled 5 oh endotracheal intubation using the glide scope and during the intubation patient was noted for copious amounts of dark brown vomitus coming from her esophagus which was guaiac positive.  Her blood pressure was low she was sedated initially with propofol etomidate was used for the intubation however because of her hypotension the propofol was slowed and she was given Versed which did seem to control her agitation and maintain her blood pressure.  Patient had IV fluid initiated wide open and CT scan was obtained of head chest abdomen pelvis given the fact that her altered mental status could be from some kind of intracerebral catastrophe and the patient&#39;s abdominal exam being unobtainable certainly possible that her GI bleeding could be from a perforated viscus.  CT scan of the brain does not demonstrate any stroke that appears to be acute however there may be some ischemia present although it may be remote and an MRI will need to be done when the patient is more stable.  CT of the chest abdomen pelvis shows what is likely an aspiration pneumonia on the right as well as a perforated viscus in her abdomen.  Radiology feels is probably somewhere in the right colon terminal ileum.  At this point the patient was given Cipro and Flagyl and that should also aid with her aspiration pneumonia.  Her blood pressure did start to decrease her temperature was noted to be elevated at 101.8.  She was given Tylenol rectally and fluids were allowed to run wide open.  Her blood pressure continued to decline and Levophed was instituted.  Case was discussed in detail with surgery and she will go to the OR immediately.  Her temperature continued to rise and was 104.5 upon transfer to the operating room as blood pressure was 78 systolic ED COURSE: o ED Course Medical decision making  Patient with altered mental status from an unknown cause.

Most of the small intestine and large intestine was affected. o Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, ICG injection for evaluation of perfusion  Indication and Consent  Findings: . Findings: Even after the ICG injection.  There was spotty tissue necrosis from mid jejunum all the way through sigmoid colon.  Most areas were blackened with a foul smell.  There was some highlighted areas secondary to the ICG but not a significant amount that would lend for an anastomosis.  Black ascites was present throughout the abdomen.  Unfortunately after much contemplation there was no surgical intervention.   Procedure  Procedure: Patient was placed in supine position.  Was intubated in the emergency room so, we were able to proceed with resuscitation through our anesthesia team.  Patient&#39;s abdomen was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Proceeded to make a midline incision.  The blood supply in the subcutaneous tissues did not even bleed.  Appeared to be darkened and almost coagulated.  As we entered through the fascia we were able to open the peritoneum between 2 hemostats.  The large rush of free air through from the abdomen.  We then proceeded to open the abdomen for the length of her incision.  This was done with electrocautery.  From here there was a black ascites present within the abdomen.  There was a large amount of dead intestine that we could immediately see.  I worked my way to the ligament of Treitz.  There was no adhesions so this was easily found.  That intestine did appear to be pink.  It lasted for about a foot.  After that area everything was either black or purple in color with a few pink spots in between.  This went all the way down to the terminal ileum where pneumatosis was visualized.  We then looked at the colon from cecum through rectum.  It appeared to be blackened as well.  Not knowing whether all of this intestine was dead or not especially with patient being hypotensive I injected ICG dye approximately 2 cc.  This was to evaluate perfusion.  Unfortunately perfusion was no better than what I could visualize.  I could not even find enough room of the colon or small intestine to make an anastomosis.  Was very hard decision, however, we did not resect any bowel.  I closed the patient&#39;s abdomen.  Patient will be taken to ICU on ventilator.  Discussed with daughter with pastor present.
