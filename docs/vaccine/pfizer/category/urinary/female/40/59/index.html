She was tested for COVID and discharged home and instructed to take acetaminophen.  On 4/20, she returned to the ED with continued complaints including abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.  She also complained of dizziness when she stands, and that her skin and eyes were jaundiced.  The patient was hypotensive and was not responding to IV fluids.  She was started on vasopressors.  She was found to be in acute liver and kidney failure.  She was emergently intubated and ended up being transferred to hospital.  Due to the nature of her condition, the above therapies were continued and CRRT was started due to acidosis.  A bicarb drip was started and was continuous.  Arrangements were made to transfer the patient to hospital once stable enough.  It was thought that she was in HLH.  She was also empirically started on hydrocortisone, later changed to dexamethasone.  She was started on antibiotics - cefepime, Flagyl, and vancomycin. She has now been transferred to hospital.  Outcome unknown at this time.  4/22

                                                Patient felt faint nearly immediately after but said she wasn&#39;t having problems breathing.   She was told to breath deeply and she quickly started feeling &#34;a little better&#34; so she was helped to a chair with arm rests in the room.  She said she had an orange in her bag, so she started eating her orange.  Just a minute later she said she was going to pass out, so the pharmacist caught her.  He held her up in the chair and tried to revive her for a few moments but noticed that the blood was draining from her face and her lips were turning blue so yelled for one of his technicians to call 911 and the other to grab an epi pen.  He then lowered her to the floor in case he needed to begin to resuscitate while the technician brought him the epipen.  While lowering her she urinated on herself.  As the pharmacist went to check her vitals before administering the epipen and beginning cpr if necessary the patient suddenly gasped once and her eyes opened widely, but not continue to breath.  Upon inspection in her mouth there was a piece of orange near the bottom of the throat.  The pharmacist asked if she was choking and she did not response at all, but did not start visibly breathing either.  So the pharmacist swiped the piece of orange out quickly, in case it was either previously lodged or patient would have to be resuscitated.  She did not seem to enjoy this and this seemed to wake her up and she quietly gasped not choking.  She started to quickly improve and admitted that she was feeling better, and had passed out before after getting blood drawn but never after a shot so didn&#39;t mention this.  While this was happening a police office was going through the drive through so the technician called him in for assistance and he arrived around this time.  He asked her a few questions like &#34;what&#39;s her name, who&#39;s president, how many quarters are in a dollar&#34; which she was able to answer.  She said she was mostly embarrassed and was feeling much better.  She sat up in the chair again about the time the emts came in.  The checked her out, but she didn&#39;t want to go to the Emergency Room.  She was driven home by her father.  I called her later around 6 pm that night and she said she was feeling totally fine and I advised her to please call her PCP and discuss this incident with him or her.

She says she had a runny nose, runny eyes, cough with taste of blood, shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, chills, and dizziness that night. She says she did not do any treatment that night, she thought the fever would run its course. Caller says that the next day she had severe fatigue, shortness of breath, wheezing, runny nose and eyes, and she also started to fall down stairs and had muscle weakness. She says she had blurred and double vision, and ringing in her ears. She says she progressed from that in a week to having urinary incontinence, intermittent frequency at night, flank pain, and an inability to control her temperature. She says she was having hot or cold sweats and chills which continued quite a while.  She also reported that she has gained back muscle control, though she still has days where she is extremely weak, and her dizziness comes and goes. She says that the ear ringing has stayed the same, and her shortness of breath has stayed the same. She says that as of Mar 2nd she has been diagnosed with severe asthma, and she has never had any type of asthma or breathing problems before.

Clinical outcome of the event inability to work was not recovered, while clinical outcome of all other events was unknown. Laboratory data included pulmonary function test, result: 40%.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Inability to work is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

Was accompanied to the bathroom. Struggled to get out of the bathroom as she was feeling so lightheaded. Was helped to a chair where she stated she felt like she was having a hard time swallowing. Was given some water. No evidence of stridor, LCTA. She explained to me while she was sitting that she has been having intermittent allergic reactions to something and last night had to take some benadryl for that. She asked if she could get some benadryl. She was given some and within a minute stated she felt fine. After waiting an additional 5 minutes she was allowed to stand and was accompanied as she walked around the clinic without further complaint.

                                                About 15 mins after vaccine I felt a sudden onset of lightheadedness and feeling as if i would pass out, told the nurse  I was going to throw up.  I was given zofran and Dr monitored Vs.  I continued to experience waves of dizzyness, nausea, abdominal pain. Shaking followed (I felt so cold), along with frequent need to urinate and urgency to have a BM (loose) for several hours.  I was given fluids and monitored.  They gave Ativan 0.5mg 2.5 hrs later?  I was discharged home at 8:45p.m. by Dr  and told not to get the 2nd Vaccine.  Symptoms continued and worsened on day 3 with Shortness of breath, chest pain and tingling in my arms that spread to my legs, back and neck. The first week I could barley walk and was seen in the ER 2 times for chest pain, shortness of breath, dizzyness, tingling, heart racing, diarrhea, nausea, muscle weakness, insomnia due to shortness of breath (gasping) with heart racing, &amp; unable to control my body temperature.  Given Prednisone 40mg which exasperated symptoms.  1/13/21 In ER and given Benadryl 3 bags of fluids, potassium and sodium. Postural tachycardia was noticed.  Referral to Neurologist.High D-dimer at  ER on 1/16/21 CT scan performed to rule out blood clot in lungs. Reffered to Cardiologist. Metoprolol and Colchicine was started in Jan by Cardiologist Dr .  Weekly visits with Dr for the first couple months.  More meds started to decrease inflammation. Furthur referrals to Immunologist, infectious disease, and Rheumotology.  At 3 months worsening of tingling in my neck and headaches/burning that felt like shocks and shooting down neck and ears.  Neurologist performed 3 view MRI to rule out transverse Myelitis. In ER early April for new onset of Petechiae, CBC labs normal. Immunologist states he felt i experienced an allergic reaction followed by secondary anaphalaxis.  He is testing me for Mast cell activation syndrome (not diagnosed yet).  Now almost 4 months later still unable to work.  Waiting results to rule out POTS.  Currently battle daily fatigue, chest pressure/pain, lung SOB, heavyness/pressure, with any exertion.  I am limited with daily walking/normal activities.  Symptoms that come and go are tingling, nausea, diarrhea, flushing of frequent urination, neck pain, regulating temperature.

After 10 hours of administration, I started vomiting throughout that night until the next morning I vomited 7 times. At 11 hours after administration I began with involuntary movements, to shake a lot. It gave me a fever of 40 degrees. The next day I couldn&#39;t get up. Body pain, I got dizzy from just walking, and I couldn&#39;t urinate, I had pain in the ovaries and pelvis area. That day that was the next, I continued vomiting and I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. I was given a saline solution for dehydration, and I took phenergan 50mg for vomiting. 36 hours later my hips and back and legs ached. At 48 hours I started diarrhea which to this day I continue with them (5 days after the vaccine). After 5 days of the vaccination I continue with diarrhea, I have controlled them with imodium and probiotics, I have a weak body, I get dizzy at times, and I continue with pain in the ovaries like menstruation that at the moment is not supposed to be because I was menstruating just 3 days before the vaccination. My body feels strange, my hips, back and head still hurt, and I continue with stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea. Medications were administered at home.

                                                On March 6, 2021 when I received my first injection of the Pfizer Covid vaccine, I immediately began to feel sick about 5 minutes afterwards. I had instant dizziness, flush feeling, tired, weak and a little nauseated.  When I got home I immediately laid down because I felt like I was going to pass out. I slept the rest of the day. Those exact symptoms lasted from March 6, 2021- March 13th, 2021. They began to dissipate the evening of the 13th. I thought all the symptoms were gone but I began urinating blood on March 18, 2021 and I haven&#39;t stopped as of yet. I have had constant kidney paid, leg soreness and cramping, dizziness, low blood pressure, chronic pain in my hands and feet, constant fatigue, intermittent headaches, loss of weight, loss of appetite, pain with urination due to the blood. I had a hysterectomy in 2016 so this is not an issue of a heavy period, I no longer have a uterus.

A 41-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm on 08Jun2021 at 13:00 (at the age of 41-year-old) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol. She did not take a medicine for that. It was genetic and runs in her family. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Caller was a consumer calling on behalf of his wife. Patient was present for this call. She was having a serious side effect from the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. Wife reported that she received the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 08Jun2021 Tuesday at 13:00. Wife reported was getting home around 15:00 and went to shower. At around 14:30 she started to feel tired and her body felt warm. She was really really tired and can&#39;t stand up. It started when she came home after the vaccine. She got hungry and started shaking and it was hard to breathe again. She reported, she began to feel tired, did not feel well at all, took a nap and also felt chilled. She stated she didn&#39;t check her temperature. She reported she thought she would feel better the next day, but she felt worse. She stated she checked her temperature and had a fever, so she took some Tylenol. She reported she still felt tired. She reported that last Friday (11Jun2021 at 10:30) in the morning when she woke up, she felt like she did not know how to breathe and my stomach was tight. On Friday 4 days later (on 11Jun2021) she developed shortness of breath, It was about the same. She used brown bags to inhale and exhale and they didn&#39;t work. Husband reported, his wife started to feel short of breath, her body started tingling and was numb It started last Friday 11Jun2021 morning at around 10:30, the end of her hand cramped up. Her two hands cramped. It happened 3 or 4 times which was why they called the ambulance. He stated that was serious and we had to call an ambulance. He reported that the medic came and checked her temperature and oxygen and said she had no problem, and it was an anxiety attack. Husband reported he did not know why she had this as she had never had before now. She has had no anxiety problems or mental problems in her life. The doctor said to breathe slowly and relax. The hand cramps happen 4 or 5 times a day, and she had to try relaxing a little bit. It will calm her body shaking but she still had shortness of breath. Husband reported that after the medic left, she was still feeling uncomfortable about an hour later and they went to urgent care where the doctor reported she might had respiratory alkalosis. Caller reported that the doctor didn&#39;t do any blood tests but gave her hydroxyzine 50 mg for allergies and maybe she had a panic/anxiety attack that put her to sleep. She went to sleep and felt better, but as soon as she woke up she would shake and the shortness of breath would came back. She woke up hungry and weak, and when she had some food she will feel a little better but was not breathing well. Husband stated that was okay for 2 days. He reported that on Saturday (12Jun2021), they went to family doctor for check-up. That doctor also thinks she had an anxiety attack and gave her anxiety medication alprazolam 2.25 mg and gave her something for heartbeat and also propranolol for a racing heartbeat. The hydroxyzine, alprazolam, and propranolol are in amber colored pharmacy bottles. Alprazolam expiration date was Feb2022, Propranolol expiration date was Sep2022. She saw the doctor today. She was taking that medicine for her heart. Husband stated a medicine to slow down heartbeat. Husband reported she had a severe attack Monday (14Jun2021) again and went to the ER. He reported the hospital gave her lab tests to check on body and physically everything looked okay to them. He reported they did x-ray of lungs and organs and nothing seems wrong. He stated seems weird. Husband reported they went to family doctor again today (16Jun2021) and took more medication. The doctor advised wife to go to a psychiatrist. Husband reported they went there, and psychiatrist did assessment and thinks she did not have psych problems as psych problems wont give her fever and she reportedly had 11 days of fever until now. He stated, it did not go away, no one can help her, they had anxiety pill on their hands but nothing was helping her breathing, they did not understand what causes this. Wife reported her whole body started shaking every morning when she woke up and sometimes in the afternoon she started shaking again and took anxiety medication. Husband asked why the doctor did not give her breathing medication? We had inhaler but it did not help. Earlier they went to saw psychiatrist and the psychiatrist asked them to call pfizer to guide them what to do. Husband states we went to 3 different physical doctors and went to psychiatrist and it&#39;s not psych problem, psych problem won&#39;t give fever. They went to different departments and they had no idea what to do. They want to find out more about it. They seek help from different doctors but they did not have solution. Wife reported her temperatures around 100.6F, 100.5F, 100.1F, and 99 something. Wife stated a lot of time it was 99 something. She had the fever again the next day on 09Jun2021. Last night her temperature was 100.4 or 100.5, and this morning it was 99 something. She had not taken Tylenol yet. She didn&#39;t feel good at all. She felt cold and then was hot the next day. She felt really tired and checked her temperature. Her fever had continued for 11 days now. She took Tylenol before bed and it brought it back to normal 98 or 97. She went to the hospital on Monday (on 16Jun2021) and they said she probably had a urine infection. Today the family doctor gave her some antibiotics. Her stomach felt tight when she started getting shortness of breath. It was tight like she didn&#39;t know how to breathe. She felt like throwing up sometimes. It started Friday. When she came back after the shot she was weary and tired, chilly, sleepy, and her hands hurt. Then she couldn&#39;t breathe. She stated they didn&#39;t go anywhere this whole year not even grocery store, they shop online. They only went in the backyard that&#39;s it. Her first time was to get vaccine. Caller&#39;s question was if these symptoms have been reported before and what should they do? He read the description on the product and none of that what she experienced. She went to her family doctor and to the ER. She went to so many different doctors and also a psychiatrist with no solution. His wife was experiencing shortness of breath and her whole body was shaking. He asked if Pfizer has heard anything about these side effects before. Reporter seriousness for events reported as unspecified. The events resulted in emergency room and physician office visit. Patient was not hospitalised. Outcome of events I don&#39;t know how to breathe/short of breath, whole body shaking,  her body started tingling and was numb, The end of her hand cramped up, She reports she began to feel tired/she was weary and tired, didn&#39;t feel well at all, had a fever, racing heart beat, feels like throwing up, hands hurt, body felt warm was not recovered and outcome of other events was unknown.

A 42-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered on arm left on 15Mar2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization at the pharmacy. Medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant (including at the time of vaccination). On 16Mar2021 13:15, she came around to feeling really something bad in her body. She described this as she had loss of consciousness (fainting) which started to feel like blurry vision and then she lost her senses. She then passed out for 5-8 minutes and she had loss of sphincter control (urinary incontinence) as she pissed on herself. She also had tachycardia and mental confusion by that time. They called an ambulance and she was brought to the emergency or urgency department/room. The events [loss of consciousness (fainting), loss of sphincter control (urinary incontinence), tachycardia and mental confusion] were considered as serious (medically significant). She also had several diarrhea (noted in 2021) episodes during one week. She had no COVID prior vaccination and not tested post vaccination. She would like to know if the reaction that she had with first dose vaccination was normal as she was afraid of the second one. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events of loss of consciousness (fainting), loss of sphincter control (urinary incontinence), tachycardia and mental confusion. Outcome of the event of diarrhea was unknown while recovering for the remaining events.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

On Saturday, 13Feb2021, she woke up and had burning with urination and it was burning every time she urinated. Thought she had a UTI and maybe her body couldn&#39;t fight the infection because of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient went to urgent care. Took a urine sample that showed a high level of blood and leukocytes in her urine. There were no nitrates in her urine, which usually indicates a UTI. She was prescribed antibiotics Bactrim, standard dose(was unable to provide the exact strength ) as a Treatment for the adverse events but clarified that gave her no relief. No ndc/lot/exp to provide but has the Packaging sealed and intact. Got results back of urine culture and there is no UTI. She is not taking the antibiotic anymore. Still have pain when urinating. Still having lower abdominal and back pain. Feels like her organs are inflamed and swollen. Has a doctor&#39;s appointment on Thursday to follow up with her primary care. Thinking it could be a coincidence, but feels like she wouldn&#39;t be in this if she didn&#39;t have the COVID-19 Vaccine. She is concerned with the dull aching pain and also with a couple sharp pains yesterday. She feels pain when she urinates and as the day goes on, it gets worse. The caller asked if soreness and dull aching pain in her lower abdomen and painful urination a reported side effect of the COVID vaccine? Concerned if she should take the second dose, that something is going on, and if the COVID-19 Vaccine triggered it. Wants feedback. Outcome for the inflammation was recovered and other events were reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Noted that symptoms began about 1 week after second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Symptoms initially started with moderate hot flashes, constant migraine headache.  Symptoms progressed to substernal chest pain that is somewhat positional however now has become constant.  Pain radiation to right neck.  Noticed decreased exercise tolerance such as walking moderate distances made her extremely sweaty.   Went to ER on 6/29/21 after first being seen by primary doctor and found of ST depressions and was found abnormal EKG, normal D-dimer, troponin negative, placed in the rapid cardiology follow-up list.    Went to ER on 7/4/2021 due to ongoing symptoms that are sharp, substernal, constant, worsened with bending over, intermittently radiating to right neck.  Family history of MIs in the 40s.  Patient does not smoke.  Not a diabetic. New onset of right crampy groin pain and right calf pain.  No history of DVT personally.  Diagnosis in ER: Given the patient&#39;s clinical history, character and duration of symptoms, I am more suspicious for pericarditic equivalent rather than primary ACS. Recommend ibuprofen 400 mg 3 times a day.  X10 days. We will arrange outpatient echocardiogram Once all symptoms are resolved may be in 3 to 4 weeks consider stress testing Will arrange follow-up in the office within a week DC planning from cardiac standpoint.

                                                After 2nd vaccine the next evening had Body aches low grade fever. That was a Sunday I started feeling aches and short of breath from that point on. Mostly when I moved around I couldn?t breathe. Couldn?t walk up stairs without resting on each step. Went to urgent care where oxygen was 80 something percent. Took covid test it came back negative. Lung X-ray looked like I had pneumonia or something . Urgent care told me I had to go to the emergency room. Went to the emergency room and was admitted for two days from June 3 until the fifth. They wanted me to stay an extra day but I had to work so I left. They said it was bacterial pneumonia, but there nobody was for sure. While there I developed blood clotting under my left eye and I started urinating blood as well. I was putOn a lot of antibiotics and steroids while I was there and when I went home.

                                                woke up with fever of 102, and had horrible flu-like aches &amp; chills. Due to being under chemotherapy at the time, was recommended to go to ER because of the fever. There, I was treated with IV fluids.  Labs showed incidental finding of urinary tract infection, so also received IV antibiotics and an NSAID.  Later in day after back home, fever was more mild, around 100. I continued to feel like I had the flu for 2 days total. No energy, very achy, and no appetite.

                                                I just received my first dose of the Pfizer covid19 vaccine yesterday morning. I&#39;m reporting this reaction because what I experienced  is not listed as a common side effect.  Approximately 3-4 hours after receiving my shot at the pharmacy, I started feeling an unusual sense of urgency just before urinating and within less than an hour, it progressed to pain similar to a urinary tract infection that I have had in the past. However, compared to the two UTIs I have experienced in the past, the pain was not felt deep in my urinary tract in my abdomen. Rather, the pain was focused right inside the urethra.  There were two types of situations where I would feel the pain.  The first type of situation was while I was doing nothing in particular and did not feel the need to urinate (sitting, lying down, anything), and the painful sensation would come on as a throbbing pain and then stop.  Then it would start again maybe 5 minutes later.  The second type of situation where I felt the pain was when I sat down on the toilet to urinate, just before the urine passed through the urethra.  I would feel the throbbing pain as I felt the urine get to my urethra and then right when the urine would start coming out, the pain would stop and what I felt instead was the sensation of swollen vulva and urethra but not pain.  In the past, a UTI would take several days to clear up.  I would be in pain urinating for at least the first 3 days.  This time, however, the pain got very intense and frequent lasting into the night, then within 14 hours of the onset of symptoms, it had stopped altogether. I&#39;m certain it was related to the vaccine as it came about within a couple of hours after my shot and went away after 14 hours.   I am not someone who gets UTIs frequently.  I have only had 2 in my lifetime, and the last one was 11 years ago.

Worsening chills until midnight, then complete body ache, muscles, joints, everything, terrible headache.  Was on couch and walked upstairs.  By the time I got there, I was nearly vomiting and on the verge of losing consciousness.  I laid down on the cold tiles and tried to stay conscious. I couldn&#39;t even talk.  Saliva was pouring out of my mouth uncontrollably.  After awhile it let up enough to scoot into the bedroom and climb into bed.  Then an entire night of worsening chills, fever, aches, eye pain, sore throat, pulsating ringing in my ears.  Little if any sleep. I tried to get up and sit in a chair this morning at 3am and within minutes was so nauseated and light headed I had to lay back down flat. Tried to drink some hot tea and Gatorade at 5am.  Thought I heard someone walking around the house and then realized it was heartbeat pounding in my ears.  This morning my feet are super sensitive, I have urinary frequency and urgency, and the pulsatile tinnitus is back.  Later today had episode of sharp chest pains front to back that resolved after about five minutes.  Treatment has been rest today.

A 45-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 04Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history ongoing included sickle cell trait (diagnosed as a child, sickly as a child, found out in 2016. It was reported that patient has the sickle cell that mimics the disease), ongoing high blood pressure, and ongoing genital herpes, and pre-diabetes, all diagnosed prior to vaccination, and &#39;blood pressure&#39;. Concomitant medication included chlorthalidone from 2018 and ongoing for &#39;blood pressure&#39;. It was reported that patient got her first dose of Covid vaccine on 04Jan2021. Patient stated that she has been experiencing some effects, started maybe 2 days after, she began experiencing fatigue (06Jan2021). Patient also stated that she has genital herpes diagnosed before the vaccine, and stated that she usually doesn&#39;t have an outbreak unless there is extreme stress on body. On 08Jan2021, patient clarified she experienced a genital herpes outbreak and thought that it may associated. Patient stated that she treated it with valaciclovir (VALTREX) and some cream and it went away. States that she had another outbreak after, treated it again, and it went away and now she is struggling with another outbreak of genital herpes. Patient also reported that she has on and off headaches (also reported as intermittent headaches) on 04Jan2021, states this could be due to her high/increased blood pressure which she first experienced on 14Jan2021 (as reported). Patient mentioned that her blood pressure has been higher than it ever has been after the vaccine. Patient also stated that she noticed that after the vaccine it was out of control, that she got a blood pressure cuff and it was 149/103, she contacted her nephrologist, stated she is treating it with her usual diuretic and the doctor just prescribed her amlodipine (NORVASC). Patient further stated that she is still struggling to get the diastolic blood pressure in the 90s, stated this is abnormal for her. Also is experiencing severe hip pain bilateral on 08Jan2021 after the vaccine. Patient further reported that she was a little over weight - usually about 150 sometimes 162 around this time she was 162. Patient clarified that her current weight is 159.2 and stated that she was diagnosed with sickle cell trait and stated that she has the kind that mimics the disease and will have a lot of side effects of sickle cell disease. Patient further added that she also has stage 3 kidney failure on 18Jan2021 due to either her high blood pressure or sickle cell trait and is also pre-diabetic. Patient also thought that the outbreak was associated with stress on body. Patient wanted to know if she refuses the second vaccine, if the first vaccine will do anything.

                                                In discussion with Dr., medical director at Detox, she  arrived night of 2/3/21 was quite intoxicated so was not going through any  withdrawal.  She was getting vitals and CIW  checked regularly.  First dose of  chlordiazepoxide 25mg was 2/4 at 1:25pm for CIWA 9.  She had repeat vitals at  5:50pm, CIWA 1, vitals: P 67, 118/79, 94% on RA, T 98.3.  she had complained of  some &#34;pressure in her head&#34; and feeling anxious, but otherwise denied other  complaints.  she was talking with others in the group, then other patients report  she suddenly started having seizure like activity around 6:45pm, med techs came  to help and found her stiff, gurgling.  they tried to get vitals on her, called  911, noticed that at 6:54pm she had lost a pulse and they started CPR.  paramedics arrived at 7:08pm and she was brought to ED.   Pt BIBA in cardiac arrest. Pt was at Detox Center when she  was reported to have seizure-like activity followed by collapse. She  was found to be pulseless and CPR initiated by staff members. EMS  arrived and performed approx 15 min of CPR and gave pt epi x 3 and  bicarb. No shocks administered but they did not report a rhythm.   In the emergency room the patient arrived and was found to be pulseless with PEA arrest, CPR was initiated, patient was intubated. ROSC ultimately achieved, patient remained very acidotic despite ventilator adjustment, head CT revealed cerebral edema. Pt also found to be profoundly anemic with a hemoglobin of 5 and platelets of 37, she was thought to be GI bleeding so medications for this were initiated. Patient then became more hypoxemic with bradycardia, consultation with neurosurgery and critical care medicine at tertiary care center deemed ongoing CPR futile. Patient arrested at 2:30AM on 2/5, pronounced dead at 2:48AM.

                                                acute right flank pain and difficulty breathing a few minutes after vaccine.  Onset was quick and within 5 minutes of initial flank pain, I was unable to take a full breath in.  It felt as if someone was stabbing my right flank - bra level - and taking a breath in was very difficult.  minor relief was experienced when leaning forward and applying tension (I was leaning forward and pressing my arms against the seat of the chair to apply tension to the area.  I was unable to sit straight, stand, walk or move very well without acute stabbing pain in my flank.  I was transported by ambulance to the emergency room where I was told that I has a minor UTI and had &#34;pulled a muscle.&#34;  This &#34;alleged&#34; pulled muscle happen while I was sitting perfectly still in a waiting area on a conference.  As a note, I am not nervous of injections or of the vaccine.  I was feeling great before, during and immediately after the injection until the pain began.   At onset, I felt an intense heat at the injection site that radiated throughout my upper arm around the injection site followed by uncomfortable flank pain and shortness of breath.  Within minutes, the flank pain became acute and it was difficult to catch a full breath without pain - likely due to the acute flank pain.  I was released from the emergency room at approximately 3:00pm with a prescription for antibiotics for the UTI and muscle relaxers..

                                                Initially, I felt fine. Several hours later I began to feel run down, like a cold. I then began to have an ache near my right kidney that I attributed to laying weirdly. However, I also began experiencing a sort of menstrual cramping on my right side as well. This has persisted since Friday night. Today (4/12/21) at about 02:30 pm, I got my period 10 days early! This isn&#39;t normal for me. Right now it is as if I&#39;m spotting (dark discharge to warn that full-on bleeding will happen soon). I don&#39;t usually spot. My period is rather predictable and I have been dutiful in my tracking as my cycle has shortened over the years, going from a 28 day to 25 day cycle. The malaise and aches are consistent with my PMS, but I just wasn&#39;t expecting my period right now. I really don&#39;t understand how this is happening.

                                                15 minutes after the injection I had an intense allergic/anaphylactic reaction.  I was watched and treated on site by EMS for 2 hours with Benadryl, oxygen and rest.  We did not use epi because I was still able to breath (minus some wheezing, coughing, hoarseness and lung irritation).  I felt the reaction hit when I started seeing green spots and my vitals dramatically increased (BP 181/111, HR 142 and weak).  I then experienced the following symptoms: rash/hives on neck and chest, fatigue and weakness, dizzy and lightheaded and needed wheelchair for moving around, chills and shaking, blurry vision, nausea, stomach pain, headache, chest pain and increased urination.  I also had elevated glucose (147).  During those two hours my vitals decreased a little, but the rest of my symptoms persisted.  I was not getting better and my vitals started to increase again at the two hour mark so EMS called an ambulance and transported me to hospital.  I was treated with solumedrol and observed for several hours.  The meds helped enough to send me home.  (I did have to continue taking Benadryl at home that night and the next day because I continued to have an allergic response). I also had severe injection site pain and bruising.

Chest x-ray without abnormalities. EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 108.  No acute ST or T abnormalities.  No ectopy. Renal ultrasound showed a non-obstructing stone in the kidney, but no hydronephrosis. COVID and Respiratory Panel were all negative.  ER COURSE: Patient had already be given IV fluids/Tylenol/morphine prior to my evaluation and was feeling slightly better, but was still having generalized body aches and malaise... Blood cultures were drawn, and IV Rocephin was given.  A second dose of morphine and Benadryl was needed to get the patient somewhat comfortable, but was still having severe body aches and malaise  MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: Initial thought was adverse reaction to COVID vaccine,  but patient also with significant UTI, febrile, and severe body pain requiring multiple doses of IV narcotics for control... Question of adverse reaction to vaccine and or UTI/early pyelonephritis or combination of both...  Hospitalist was consulted to evaluate the patient... Will admit for observation status and continued IV medications. Date of hospitalization = 4/24/2021

A 45-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number EW0150 and expiration date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 05Apr2021 15:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing Hypertension (Patient diagnosed in her late 30&#39;s), ongoing Hypothyroid (Patient diagnosed when she was around 20 years old), ongoing Allergies, ongoing Gastrooesophageal reflux disease (The patient was exposed to a chemical in her 20&#39;s that caused this condition), ongoing Birth control, ongoing Allergic to eggs (States patient has never received the flu vaccine due to her egg allergy), and ongoing Allergic to shellfish. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ongoing levothyroxine at 150 ug, 1x/day for Hypothyroid, ongoing Hydrochlorothiazide at 12.5 mg, 1x/day for hypertension, ongoing omeprazole at 20 mg, 1x/day for gastrooesophageal reflux disease, ongoing losartan at 100 mg, 1x/day for hypertension, ongoing norethisterone (SHAROBEL) for Birth control. On 06Apr2021 13:00, the reporter stated that her daughter fainted at work, lost her urine, and was unconscious and was taken to the Emergency Room. Primary Care Physician told her daughter she should have no problem getting the second vaccine. States that she was not certain if her daughter should get the second shot. It was scheduled for next week. Also, reported that after lunch reporter stated that her daughter fainted in her office at work. She had urinated on herself and was unconscious. Caller was concerned it could have been a seizure. Her daughter was taken to the Emergency Room and they diagnosed her as having a Syncopal Episode. On 06Apr2021, the patient had headaches that continue since these events. The reporter stated that her daughter&#39;s doctor told her daughter that the blood work and electrocardiogram done at the Emergency Room were normal. The Emergency Room and her daughter&#39;s doctor acted like her symptoms were not serious. The reporter looked at the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System website and it said that a syncopal episode is a reportable event. Says that her daughter&#39;s doctors did not report this event. Says doctors need to have training on the importance of reporting events. The reporter called the Food and Drug Administration last week but she hasn&#39;t heard anything from them. States they told her it could take 5-7 business days. Says she called Pfizer today to see if there was any further information or guidance she could get as she is concerned about her daughter. She says her daughter has her own office so she was in there alone when she collapsed. Someone found her on the floor. The reporter was asking for guidance on administration of the second vaccine dose following a syncopal episode after the first. The patient received her first vaccine dose on 05Apr2021 15:00 and she was fine, she had a sore arm, but went to work the next day (06Apr2021) and after lunch she reported feeling light headed and felt her heart beat faster and went to get up and a colleague later found her on the floor and she had wet her pants. They took her to the ER around 1 pm the day after her vaccination and diagnosed her with a syncopal episode stating that they didn&#39;t think it was from the shot. The events syncope, urinary incontinence, seizure, and headache were considered as serious (medically significant) by the reporter. The events syncope, and urinary incontinence caused emergency room visit and physician office visit. The outcome of the events syncope, urinary incontinence was recovered on 06Apr2021.  The outcome of the event Headache was not recovered. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a causal association between the reported events and bnt162b2 cannot be fully excluded.Case will be reassessed when additional information is available.

                                                I was taking medication for hypertension. While it has been slowly getting better over the last year, it was still high enough to take meds, generally around 160/100 without. After the first vaccine it went very low, like 90&#39;s/50&#39;s, very rare for me. After second dose it went up and I took a pill that next day as it was 178/105. That night it went VERY low, and that is the last medication for hypertension I have taken. My BP has remained low, and most all nights it gets to the 90&#39;s/50&#39;s. PCP, Nephrologist, and myself are monitoring.   I also have had issues over last two weeks such as hot flashes/sweats (thought it was due to low BP), and started having blood in my urine last week, with some feeling like it was my period. I haven&#39;t had a period since my transplant 22 years ago, so this is odd and I have a dr appoint scheduled for next week to look into it.

Presented to hospital on 06/08/21 after cardiac arrest, sudden collapse at home, refractory PEA with ongoing CPR &gt;4hrs, cardiogenic shock (EF20%), refractory DIC, MOSF and coma. Uncertain antecedent history, pt had tolerated vaccine well w/o untoward reactions, was possibly &#34;sick&#34; in the 2 days prior to admission 06/08, but limited history available. SARS2 PCR and resp path PCR panels negative, no clear bacterial source of shock/collapse initially identified, thus concern for primary myocarditis resulting in refractory shock (perhaps also with ischemic CVA); Tpn not c/w type I ACS/MI. Workup negative for PE, hemorrhagic stroke, PTX/tamponade, etc. 6hrs after death (in evening 06/08/21) BCx x2 resulted Grp A strep, thus pt may have had TSS at home then collapsed in PEA, however source of TSS is uncertain.  Notably patient usually healthy, active, no medications, favorable lipid panel, no illicits; &#43; EtOH binge-drinking last several months but no cirrhosis/ESLD previously doubt primarily Etoh-related process.  Pt had ongoing PEA arrests with brief ROSC for approx 7 hrs in field -&gt; ED &gt; ICU until death declared.

Around 7pm same day patient began experiencing abnormal vaginal bleeding. The bleeding was about the same amount as the start of a menstrual cycle. Patient has not had a  menstrual period since 2015 due to the  surgical removal of all her reproductive organs including uterus , ovaries , fallopian tubes. Cervix was surgically stitched shut. Patient had to have her reproductive system removed due to a diagnosis of breast cancer back in 2013 to her left breast which required her to undergo chemo and hysterectomy of her breast and reproductive organs. Post vaccination patient abnormally experienced vaginal bleeding that cannot be explained being that she has no reproductive system. The bleeding lasted till next day.

I was seen in the emergency room.  I had a CT scan that showed I passed a stone during my time in the ER. I was treated with pain and anti-nausea medications.   I was in the ER for 4 hours.

                                                Approximately 40 minutes after getting my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed severe abdominal pain and chest tightness. I could not take in a deep breath and became diaphoretic with cold and hot sweats. My ring and pinky finger, both hands, became numb and were tingling with the numbness traveling down to my elbows. I became lethargic and had a feeling of extreme uneasiness followed by a bout of diarrhea.  I then fell asleep for approximately 2 and half hours without moving. When i woke up the numbness was gone but I was still fatigued and had intense abdominal pain and still having the feeling that something wasn&#39;t quite right. I went to the ED the following day for the pain and general feeling of being unwell. At the ED I had high blood pressure, tachycardia, large amounts of blood in my urine and high WBC in addition to the above symptoms. For approximately two weeks after the initial onset of symptoms I still had abdominal pain and distention and  extreme bloating.

Friday, May 28 I went to see Dr.  She ordered bloodwork but I haven&#39;t gotten it back yet.  She put me on Oxybutynin which has been very effective.  It has only been 2 days since I started the medication so I don&#39;t know how long I will need it or if it will be needed longterm.

That Monday the 8th I was still feeling nausea  and feeling hot flashes like I was going to pass out. I ran outside because I didn&#39;t want to pass out in the house alone so I had run outside. I did not know what was going on it was out of nowhere. On Feb the 10th 2021 I went back to work and around 7am I developed a sharp pain on my left side so I went to the ER and they ran tests and said a UTI and possibly a cyst. From 2/10/21 to the rest of the month I was in excruciating pain and had a CAT scan of my abdomen. My DRs sent me to the OBGYN and they said it wasn&#39;t the cyst. My DR said maybe it&#39;s the reason why I was having the GI problems. I got a EG test and a colonoscopy. They said I had organs displaced on the side but that would not cause all these issues. I went to the ER again and they treated me for UTI. Finally I was not satisfied with the results I was getting so I saw DR. I got ultrasound of my Kidney and they still couldn&#39;t see what was wrong. On March 12 2021 around 3AM I woke up in excruciating pain and ambulance came and brought me to the hospital and I went to the ER again and they called the on call OB and they wanted to do surgery and they said I was bleeding internally all this time. My left ovary was bleeding and they had to remove my ovary. I had that left ovary removed on March 12 2021. This has never been an issue before.

My vagina felt itchy and then immediately afterward a very painful and swollen further inside. That was Friday night. for the remainder of the weekend I had terribly painful urination. I called my OB/GYN and scheduled an appointment for January 19. I prescribed Valtrex for possible herpes and Ciprofloxacin for possible bladder infection. The results came back as Oral herpes that were in my vagina.  I would like to add that I did have a strong immune response to the second covid vaccine and had muscle aches, chills and malaise.

After the shot she went and sat in the chairs out front and shortly after someone called out that she needed help nurse ran to her side and she was unresponsive with shallow breathing and sweating and we called 911. As nurse was checking on her nurse 2 grabbed the epipen and administered right away. She came to after the epipen and we were able to talk to her a bit she mentioned that she has fainted a few times. We noticed that she had urinated at some point not sure if it was before or after epipen. The 911 operator suggested that we get her on the floor and have her lay down so we got her on the ground and laid her down as we were doing this she was going in and out of responsiveness. We attempted to take her blood pressure but the machine errored out a couple times. As we were trying to get the blood pressure the ambulance showed up and they took over care. She was transported to Clinic ER. She called later in the afternoon to let us know that she was doing okay and that she appreciated what we had done for her.

                                                Starting 6 days after the vaccination, I began to have itching, burning, discomfort and aching in the muscles of both buttocks symmetrically. It progressed bilaterally down to the soles of both feet over the course of 10 days. I had numbness in a saddle distribution, with multiple patches of cutaneous anesthesia from waist down. I lost feeling in my genitalia. I had urinary frequency, urgency and nocturia. I became constipated with little to no bowel movements for almost 2 weeks. Laxatives did not provide relief. It was very painful to sit at first. 7 days into the progression of symptoms it also hurt to stand. I could not extend my legs at the knee.

I realized I was about to pass out.  I made my last call to my daughter for help.  When she came home I was unresponsive.  She called 911  and started doing what the 911 operator was instructing her to do. I  came to for a few seconds and pasted out again.  I woke up with my sister pounding my chest area.  I passed out again and work to EMTs asking me questions.  I lost my bodily function when I passed out.  On the way to the  ambulance, I began to throw up.  I passed out again and woke up on February 14.  I say up work because I have no recollection of what happened to me after I got in the ambulance.  I was taken to Hospital.  They ran all types of tests.  I know my heart was elevated.    I ended up leaving the hospital on dialysis and a implanted defibrillator.  I have 1342 pages of medical records that I can share.

Headache continued during the day and evening of 2/10/21,   I also did have some transient pins/needles to both hands after dose 1 but thought it was related to sleeping position....then this developed after 2nd dose and I started becoming concerned this was a neurological/nerve related side effect of vaccination.

A 49-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EW0150 and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Apr2021 (at the age of 49 years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization at doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. Medical history included on von willebrand&#39;s disease and sulfa drug allergy. Other medications received by the patient within 2 weeks of vaccination (concomitant medications) was vitamin-D 50,000 IU per week and vitamin-C (ascorbic acid) 1000 IU. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6206 and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 49 years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant at the vaccination time. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Two days after the vaccination (14Apr2021), the patient had severe abdominal pain and could not urinate for 8.5 hours before going to emergency room (ER). The liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 1,599 (units not reported) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 17,655 (units not reported). Six hours later even higher with ALT 4,359 (units not reported) and AST 4,755 (units not reported). Computerized tomography (CT) and all other liver tests and organ tests were completely normal. The patient was hospitalized for these events. The patient was consistent with medication toxicity and was treated for it (only new med the patient took was COVID vaccine - liver enzymes were checked 6 weeks prior at routine appointment and were completely normal) with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) every 4 hours, potassium and fluids. The patient was discharged on 19Apr2021 with a duration of 5 days after supportive care and enzymes consistently going down. The current AST was 34 (units not reported) and ALT was 377(units not reported). These adverse events results in ER visit or urgent care facility. The outcome of these events was recovering at the time of report.

One week after the vaccine I fainted one day during a walk with my husband. I woke up and I had lost control of my bladder but I was unaware of the fact that I was unresponsive. I lost consciousness for 2-3 minutes. I had Gastrointestinal problems for one month after the second dose of the vaccine. My stomach was upset and I had Diarrhea as well as a raw feeling in my stomach. I have never had those problems before.  I recovered after one month approximately .

                                                Within a few minutes of getting the vaccine her head started pounding and her eyes felt like they were going to pop out of her head. Paramedics came to her aide. Her blood pressure  was ski high (170/100). Paramedic told her to sit there and drink water. Went home and laid down until evening. Then when she went to the bathroom she had a lot of  bubbles in the toilet. She had not had that since her kidneys failed. That continued through the weekend. She called the doctor Monday morning and he told her to get lab work done on Tuesday morning because she had already taken her morning meds. Wednesday morning the lab called her to tell her to go straight to the emergency room because her kidneys were failing again. They were trying to save the kidney. They said there was a lot of fluid, so they rushed her to surgery to put in a drainage bag. She was admitted for a week. They determined after a few days that the drainage bag was not working and took it out. Then they out in a stint.  She kept the stint in for a month. But while she was in the hospital they performed a kidney biopsy to see if the kidney was still working. They determined it was not working. She has a family member now that is getting tested to see if she can donate a kidney. She is now in dialysis 3 days a week, 3.5 hours each time. Has been in and out of the hospital since for multiple reasons. Has had to have catheters replaced and placed on multiple medications.

                                                Got booster shot on Wednesday the 20th, came home and was fatigued. Thursday had horrible headache that would not be relieved with tylenol. I took a plane and arrived at 1130 pm. I went to bed shortly after arriving at my daughters house. Friday morning, I was unable to be woken up and my daughter called 911. I was in a coma. I suffered cardiac arrest during a CT to check for clots. I was resuscitated and put on life support. CT scan for clots, strokes, heart attacks were all clear. I was admitted to the C-ICU and on life support, on the ventilator, and was on 3 different medications at max dosage to keep my blood pressure barely surviving. The doctors told my daughter not to expect me to survive because they had no idea why I was suddenly so ill.  A doctor then told my daughter that my kidneys were failing, and my liver was damaged.  I also developed a high fever and had a high white blood cell count. They gave me Vancomycin and another antibiotic, and then the next the day a kidney doctor gave me lasix to flush out all of the excess fluid. I woke up on Saturday not knowing what had happened and was completely terrified and confused. My daughter was allowed into the ICU to see me and keep me calm, thankfully. She explained to me what happened. I am still in the hospital, as they are keeping me for observation and trying to determine if my kidneys will start working properly again.  Prior to this, I have only ever had a kidney infection, and I thought before I might have had the start of a UTI.  I do have chronic high blood pressure as well, a long term side effect from open heart surgery 10 years prior for an aneurysm, but aside from that I am relatively healthy 50 year old.

                                                I had my first dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on 12/23/20.  I was exposed to COVID-19 on 12/28 and positive on 1/3/21.  I had a mild infection, but my chronic constipation was resolved and had easy stooling that week.  On 1/7/21 I was having right upper quadrant abdominal pain, radiating to bilateral kidney pain and it resolved by the 8th or 9th.  I asked for a health care visit because the discomfort was strong.   I received the second dose of the COVID Pfizer vaccine on 1/13/21.  No immediate problems but intermittent pain in upper right abdomen into my kidneys.   By 1/25/21 I had constant pain in my kidneys and in general my abdomen was bloated and tender.  I thought I had a kidney infection and was prescribed abx.  By the next day the pain was becoming more severe and I went to the ER the night of 1/26.  CT showed a mass in the live and extensive stool throughout the bowel - even though I had been eating and stooling normal for me with hx of chronic constipation.  I had to stop eating and completing clean out my colon.  The swelling in the my abdomen took about 2 weeks to subside and I was unable to eat for several days.  I was diagnosed with mild diffuse fatty liver disease, which had not been previous an issue.  MRI determined I have a cyst on my ovary also.

                                                On 4/5/21, two days after my second injection, I was sitting at my desk working (at home) when I noticed my vision wasn&#39;t clear even with my glasses on. I had been feeling nauseous for a few hours and then my eyes started bouncing back and forth uncontrollably. I was unable to see correctly or move from my chair. Once my eyes stopped moving my vision became tunnel vision and everything around it became foggy. I felt weak and dizzy. I started getting a headache. I didn&#39;t think I could even call out for help as I was unsure my voice would work. Once it all calmed down I figured it must be part of a migraine, even though nothing this extreme had ever happened before. I moved to my bed as I was suddenly completely exhausted, and immediately fell asleep for almost 3 hours. Once I got up I was still very groggy and had to force myself my. I stayed up for about 3 hours and went back to bed for the night. The next morning I woke and was feeling better so I figured it must have been a migraine. However a few hours later the same problems started back up again. I was having a hard time seeing my computer screen, I had a foggy head and was finding it hard to concentrate and do work. My headache started again and my vision started as foggy and became tunnel vision again. This time my eyes did not bounce, but my lips started tingling. This lasted for about 1 minute. This time with everything I was making sure to take a mental note of everything going on because I was scared I was going to have to call 911. Because I was home alone I opened my phone to dial if it got any worse. The event backed off enough that I took myself to the ER. By the time I was in the waiting room my head felt like a balloon and my whole body just felt &#34;off.&#34; I can&#39;t explain how it felt, it just didn&#39;t feel normal. My headache never got overly severe like it does with a migraine, but I was worried about a stroke. The ER did a CT scan and did rule out a stroke, but was unsure of what it exactly what it was, but guessed it was an abnormal migraine attack and told me to follow up with my PCM in a couple of days and to keep my appointment with my neurologist on April 15th. The symptoms lasted a full week off and on every day, with a tampering down of severity of symptoms.

                                                Patient was treated on 3/10/21 w/ 3 days of Bactrim for UTI. First COVID vaccine 3/18/21, that day developed redness and swelling of face, low back, chest, feet. Rash is persistent to this date with no imprvovement. She had bloodwork to rule out, RA, Lyme, thyroid disease all within normal limits. Skin biopsy was done 4/1/21 which showed likely hypersensitivity reaction to drug or ssytemic allergic versus a connective tissue disease.  Stains that were done argue against Lupus.

                                                I received the first Covid vaccine on 2/25/21. I had bloodwork drawn related to my yearly physical on 3/11/21. They ran a CBC and basic metabolic panel. My CBC was normal and my levels specifically my Creatinine was completely normal. I received the second vaccine on 3/18/21. On 3/20/21 I started feeling a lot of pain in my abdomen area and was feeling really bloated. I was having a little difficulty breathing. I went to my PCP on Monday 3/22/21. They ran a CBC and a basic metabolic panel again. That afternoon, my PCP sent me for a CT scan of my abdominal and pelvic area. On the morning of 3/23/21, my PCP called me my Creatinine level ran the day before was at 5. Also my CT scan had come back.  I also had moderate ascites (fluid in my abdomen).  I also had a large right pleural effusion.  On 3/23/21, my PCP sent me to the ER for hospital admission.  I was in the hospital for 12 days.  I was in acute kidney failure.  They drained the fluid from my abdomen.  They inserted a temporary port and I had 4 rounds of dialysis.  On my 9th day in the hospital, the kidney doctor started me on 80 mg of Lasix per day.  My urine output increased dramatically and my creatinine levels began to drop. I had not had any issues prior to the kidney failure that would typically cause it to happen.  The only new medicine or change had been the Covid vaccine administration.  The kidney doctor and the hospitalist dismissed this idea.  I am reporting it because it was the only thing new and my levels had been normal less than 2 weeks before.

Medical history was none.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At first, she thought she was having a reaction, but then she started feeling sick so she got tested. She was positive so she wasn&#39;t having a reaction. She was scared from the pain of COVID. She experienced sickness. Her stomach was still weirded out. She did experience arm pain from the vaccine. Her doctor told her it was fine that it needed to air out. She left the bandage on too long.  She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She received the vaccine on the 29Dec2020. She tested positive 02Jan2020. The arm wasn&#39;t swollen it was just burning. She was sick to her stomach when she got the stomach. The sick to the stomach lasted maybe two days, but then she got COVID. The burning was around the arm. It wasn&#39;t that bad. It lasted for a day. It started the day she got the shot (on the 29Dec2020). On 07Jan2021, she went to the hospital because her kidneys were hurting. The doctor said her kidneys were good. They did labs which were good. She was still going through body aches. She was told she was currently in the worst part of the virus. She still had a sour stomach going on from the virus as well. The outcome of the body aches and sour stomach was not recovered, for other events was unknown.

I went to see the doctor on 7/1/2021 because I developed a urinary infection and pneumonia. I had shortness of breath, fatigued, low grade fever, urinary pressure and frequency and urgency. They did blood work, urine culture and CT scan which confirmed pneumonia and UTI. I was prescribed Levaquin which has resolved both my UTI and pneumonia. I am still suffering from symptoms and side effects from the vaccine. I have daily full body pains and aches, headaches, fatigue, chills, loss of appetite and unable to work or do normal daily activities.

Back pain (kidney area) beginning few days after injection, lasting several days.  Non-muscular pain, more internal such as kidney pain. Worst symptoms:  Itching, redness, swelling,  inflammation below the injection site, approx 3&#34;Hx7&#34;W band across my left arm,beginning about 2&#34; below the point of injection. Today is day 12 and I&#39;m still experiencing this. Moderate itching 24 hrs, mild swelling, red, hot, inflamed. Symptoms are less severe at this point.

A 52-year-old female received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 at 10:30 AM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. The patient ha d no allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination, and was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and also did not receive any other medication within two weeks of vaccination. The patient had a headache on 22Jan2021 for 5 days. She also had stomach bloating and pressure and discomfort on 22Jan2021. It was reported that when she saw blood in her urine, she went to a walk-in and was diagnosed with a UTI on 22Jan2021. She did 7 days of an antibiotic. Then on 30Jan2021, she had an abscess tooth that became infected. It was reported that the patient received antibiotics for both infections. It was reported that the events result in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and an Emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was recovering. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).

                                                Injection was at 12 PM. At 12:15 PM I started to feel a furry throat like I had a hairball in my throat and a tickle. Within a minute or so I got a cough, a dry cough with a high pitch. I could not stop coughing.  My face felt hot and was flushed, my lips tingly, and I started to sweat a lot. I was short of breath when I tried to talk. The staff on site put an oximeter on and my oxygen was fine but my pulse rate was around 130. My nose was dripping snot and my eyes were running.  We walked over to ER which was just around the corner, And sat in the waiting room for about 10 minutes wondering if the cough and symptoms would update.  I  Peed my pants a little bit.  I started to feel very nauseous and little bit scared, even though this has happened to me before.  I was brought to a room and soon given a dose of Epi as well as Pepcid (about 1pm)  soon after some Zofran. The epi took care of my symptoms within about five minutes.  About 90 mins later symptoms came back full on and I was given another dose of Epi at almost 3pm.  And agin at 630pm.

                                                Presented to ED with significant exacerbation of fibromyalgia symptoms severe GI discomfort (3 days after Covid vaccine). She states that her pain feels similar to when she was admitted in December 2020 for diverticulitis. She denies urinary symptoms and hematochezia. She has been taking generic Bentyl with minimal relief to her symptoms. She took an Oxycodone this morning with moderate relief to her symptoms. Patient admitted. Urinalysis shows obvious infection.  There is some squamous cell contamination. Bicarbonate was 15. Pregnancy test was positive and her quantitative hCG is 16 which is negative.  CBC did not have leukocytosis or thrombocytopenia.  She has baseline, chronic anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.9.  CT imaging of the abdomen pelvis was performed without contrast secondary to renal dysfunction.  She does have what appears to be early diverticulitis. Patient started on Invanz which will be continued. Gentle fluid, diet as tolerated, as needed antiemetic, as needed analgesic and antipyretic. Added Xifaxan 550 mg BID x 3 weeks to discharge regimen. General surgery was consulted given this is pt&#39;s 3rd bout of diverticulitis in less than a year.  At this time, they recommended ABX mgt and referral to AMC with a GI surgeon given her complex status with the kidney transplant and CKD.  GI was also consulted at pt&#39;s request.  Rec 3 weeks of rifaxamin in addition to whatever standard diverticulitis treatment.  Pharmacy reviewed pt&#39;s allergy list and thought moxifloxacin 400 mg daily would be sufficient (it also has anaerobic coverage).

I am VERY fit, do high intensity workout, hike tall mtns 15-20 mi day hikes and never get sick.  Had these cycling symptoms the DAY I got the second vax after just minimal arm ache with the first vax.  I had newer job as mortgage lender - working 45-50 hrs on phone 9-10 hrs a day selling loans company wanted at least 150 calls a day - high stress and pressure.  Have been on medical leave since this started as no way can work; get awful cough fits if even talk for a few mins and memory gets like a sieve and I have gotten disoriented in my own home.  It is very disabling and I was FINE before and am VERY durable.

                                                05/18/2021 around 2AM I woke up in the middle of the night with severe chills and I took my temperature and it was 100.8 degrees. For me, I&#39;m usually at 97.2 degrees. Everything in my body hurt. I stayed home from work the next day and the fever didn&#39;t break. I never got sweaty but it just didn&#39;t break. I treated it with either ibuprofen or Tylenol. It eventually went away and I was fine. A week later on 05/25/2021 the same thing happened where I woke up in middle of night shaking and a fever of 101.3 degrees. Every part of my body hurt, behind my eyeballs hurt. I called my doctor and because I had a fever and she said I couldn&#39;t come into the office. My heart was fluttering as well and she said just go to the ER and get checked out and have them do a COVID test even though I&#39;m fully vaccinated. I went to hospital and they did a rapid PCR COVID test which came back negative but my blood work, liver was off, proteins were off. The doctor did not come anywhere near me and told me I had UTI, gave me antibiotic, and sent me home. I&#39;ve had UTI&#39;s before and I know what they feel like and this didn&#39;t feel like that. The next day 05/26/2021 I did a video visit with my doctor and I still didn&#39;t feel right. The fever part of it broke but she said that since I was still having the weird heart thing just go straight to ER so I said ok. The next morning my heart was fluttering so I went to the ER again but I went to a different hospital ER. They did blood work, EKG, Epstein-Barr, but no COVID test this time. My doctor had said to me that I really sound like I had COVID regardless of negative test. Again, the liver function was high, they did hepatitis ABC that all came back negative. Epstein-Barr came back high but not hugely high. They just said they didn&#39;t know what was wrong with me. They said it might be hepatitis or Epstein-Barr but I didn&#39;t have symptoms of mono. I did have tiny cough sometimes. They did a chest x-ray on me and didn&#39;t find anything mysterious. Over next few days they kept re-running blood and liver function test and it was still off for another 2 weeks. They sent me to cardiology because of shortness of breath and chest pain along with palpitations. He ordered more blood work and a stress echo. This past Tuesday 07/06/2021 he did angiogram thinking he would find blockages but he found nothing. He said my heart looked good but no explanation. I have never had heart palpitations before in my life. By 06/24/2021 my liver enzymes were back to normal but they&#39;re still not sure what is going on with my heart but from what he told me I don&#39;t have any blockages and my heart looks fine. My next appointment with cardiology is on 07/22 or 07/23. I was also having some vaginal bleeding and I was at the time 7 months into menopause. I went to Gynecology and they found polyps and I am going into have procedure to have polyps removed.

Then, for the next 3 weeks,  I got chest pain ( I can feel my heart tight even when I sat, walking made heart more pain  for  a week.  The 2nd week  only had heart pain when walking,  the 3rd week had heart pain if running), also  severe headaches.  I  wanted to call my doctor,  but  close to  July 4th week,  so I didn&#39;t call.  Also I don&#39;t know if doctor can do anything to make it better.

                                                I decided to sit for 30 mins after the 2nd vaccine. At about 15 minutes after the vaccine, I was lightheaded, and my heart started to beat bad. I also had extreme chest pain. They took my vitals and I started to sweat profusely. Based on my vitals and my symptoms they thought I was having a heart attack. They took me over to the ER, and I started to experience kidney pain. The pain from that was so bad I thought I was going to vomit. They took me back into one of the rooms and they started all the test to see if I was having a heart attack. I started to have trouble breathing. My pulse was okay. All the tests came back inconclusive. My EKG came back abnormal. They discharged me to go home. I went back to the ER less than a week later because I was experiencing COVID like symptoms. I was tachycardic and had hard time breathing. I had swelling in my arm where the injection was given. I was unable to dress like normal and I could not even walk my dog without being out of breath. I went to the Urgent Care and they diagnosed me with a Pleurisies&#39; and System Inflammatory. They prescribed me a steroid and I was told to take it for 10 days. They also gave me an inhaler as well. They did not do anything. I went back to the doctor after the steroid, and I was still having difficulty breathing. I had joint pain, headaches, I was still unable to take a deep breath. I was sitting at my kitchen table and passed out. I woke up on the floor. I drove myself to the ER and they were going to admit me, and they treated me for a migraine. They decided to a migraine cocktail. I had extreme pain in my lower legs. They were afraid of me having a DVT. They did an ultrasound and did not find a DVT. They decided to send me home. Between the last visit to now I have had between 5-7 more visits to the ER and urgent care due to not being able to breath and the joint pain. I have Dilated Aortic Root Valve and I am also Tachycardic neither of which I had before. Now I am better, but I do at times have difficulty breathing.

A 53-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8732), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 07Apr2021 10:30, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no known allergies and was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6207) received at age 53 years, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 16Mar2021 11:00, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. On 08Apr2021 at 03:30, the patient woke up trembling uncontrollable and was freezing. She had a terrible headache. At about 04:30, the patient got out of bed to get some Advil and go to the bathroom. She almost got to the bathroom but was unable to hold her urine and had sudden diarrhea as soon as she sat down. She then became extremely weak and passed out. She was sweating profusely and had a temp of 101. She took Tylenol and Advil and her temp broke an hour or two later. She then had a headache and was lethargic all day on 08Apr2021. On 09Apr2021, the patient felt much better but reported she was still weak, she also had a rash covering most of her torso. Treatment for the events trembling uncontrollable, freezing, terrible headache and temp of 101 included Tylenol and Advil. No treatment was taken for the remaining events. The outcome of extremely weak was not recovered; and the outcome of the remaining events was recovering.

Also, she has leg pain; it started in her upper left leg on the 7th, deep in a vain, almost like a nerve pain, but last night it was in her right leg; it comes in waves. The pain is in the top inside part of her legs. It&#39;s either a nerve thing or a blood vessels thing. When she was experiencing the frequent urination, she started wondering if the vaccine was all leaving her body, so now she doesn&#39;t know if she has the protection from the vaccine. Is there a way to check that? She has Interstitial Cystitis anyway, and there are a lot of things that can flare it up, but this just lasted longer. States that it lasted about 3 hours, and now she is back to her normal. While it was occurring, it was excessive, she went to the bathroom about 8-10 times an hour and her pee was clear. States she was trying to drink more water to make sure she didn&#39;t get dehydrated, but as soon as she drank, she would have to go again.  She stated the intermittent headache and slight nausea, she expected to have after the vaccine. The cramping from her cycle is easing up, but the flow was really heavy earlier today, but in the last hour is has slowed a bit.  On the night of 08Jun2021, her gums were really bleeding when she was brushing her teeth, and last night they were bleeding, but this morning there was no bleeding at all, so hopefully it&#39;s stopped but she won&#39;t really know until she brushes her teeth tonight. The events did not result in Emergency Room or Physician Office visit.  No relevant tests performed.  The outcome of event pain in leg, gums have been bleeding was resolving. The outcome of other events was resolved. The patient was due to get her 2nd dose on 10Jun2021, but she was nervous to get it.  She has auto-immune concerns; she has a positive ANA. Her doctor told her that she definitely needs to get the vaccine.  She had her second dose scheduled on 18Jun2021.    Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested

                                                Went to bed with racing heart and chills on the 23rd of March.  Felt weak on the 24th and couldn&#39;t go to work.  On the 27th, took my Lyme antibiotic, Tinidazole.  Felt weak on the 28th.  Better on the 29th and took second antibiotic - Azithromycin - in the AM.  Early that evening, began feeling burning skin, pins &amp; needles in arms and upper body, severe chills with no fever, frequent urination and bowel movements, chest wall pain and high anxiety.  Tried to go to bed, was unable to sleep because chills lasted throughout the night.  Went to hospital at 7AM on the 30th.  Was released same day.  They didn&#39;t prescribe anything.  Spent the next two weeks on bed rest due to severe weakness and fatigue.  Went back to work on Tuesday, 4/13/21, for four days.  On Saturday and Sunday was bedridden again.  Went into work on 4/19/21 and was sent home due to racing heart and weakness.  On Saturday, 4/24/21, went back into hospital with racing heart, chills, weakness, nausea, chest wall pain, high anxiety.  Release same day.    Didn&#39;t go to work from 4/26-4/30.  Took leave of absence from work (I am an elementary school teacher) from May 3-June 23, 2021.

By 6 pm I started feeling aches, especially my joints and muscles. Was at a laundrymat and pulling clothes out of dryer -felt impossible to hold them up...burning and aching in shoulders and neck. Feel waves of fatigue.  Left, went home...felt hot and clammy.  Took temp- it was 101.7. Took tylenol, gabapentin, and went to sleep in recliner. Woke up at 11 pm, severe muscle weakness...so much that by the time I got out of the recliner...and on my feet...I already began to urinate on myself. It was like I could not control my body...I had very little ability to get up and out of recliner...everything was so HEAVY....my arms and legs were &#34;weighted&#34;. After using restroom...it took 15 min just to change out of soiled clothing and clean up...and re-dress.  I laid down in the bed, but was very uncomfortable...so went back to recliner. Was physically unable to get the lid off the tylenol after trying very hard....I fell back to sleep.   At 3:15 am I woke up needing to pee, and once recliner was at normal seated position...I struggled to use my arms to lift myself up...my right arm, where I got vaccine hurt badly...it felt like PAIN...like beyond sore. I pitched to floor cuz legs wouldn&#39;t hold me.  My fever was 103.7... J feel hard-pressed to finish cuz I got a warning im about to time out. Guess I hope someone contacts me. I hav

My speech was a bit slurred at first, I got out of bed, felt nauseous, and my ears were ringing very loudly.  I sat up for a while, then went back to bed.  I didn&#39;t connect it to the vaccine, but wondered about the connection.  Then I heard it happened to someone else, so I thought I should report it.  I did not seek medical care.

I ran downstairs and outside to get air and the earth felt like it was spinning under me and everything was moving. I felt nauseous and confused and had racing thoughts. I fell back and hit my head and got up and tried to come inside and ended up falling again and urinating while on the floor. I believe I lost consciousness.  I couldn?t stand and vomited several times in the ER.

A 54-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 07Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included history of three spinal surgeries (takes no pain meds, she is not on pain meds, she has never been on or kept taking them); and has &#34;neuropathy and nerve related issues&#34; that were not this bad since ten years ago in 2011, clarified that what she has is not actually neuropathy, something with the peripheral nerve, she says she doesn&#39;t remember actual verbiage), since ten years ago in 2011, and the only difference was this vaccination, it was not this bad until this vaccination. She doesn&#39;t react well to pharmaceuticals anyway (unspecified). Her medications are that she takes the minimum amount of medications, very minimal (unspecified). There were no concomitant medications. There was no other products. Also, she has not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. For past drug, she didn&#39;t take anything other than 5mg of zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) to sleep at night because of her spine. Patient previously also took pregabalin (LYRICA) and was off it, was also on gabapentin or neurontin (patient did not have those medications to provide NDC/LOT/EXP for either of them because she took them back to the pharmacy or turned them in to the police station because she doesn&#39;t keep medications in her house if she isn&#39;t taking them, and she couldn&#39;t take that medication). Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 on 14Jan2021 (at the age of 54-year-old; Lot Number: EN5318) in Arm Right for covid-19 immunization, and for her first dose the only thing was a sore arm, it was very sore, and she only experienced a slight bit of fatigue after her first dose. She received both doses of vaccine. Her first dose was LOT: EN5318 and was given 14Jan2021, and her second dose was LOT: EN6204 given 07Mar2021. The patient was reporting for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, for she was having a horrible reaction to it &#34;45 days&#34; (as reported) after taking 2nd dose, and had been in the ER, and her temperature still hasn&#39;t gone back down to her normal, her oral temp is still raised and her rectal is raised even more. She was not feeling well, she felt very bad, she would never get a vaccine again, that is how bad it was. Since &#34;45 days&#34; later she was still having significant pain and trouble flexing her right hand open and closed. For events treatment, she took over the counter Tylenol for fever and pain, strength unknown. Patient said she had not had this kind of disabling symptoms or anything before this vaccination. She had a slight fever almost the whole &#34;45 days&#34;. On 08Mar2021, her oral temp was over 98 degrees Fahrenheit when her norm temp being 97.2 or 97.3degrees Fahrenheit. Her rectal temp stayed at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The next day, actually on the 09Mar2021 (which was two days after her second dose), she had the slight fever, fatigue, and extreme pain through her right side. She said her right side means her shoulders, neck, torso, arm, and entire leg. She also had shortness of breath, and severe nerve pain. She called her primary care provider who said to wait 5 days to be seen. On day 5, or actually the whole five days (reported as in Mar2021), she was in bed and didn&#39;t leave her apartment because she was in bed and she was vomiting. On day 2 or within 6 hours of vaccination, she had a feeling of urination, like she had to urinate when she didn&#39;t, that feeling of urination was equivalent of having contrast dye (NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown) put in her IV which makes her feel like she is peeing her pants but she did not, and that feeling has not gone away. On day 5 (11Mar2021), she was dizzy and fell. In Mar2021, she was disorientated and vomiting, she couldn&#39;t eat anything other than soup. On day two (Mar2021) she had some kind of eye pain that is still there &#34;45 days later&#34;, it feels like pins and needles. Her skin was burning and painful to the touch, she couldn&#39;t keep an IV in her when she was in the ER. She was not admitted to the hospital. She was having headaches, and joint and muscle pain. She had nausea and vomiting at different times. She continued to have shortness of breath. She had a horrible lack of appetite. She had sores in her mouth and nose. She had anal hemorrhoid sores. Last night (05Apr2021 )she had a headache that was severe like someone put a knife behind her right eye, and when she got up (06Apr2021) her eye felt heavy and her eye was drooping. She also had difficulty speaking, with her words. She says she had passed out, and had been dropping things, she had broken glass. She has been to a neurologist and a gastroenterologist. She clarified that all of these events were after her second dose, for her first dose the only thing was a sore arm, it was very sore, and she only experienced a slight bit of fatigue after her first dose. None of her doctors know what to do, her gastro doctor was giving her an anti inflammatory suppository and was going to do some tests. She had blood done from neurologist and at the ER and no one knows what to do, they keep referring her to other doctors. She wished someone could explain to her, but no one know and they said it was uncharted territory, they didn&#39;t know what to do. She is now back on Lyrica which she was off of but the ER prescribed her 300mg three times a day. She wanted to know what the hell is going on with this vaccine, and that she doesn&#39;t think having these side effects &#34;45 days&#34; out is normal. She wanted to be transferred to speak with someone about what to do because her doctor&#39;s don&#39;t know anything. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 54-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration administered in the right arm on 25Mar2021 11:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history reported as follows: The patient has had trouble with her bladder since 2008 when she had a bladder sling put in. The patient stated that the company knew there were problems with the bladder slings, and they were still allowing the bladder slings to be put inside of people. There were times when the patient could not urinate and the bladder sling had to be cut and finally taken out of her. The doctor couldn&#39;t remove all the bladder sling because some of the bladder sling grew inside of her body. She had to wear a urinary catheter for months strapped to her leg. She had a back surgery and a doctor messed her up on the left side. Her doctor does manipulations on her back and helps her with her pain. Additionally, she had a bladder infection in Oct2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient received her first dose on 25Mar2021. The patient stated that she had a doctor&#39;s appointment for her back (medical history). The night before the appointment she was fine, but on the next day (08Apr2021) it was horrible. While she was there in the appointment, she had a urine test and her doctor found blood in her urine on 08Apr2021. She felt like she had to urinate but only a few drops of urine would come out on 08Apr2021. Her doctor told her that the last time she had a bladder infection was in Oct2020 (medical history). Since she might have a bladder or kidney infection on 08Apr2021, she was prescribed Macrobid 100mg take one every 12 hours for 7 days. She&#39;s scheduled to receive her second Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow, 15Apr2021. She wanted to know if the antibiotic will cause any problems with getting the second Covid-19 vaccine. The adverse events required a visit to the physician&#39;s office. The outcome of the adverse events was unknown.

Second dose given 04/23/21 and by 04/28/2021 I started bleeding again And by the second day I was soaking through pads and huge clots were coming out. This has never happened to me before.  After 7 days of bleeding heavily I woke up on May 5th at 4:00 a.m. with intense abdominal cramping The only way I can describe was labor. I felt back labor, pelvic pressure, frequent urination and intense pain. I reached out to my gynecologist And he immediately told me to remove my estrogen patch and later that morning he started me on progesterone treatment for 10 days to stop the bleeding. After 7 hours of pain on May 5th, I went to the emergency department and an ultrasound revealed a blood clot. From ultrasound results &#34;there is a complex area in the area of the cervix measuring 5.7 x 3.6 x 2.6 cm.&#34;   After several hours I was released from the emergency room taking toradol for pain. That evening I passed a huge blood clot!  I&#39;m very grateful it was where it was and I could expel it.  But there&#39;s no doubt the second vaccine caused this issue that has never happened to me before. I still get my periods though irregular and very light. So this event was highly unusual and very painful

She eventually died from septic shock.

                                                Five hours after receiving the vaccine I developed a headache, nausea, I started to stutter and I couldn&#39;t think clearly. That evening I had really strange dreams. I could hear my husband talking on the phone out in the living room. I was dreaming, but I knew that I was awake. I just couldn&#39;t wake myself up. I had those dreams for 2-3 nights. I was screaming in my sleep. I was conscious about what was going on, but my body was in REM cycle, and I couldn&#39;t wake up. Around 03/15, I started vomiting, had chills, diarrhea and developed fevers. I couldn&#39;t stop vomiting and my doctor thought that I may have had COVID. I went into the ER on 03/15. I was put into an isolated room because they thought I had COVID. I received a couple COVID tests completed and the PCR came back negative. At this point, they thought I may have a secondary infection coming on. I was told I had a UTI, but then they thought it might have been a kidney stone that was stuck. They performed a CT scan and I had 7 kidney stones that were there. I was told that maybe my body was trying to pass a stone when I received the vaccine. The doctor gave me oxycodone, Zofran and I had 3 bags of IV&#39;s (one with antibiotics in it.) After I went home they changed my antibiotics to a much stronger one, Ciproslaxon, for 14 days. I recently had laser surgery and lithotripsy surgery to remove the kidney stones. They noticed that there were more kidney stones on the other side. I have to have a second surgery to remove them. I have to have a third surgery  because they found a gall bladder stone. I have also noticed that I have been having problems with congestion. I have never had any allergies with pollen or having to take allergy medication. I am having difficulty swallowing and I am coughing more. I&#39;ve noticed that my memory is foggy also.

Caller states she had an appointment to get first shot, but they spelled her name wrong, and the # had to do a VIP thing. Before she went to get the shot she was trying to ask the medical doctor from the # some questions because she had concerns, but before she could tell them any part of her history, the doctor just said to go ahead and give her the shot. States the reason she got the number for Pfizer was from when, on 15Apr, she went to #, to begin with, and they tested her for covid, and gave her instructions, she was off of work. Caller clarifies she never got a phone call, when agent asks for test results of the test. Caller confirms this test was done before her shot. Event details: Caller states she got first shot and a couple days later, it was the normal flu-like body aches; she was told to got to store and get stuff for allergies, and for the flu, but she already had Tylenol and Benadryl for allergies. Caller clarifies she was told this by the #; they gave the shot, had them sit down and wait 15-20 minutes, then let them go, and told them what to do. Caller states these symptoms only lasted a couple of days. States that she doesn&#39;t remember if she actually took the Tylenol or Benadryl as treatment for the flulike body aches.

States she had to go back to medical facility because she was having reactions, she was in the emergency room for weakness, and other things, and had to be checked for blood clots, so she had to go back. She was there on 13May, 14May, they did a venous doppler on everything because she was having all kinds of pain in legs. Then on 15May, she had to go back to be checked for something, right after she got out of emergency room, and after she had the test, she was medically  to get the second shot, and after she got the second shot, it&#39;s been downhill from there. Caller states she was admitted into # Hospital, and was in and out of the hospital. States she coded, they had to do CPR on her, and this has affected all of her nerves. Caller states they gave both shots in her left arm and it has set off everything and all the nerve damage. Caller states this is scaring her because she is the only family member who has had the Pfizer shot. Everybody else is out of the state and had the Johnson and Johnson, or all the other vaccines, and she&#39;s the only one who&#39;s had this shot, and the one who has had the most damage. Call handler made multiple attempts to clarify information provided and get further details, but asks to move on because all the questions are setting her off. Caller states maybe she should have had the case worker call. Caller clarifies, she did not have arthritis prior to this. Caller states 31May2021, she was rushed to Place because she couldn&#39;t get up off the floor, they weren&#39;t sure what was going on with her, her bladder, so they put her on prednisone for a week. Caller did not finish statement regarding her bladder. Caller states all hospitals she has been in have been #, with exception of one in #. Caller provides #, when agent asks for spelling or clarification. Caller states she can&#39;t hold the phone very long, and she can&#39;t sit up for very long either. States she has a hard time pronouncing the letters, when agent asks her to spell the hospital name. Caller states the problem is agent is on a headset and her phone is set up for handicap for an ear that can&#39;t hear properly, so she states the agent being on a headset is why agent can&#39;t hear her. Caller states she has hearing loss and can&#39;t hear the consonants. Caller states she is due to take medicine and can&#39;t take it while on the phone. Caller asks if there a fax number to fax the rest of this to. Caller states all of the hospitals, #, are all under #, it&#39;s a whole medical group with all different hospitals in different towns. Caller states prior to emergency room visit, she was in # Hospital because she couldn&#39;t walk, was having trouble walking.

Caller adds she has not had a paycheck since 09Apr or tenth, states landlord hasn&#39;t thrown her out but she&#39;s close to being evicted because she hasn&#39;t worked, it&#39;s been determined the side effects have caused more damage. Caller states 15Apr2021 she got Pfizer&#39;s phone number when she was tested for covid. Caller states that&#39;s when they did the test but she never heard anything back regarding the results of the test. She quarantined at a hotel, and had to be away from work. Caller states it&#39;s been # Hospital where it started. Caller states maybe agent needs to call back and finish report because she has all of hospital papers dissected with dates. Caller states she was given a huge packet on 15Apr, when she was tested for covid. at medical facility which is the only local medical facility, and she went there on 15Apr because her boyfriend&#39;s sons&#39; girlfriend tested positive and he&#39;s in #, and they gave her a note for her work with instructions. Caller clarifies they gave her a huge packet so that&#39;s where she got all the paperwork in Apr before she got the shot. Caller states after the first shot she had 48 hours of hot flashes, the chills, typical flu-like symptoms; only lasted 48 hours, and then from the twenty third she&#39;s had different symptoms, and has been in an out of hospitals, trying to figure out what was going on with her. States she was healthy and working until 07Apr, 08Apr, or 09Apr, is the last time she worked. Then she quarantined from 13Apr until 27Apr, and then they had to get vaccinated, so she registered, and when she went there, they spelled her name wrong with a # instead of #, she she started asking questions trying to give medical history before the shot. She had not given any of her history and doctor said to just give it. They gave the shot in her left arm and from then on the damage hit and it has been one thing after another. Caller states she previously had a test done in 2017, electrical shock from toes to head, and acupuncture same day, and only thing showed up was carpal tunnel in right and left hand. She was being treated with 1000 mg Tylenol, and she was fine working at #, and #, since 2018. States she was physically fine and is 54 years old, the oldest one working there and now she&#39;s been back and forth from hospitals.  Caller states she was in # in the hospital with weakness 10Jun2021 or 07Jun2021. Caller states this has been a continuous thing going to hospitals for weakness, bladder is just letting go like just having uncontrollable urine, she got dehydrated. She only had to be inpatient at #Hospital in #. Caller states right after admitted there, primary doctors found a superficial blood clot in left leg and started her on #, and they discharged her and transferred her by from main hospital to the emergency room satellite. She was there to do an MRI and had to sedate her because she&#39;s claustrophobic. They found an L5 compression fracture, which caller clarifies is new since the shot. Caller states the back specialist said not going to do anything it, it will heal on it&#39;s own. Caller states she was sent to get her car and had a major allergic reaction to a drug given while in hospital but the nurse didn&#39;t listen, they let her drive her car from ##, which is satellite for # Hospital. States she stopped at a #, paid for Benadryl and had to park the car while she took two Benadryl for having major symptoms. Caller states when she felt she was ok, she drove back to hotel, but when she got there she couldn&#39;t get out of car so the manager called 911, and # they came and assessed her. Her cognitive level was fine, but she was sitting in urine and couldn&#39;t get out of car, so they rushed her to # Hospital and she was admitted on an orthopedic floor, this was 20May or 21May, and she went unresponsive while they were admitting her, so they coded her. States that she still has bruises on her ribcage. A cardiologist came and actually he listened to her. They did three different cat scans and determined that she now has arthritis in every bone ever broken. It&#39;s very painful. States that she is sitting with 5 piles of paperwork from 15Apr to her most current one which would have been at # Hospital just a couple of days ago. She has been diagnosed with so many different things because the doctor&#39;s couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on. Call handler attempted to query the name of the medication that caused her allergic reaction. Caller stated that there are 4 medications that she reacts to, two are muscle relaxers that she is allergic to, and one of them was given to her at # hospital. States that the problem is that people look at your mental disabilities first, they don&#39;t look at your other history, and nurses are over worked, so even though she told the nurse to call her doctor because she was having a major reaction and she knew what it was, they were still discharging her. Call handler again asked for the name of the product. Caller became upset and stated that she is physically in pain and is getting ready to pee herself right now. Caller started yelling that there are 5 medications that she is allergic to. No further details provided. Caller stated that the next call is going to the governor of #.

The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EW0169), at the age of 54 years old, in left arm on 23Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced some events. Caller stated she took the first shot on 23Apr2021, and didn&#39;t have too bad of reaction, just like a little bit of the flu. Caller stated in between first shot and just before the second shot, she had some reactions, and in and out of the hospital quite a few times, trying to figure out what was going on. Caller stated she was at hospital on 13Apr2021, 14Apr2021, and then 15Apr2021. Caller stated they had to code her, she&#39;d been unable to work, it had set off arthritis from the top of her head to the bottom of her feet, it&#39;s pretty much crippled her to point to where they&#39;d figured out that it was the covid shot that the side effects. Caller stated she just saw her family doctor yesterday, finally able to go in and see her physically, and she had piles of paperwork she&#39;d having to go through, and that was why she started back with paperwork from hospital, dated 15Apr2021. Caller stated she had the shot on 23Apr2021. Caller confirmed first shot was 23Apr2021. Caller stated there was more, it was just started a bunch of things, she was got stacks of papers, and she was sicker than a dog right now, because she got an infection just after, not sure if it was tied into this. Caller stated she was having trouble thinking at times, had caused nerve damage, where she could barely hold the phone. Caller stated she was pretty much grounded; this was the first time she&#39;d been able to get into her apartment, because she couldn&#39;t get up the stairs, so she had all the time in the world right now. Caller stated she was a home health aide, clarifies not a nurse. But she&#39;d recently been working, and was emailed papers for the type of leave for COVID-19, and extended leave of absence from work. Caller stated the last time she worked was 05Apr2021, seventh, ninth, tenth, something like that. Caller stated she could&#39;t think right now; she&#39;d in and out of it due to medications. Caller provided a health department as healthcare professional site. Caller added on 15Apr2021, she had family and her boyfriend, someone tested positive, so from 13Apr until 27Apr, she quarantined herself in a hotel, close to her work. Caller initially provided date of second dose as three weeks after first dose on 15May2021, but then clarified correct date as 14May2021. Caller stated she was just taking her normal medications, and stated she did not want to go through those at this minute. Caller stated she had an appointment to get first shot, but they spelled her name wrong, and a VIP thing had to be done. Before she went to get the shot she was trying to ask the medical doctor some questions because she had concerns, but before she could tell them any part of her history, the doctor just said to go ahead and gave her the shot. Caller stated the reason she got the number for Pfizer was from when, on 15Apr2021, they tested her for covid, and gave her instructions, she was off of work. Caller clarified she never got a phone call, when agent asked for test results of the test. Caller confirmed this test was done before her shot. Caller stated she got first shot and a couple days later, it was the normal flu-like body aches; she was told to got to store and get stuff for allergies, and for the flu, but she already had paracetamol and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) for allergies. Caller clarified she was told this by the site which gave the shot, had them sit down and wait 15-20 minutes, then let them go, and told them what to do. Caller stated these symptoms only lasted a couple of days. Caller stated that she didn&#39;t remember if she actually took the paracetamol and diphenhydramine hydrochloride as treatment for the flu-like body aches. Caller stated that she had all this paperwork that was going back to 15Apr2021, and she did not remember at the moment what she took for treatment of symptoms. Caller states she had everything journaled written down, stated in between the first and second shot, she was in and out of emergency rooms, trying to figure out what was going on. States she had to go back she was having reactions, she was in the emergency room for weakness, and other things, and had to be checked for blood clots, so she had to go back. She was there on 13May2021, 14May2021, they did a venous doppler on everything because she was having all kinds of pain in legs. Then on 15May2021, she had to go back to be checked for something, right after she got out of emergency room, and after she had the test, she was medically transferred to get the second shot (corrected on 14May2021), and after she got the second shot, it&#39;s been downhill from there. Caller stated she was admitted into a hospital and was in and out of the hospital. Caller stated she coded, they had to do CPR on her, and this had affected all of her nerves. Caller stated they gave both shots in her left arm and it had set off everything and all the nerve damage. Caller stated this was scaring her because she was the only family member who had the Pfizer shot. Everybody else was out of the state, and had the Johnson and Johnson or all the other vaccines, and she was the only one who&#39;d this shot, and the one who had the most damage. Call handler made multiple attempts to clarify information provided and get further details but asked to move on because all the questions were setting her off. Caller stated maybe she should have had the case worker call. Caller clarified she did not have arthritis prior to this.  Caller stated 31May2021, she was rushed to a hospital because she couldn&#39;t get up off the floor, they weren&#39;t sure what was going on with her, her bladder, so they put her on prednisone for a week. Caller did not finish statement regarding her bladder. Caller stated all hospitals she had been in, with exception of one. Caller provided a hospital when agent asked for spelling or clarification. Caller stated she could&#39;t hold the phone very long, and she can&#39;t sit up for very long either. Caller stated she had a hard time pronouncing the letters, when agent asked her to spell the hospital name. Caller stated the problem was agent was on a headset and her phone was set up for handicap for an ear that could&#39;t hear properly, so she stated the agent being on a headset was why agent could&#39;t hear her. Caller stated she had hearing loss and could&#39;t hear the consonants. Caller stated she was due to take medicine and could&#39;t take it while on the phone. Caller asked if there a fax number to fax the rest of this to. Caller stated all of the hospitals were all under a health, it was a whole medical group with all different hospitals in different towns. Caller stated prior to emergency room visit, she was in a hospital because she couldn&#39;t walk, was having trouble walking. She coded while they were admitting her; her heart stopped and they had to code her. Caller added she had not had a paycheck since 09Apr2021 or tenth, stated landlord hadn&#39;t thrown her out but she&#39;d close to being evicted because she hadn&#39;t worked, it was been determined the side effects have caused more damage. Caller stated 15Apr2021 she got Pfizer&#39;s phone number when she was tested for covid. Caller stated that was when they did the test, but she never heard anything back regarding the results of the test. She quarantined at a hotel and had to be away from work. Caller stated it was been a hospital where it started. Caller stated maybe agent needed to call back and finish report because she had all of hospital papers dissected with dates. Caller stated she was given a huge packet on 15Apr2021, when she was tested for covid. Went to the only local medical facility, and she went there on 15Apr2021 because her boyfriend&#39;s sons&#39; girlfriend tested positive, and they gave her a note for her work with instructions. Caller clarified they gave her a huge packet so that was where she got all the paperwork in Apr2021 before she got the shot. Caller stated after the first shot she had 48 hours of hot flashes, the chills, typical flu-like symptoms; only lasted 48 hours, and then from the twenty third she had different symptoms, and had been in an out of hospitals, trying to figure out what was going on with her. Caller stated she was healthy and working until 07Apr2021, 08Apr2021, or 09Apr2021, was the last time she worked. Then she quarantined from 13Apr2021 until 27Apr2021, and then they had to get vaccinated, so she registered, and when she went there, they spelled her name wrong, she started asking questions trying to give medical history before the shot. She had not given any of her history and doctor said to just give it. They gave the shot in her left arm and from then on, the damage hit and it has been one thing after another. Caller stated she previously had a test done in 2017, electrical shock from toes to head, and acupuncture same day, and only thing showed up was carpal tunnel in right and left hand. She was being treated with 1000 mg paracetamol, and she was fine working since 2018. Caller stated she was physically fine and is 54 years old, the oldest one working there and now she&#39;d been back and forth from hospitals. Caller stated she was in the hospital with weakness 10Jun2021 or 07Jun2021. Caller stated this had been a continuous thing going to hospitals for weakness, bladder is just letting go like just having uncontrollable urine, she got dehydrated. She only had to be inpatient at hospital. Caller stated right after admitted there, primary doctors found a superficial blood clot in left leg and started her on rivaroxaban (XARELTO), and they discharged her and transferred her by med car from main hospital to the emergency room satellite. She was there to do an MRI and had to sedate her because she was claustrophobic. They found an L5 compression fracture, which caller clarified was new since the shot. Caller stated the back specialist said not going to do anything it, it will heal on it was own. Caller stated she was sent to get her car and had a major allergic reaction to a drug given while in hospital but the nurse didn&#39;t listen, they let her drive her car, which is satellite for hospital. Caller stated she stopped, paid for diphenhydramine hydrochloride and had to park the car while she took two diphenhydramine hydrochloride for having major symptoms. Caller stated when she felt she was ok, she drove back to hotel, but when she got there, she couldn&#39;t get out of car so the manager called 911, and withheld came and assessed her. Her cognitive level was fine, but she was sitting in urine and couldn&#39;t get out of car, so they rushed her to a hospital and she was admitted on an orthopedic floor, this was 20May2021 or 21May2021, and she went unresponsive while they were admitting her, so they coded her. Caller stated that she still had bruises on her ribcage. A cardiologist came and actually he listened to her. They did three different cat scans and determined that she now has arthritis everywhere. It&#39;s very painful. States that she is sitting with 5 piles of paperwork from 15Apr to her most current one which would have been at hospital just a couple of days ago. She has been diagnosed with so many different things because the doctor&#39;s couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on. Call handler attempted to query the name of the medication that caused her allergic reaction. Caller stated that there are 4 medications that she reacts to, two are muscle relaxers that she was allergic to, and one of them was given to her at a hospital. Caller stated that the problem was that people looked at your mental disabilities first, they did&#39;t look at your other history, and nurses were over worked, so even though she told the nurse to call her doctor because she was having a major reaction and she knew what it was, they were still discharging her. Call handler again asked for the name of the product. Caller became upset and stated that she was physically in pain.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 55-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EP7533), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 07Apr2021 at 12:20 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome (from: Jan2021), ear trouble predating vaccination. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR) 10mg taken once daily by mouth for cholesterol (taking for two years), cholecalciferol 2000IU; take once daily by mouth for vitamin D low (taking for two or three years). There was no prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. On 07Apr2021 (A few minutes later, about 20 minutes after the vaccination), she felt dizzy and nauseous. Later on she noticed when she looked in the mirror, the right side of her face looked swollen. Adds her lips tingle a little bit at the same time as she got the dizziness and nausea. She called her doctor since this was immediately and not 24 hours later. Now weeks have passed and the right side of her face is still swollen; she is still dizzy and the nausea comes and goes. Adds her head felt heavy above her eyes too when she first felt the dizziness and nausea. It was reported that she went to the emergency room about week ago. They did a CT scan, EKG and drew blood and they told her the CT looks good; everything was normal except she had a minor UTI, urinary tract infection, and she was treated with antibiotics. Then later she went to visit her doctor and she said it looks probably like migraines triggered by the vaccine, and mentioned a lot of other theories, she can not remember them all. Adds she never gets the flu shot and the last vaccination she had was 30 years ago. Her doctor had a lot of theories and told her not to take any medication and to give her body a chance to recover. Caller added she also went to the dentist who did x rays and said everything looked fine. Then yesterday she went to the ENT, Ear, Nose and Throat specialist doctor for the dizziness and her face. The ENT doctor did some tests and said it was not vertigo or migraine because migraine comes and goes but hers does not go away. Then the ENT said he thinks it is inflammation of the jaw muscle. Caller adds her ear does not feel good sometimes. The ENT doctor said if connected jaws are not the same that can cause dizziness. He told her to take Aleve but she has not started it yet. She read somewhere today that in Israel other people have reported muscle inflammation, like heart muscle, and she is asking has that happened before with other people. The ENT also mentions she may be tightening her your teeth at night but she doesn&#39;t think she does that. Caller clarifies she had problems with her ear when she was very young and very rarely her ear is not comfortable when she sleeps on her side. But she does not sleep on her side anymore because her arms get numb. Adds she has carpal tunnel in both arms starting in Jan2021, predating treatment with the vaccine. Stated she was doing bike exercising and it caused the carpal tunnel. With regard to the swelling in the right side of her face, she stated no one can see it but if you touch it you can tell it is swollen and her husband can tell it was not big swollen but sometimes it gets bigger. Her doctor told her not to get the second dose until all the side effects go away or we know more. Mentioned her left arm was swollen from the carpal tunnel and the sports medicine doctor told her to take Advil. She took two weeks of Advil and her hand was fine. But then three weeks passed and her hand did not feel good again and looked a little swollen so she took Advil again for three days but she interrupted it 48 hours before the vaccine. She has not taken anymore Advil since then and she has not started it back. She was told to take ten 200mg daily but she only took two at lunch, one in the middle and one at night and it worked. The week before the vaccination, she took only 3 a day for 3 days then stopped it 48 hours before the vaccination. Provides for the Ibuprofen she took UPC 096619088041; lot SEP2021; expiration date P116896. This was the product she referred to as Advil. Caller asks isn&#39;t it the same thing. Caller mentioned she thought maybe it was a bad batch, referring to her vaccination, and adds she contacted someone that she knew who had the vaccine at the same location two hours later and they did not have any trouble; did not feel anything at all.

A 55-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 04May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8736) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history includes post-menopausal. The patient has a family history of low thyroid (mother). Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA-D 12HR) taken for an unspecified indication and paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH) taken for pain, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of Bnt162b2 on 13Apr2021 (lot number: ER8729) in the left arm for Covid-19 immunization. After she got the second dose in May2021, she did get very sick for about 48 hours, with a pounding head, nausea, and horrible body aches, cramps and shaking. She clarifies these symptoms lasted for about 24-48 hours. She has been much, much, much worse now since the second dose. It looks like some things were thrown off in the blood tests and stuff that were done in the ER. It&#39;s even showing that her thyroid is low and they immediately put her on Synthroid thyroid medication which made her a little nervous. She is not sure that what is showing up is something that is systemic with her or if this is something effecting what is systemic with her or if she is having some reaction. She is a little terrified right now to have her heart rate and blood pressure be up so much all the time. The level it was on Friday (209/100) scared her to death. Last Friday, after she took a shower, she was feeling like she was going to die. She does not know how else to explain it. She does have a blood pressure cuff and she decided to take her blood pressure. Her blood pressure was 209/100 and her heart rate was 125. Her blood pressure has been hovering around the 160s and 170&#39;s for the top number. She explains she and her doctors cannot get her to calm down. She called her doctor and she was sent to the Emergency Room. Some of the heart palpitation stuff and other things is coming in waves, it&#39;s not like its constant. But the blood pressure being elevated is constant. Also, when she has these waves, she also has perfused sweating. The waves last for about 5 minutes and the perfuse sweating takes a long time to stop. Her body is wet and she is instantly drenched. She is post-menopausal for like 2 years, it&#39;s not like hot flashes or anything weird showing up at the same time. She feels like she is in the middle of some sort of panic or anxiety attack 24 hours a day. She is also experiencing a lot of shaking and shivering. All of sudden, she gets violently hot and starts sweating profusely until she is drenched. She wakes up drenched in the middle of the night with her heart beating and high blood pressure, it wakes her up violently in the middle of the night. These symptoms have been continuing the entire time and she thinks it is getting worse. Friday was the highest her blood pressure has ever been. When she tried to use blood pressure cuff, her arm turned dark red, went numb and tingly, and she had tons of pain. She thought her arm was going to explode. She has never had that happen. She thinks the blood pressure was so high that the cuff caused that to happen. This made her think her blood pressure was close to heart attack level. Her blood pressure was 209/100 and her heart rate was 125. Her arm had never done that before. She clarifies she only went to the emergency room and she was never admitted into the hospital. She tried to get them to admit her because this has been going on so long and it&#39;s not correcting itself but they did not want to admit her. Clarified she went to the ER on Friday 14May2021. Several things were showing up weird in her blood tests. One of the things that showed up was that her thyroid was slightly low. She clarifies the TSH level was elevated, which meant hypothyroidism (thyroid is low). She was immediately put on Synthroid even though she was telling the doctors she was not so sure if what was happening to her was systemic and that it may be something that is exacerbated by or caused by the vaccine. She had to call into an endocrinologist because wanted her to see the endocrinologist immediately. In the hospital, her heart rate was okay while she was there, this kind of goes in waves. A wave of her heart beat going really, really hard and really, really fast. She states &#34;you can see it through my clothes&#34;. The sweating starts at the same time. However, on the regular, like at the time of report, she has been shaking and she can tell her blood pressure is elevated. She has taken her blood pressure twice this morning and it was in the 180s over 90s range and then in the 160/80&#39;s range. Constantly, she feels like her heart is racing around and her blood pressure is racing all day long. It feels like what an anxiety attack would feel like. It&#39;s like she just can&#39;t get her body to calm down. Her heart rate calms down a little bit, she is constantly hearing the pounding in her ears when her heart beats. She is just riled up all of the time and her chest is tight. It&#39;s not like a breathing issue, her body is just tight, it feels like when she is scared or alarmed. She also has become very irritable and having mood swings. She thinks that is more coming from her body feeling like her body is on high alert or overly sensitive. It feels like every little thing is gigantic. She has never felt that before. She is normally a fully high functioning person. Because her blood pressure is so high and this isn&#39;t stopping. She is literally debilitated and cannot function. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 14May2021 which included albumin globulin ratio: 1.1, lowest of recommended low, anion gap: 5, slightly low, blood glucose: 111, elevated, potassium: 3.4, slightly low, blood pressure measurement: 209/100, blood thyroid stimulating hormone: 3.820, slightly elevated (low thyroid), globulin: 3.9, slightly elevated, heart rate: 125, platelet count: 448, slightly elevated, protein total: 8.2 (right at recommended normal high level), blood UA positive 1&#43; and blood pressure measurement: 171/101; heart rate: 109 both on 17May2021. The patient added that her endocrinologist ran all of her tests last Sept2020 and her thyroid was not even an issue. Some traces of blood in the urine was found in blood UA. Nothing that should be causing that because there is no menstrual cycle or anything else they know is going on. The outcome of event chest tightness was not recovered; all other events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

The patient reports that she had a stroke several years ago but for some reason was told to not take aspirin and was not started on Plavix.  Irregardless, the patient came in with a very significant left-sided neurologic deficit.  She states that she could not speak, she had left facial droop, left arm weakness, and left leg weakness.  She initially had an NIH stroke scale in the emergency room of 11.  Initial CT of the head showed nothing acute.  Consultation with neurology was obtained and the patient was sent for a CTA of the head and neck.  No large vessel occlusion was identified and shortly after this the patient&#39;s NIH stroke scale reduced to 2 and shortly after this the neurologic deficit completely resolved and stroke scale return to 0.  At that point, the patient was diagnosed with a TIA and admitted to the hospital for observation.  This morning she states she feels fine.  She has no neurologic deficit whatsoever.  She denies any sensory or strength deficits this morning at all.  The patient sugars have been a little bit high, but otherwise she had an uneventful evening

                                                56 year old female presents with complaint of tingling and numbness that she noticed to her lower left jaw.  It occurred yesterday around 3 PM after she received her Covid vaccination.  She states that then started to move up to her left cheek but has now gone back down just to the lower left jaw.  It is in a specific region of that area.  She states also that she is having a fever today and generalized body aches that are moderate in nature.  She also notes some urinary frequency without dysuria or hematuria.  Patient took Tylenol this morning around 6 AM.  She initially tried to swallow the pill and felt like she was going to choke on it and spit the pill up.  She then sat down for a few minutes and was then able to take the pill.  She denies any actual stridor or wheezing.  No focal weakness or numbness of one arm or leg.  No change in speech. Differential diagnoses include but are not limited to: CVA, TIA, anxiety reaction, paresthesia, metabolic process, bleed, vaccine reaction.  56-year-old female with paresthesia to the left chin.  Otherwise normal neurologic examination.  The TPA window given symptoms started yesterday.  I will get a head CT but I do not feel the patient needs an MRI.  Given the fact the patient does have autoimmune disorder, blood cultures and lactic acid obtained.  I suspect that her fever is in response to her Covid vaccine yesterday.  Covid test negative.  Urinalysis no evidence of UTI.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Head CT negative.  On reevaluation after Motrin patient feels much improved.  At this time I think she is stable for discharge to home.  I do not think this is Bell&#39;s I am finding no facial weakness on my examination.  Follow-up and return precautions discussed patient understood

He examined my wrist and sent me for an X-ray, X-ray was negetaive. Monday 2/8 the pain was subsiding from my wrist and began to start in my L shoulder. Wed 2/10 The pain had moved under my breast radiating from my L front around my back, severe along with shortness of breath. I went to ER for a complete work up including a CT to rule out a blood clot. All test negative all blood work normal. Except it did reveal that I had a UTI. I have never had a UTI in my life. I was started on a anitibiotic for the UTI. I still have the pain under my L breast. Unknown reason.

                                                After about 15 min I started to get numbness, tingling , and swelling on my entire left side. It included difficulties seeing and lack of hearing on the left side. I could feel the &#34;blood flow&#34; in my head, which was super uncomfortable, because I was afraid of getting a stroke. I went to report to the Medical Doctor on side at the Convention Centre. They kept monitoring blood pressure and my responses. Nothing really was done. Symptoms stayed for about 1.5 hours the same. After that they decreased but  my side was still numb and swollen (not back to normal). However, I left to go home. After about 24 hours those symptoms were gone and only headache, fatigue remained. I received my second vaccination on 04/04/2021 at about 1:15P: Pfizer, Lot#ER8733 There, I used my right arm. Same thing, after about 15 min, I started to get tingling, numbness, difficulties hearing and seeing. Headache was worse than the first time. Again I remained under observation for about 1h. No results. Symptoms lessened. I went home. At night I developed nausea, severe kidney pain, had to vomit several times, and had a weird hot feeling inside my body=could feel my blood flow. It felt as if it was really hot. it was extremely scary, as I again was afraid of developing a stroke. Now, 2 days later, I still am feeling extremely weak, nauseous, headaches, some numbness.

                                                Within three minutes of getting the injection, I felt a surge, like adrenaline, going through my body, then my heart started pounding rapidly. I also had shallow breathing, like panting.  I drank water and it gradually subsided. As it subsided, I felt a tingling in the left corner of my mouth. It then went entirely numb. After ten minutes, my heartbeat went back to normal.  Also, although I had urinated at 6:10 p.m., I had to urinate again at 6:30. This was not due to drinking the water,  since I only drank about four ounces of water.

A 56-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6208), intramuscularly, on 09Mar2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received Adalimumab (HUMIRA 40MG/0.4ML, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen) at an unknown dose subcutaneously from an unspecified date in May2021 for rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included ear infection (started Jan2021), non-tobacco user, non alcohol user and sulfa drugs allergy manifested as rash. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6201), intramuscularly, on 16Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation with no reaction on previous exposure to vaccine. The patient&#39;s past medications include SULFA and Etanercept (ENBREL). In Jun2021, the patient experienced urinary tract infection and Escherichia coli infection. The patient went to an urgent care due to urinary tract infection on 09Jun2021. Physician asked her to skip Adalimumab when was informed about the infection. On 04Jun2021, therapy with Adalimumab was discontinued. She had a shot of COVID 19 vaccine before at least one symptom happened therefore COVID-19 VACCINE was considered as co-suspect product. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. The patient was treated with Clarithromycin (MACROBID). Relevant Laboratory &amp; Other Diagnostic Tests included Dipstick culture performed in Jun2021 that confirmed there was Escherichia coli and urinary tract infection. Outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events of urinary tract infection and Escherichia coli infection with BNT162B2 was not related and with Adalimumab was no reasonable possibility.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                5 days after my FIRST COVID shot, I experienced symptoms identical to what others have reported following the second shot:  extreme fatigue, headache, achiness, night sweats, and fever.  I did have a UTI at the time but I believe the symptoms are unrelated to that.  It was a mild UTI and cleared up quickly on antibiotics, while the other symptoms persisted for 3 days.

                                                developed kidney stone; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (who is also the patient). A 58-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0150), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 31Mar2021, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. On 06Apr2021, 6 days after the vaccination, the patient developed kidney stone which was a 6x2 mm stone. The patient stated that she never had a history of stone. She was wondering if anything has been reported like this and mentioned that she was unsure if this could be a side effect. The patient was recovering from the event. The patient reported the event as serious (medically significant).; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event kidney stone is considered unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162B2 as there is no known plausible mechanism. The reported event most likely represented intercurrent medical condition. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Really bad headache. I could not drink much even though I was thirsty. I could only do a small sip at a time or risk vomiting. My urine started to turn brown due to lack of hydration most likely. I was really sick for 3 days and mildly for 2. I still feel very weak and have brain fog.

                                                bladder infection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer via a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 58-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 13May2021, as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took penicillin for Lung stuff and experienced Anaphylaxis. On May2021, the patient experienced bladder infection. It was reported as received her first dose of the vaccine on 13May2021 and started taking antibiotics for a bladder infection on Monday. Her antibiotic regimen will last for 5 days. Reports her reaction to penicillin was a long time ago, she has asthma and was always treated with penicillin for lung stuff, but that was a long time ago. Caller states since then, she never took penicillin, even the pills, she tries to avoid that. Stated earlier she got the first dose of the vaccine and right now she was taking antibiotics and she was scheduled for the second dose on 03Jun2021. Transferring agent states the caller is wondering if that was okay if she can get the second dose. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information about batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0171), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Apr2021 as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included immune deficiency 2 months prior in 2021. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications include unspecified medications that the patient has been taking &#34;forever&#34;. The patient did not start any new medications recently. She did not have any other vaccinations the same day as the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine or in the four weeks prior. She says she hadn&#39;t had a vaccine in years. The patient reported that she got the vaccine then went grocery shopping and felt great, her arm didn&#39;t even hurt, and she didn&#39;t feel the shot going in. She says she went to bed and got up 4:00AM to get ready for work, and as soon as her alarm went off on 29Apr2021 she felt really weird. On 29Apr2021, she went to stand up and went to her knees since she couldn&#39;t walk and had to crawl to the bathroom. She was in the worst pain in her life/pretty bad pain. Her body was cramping. She was having cramps to her legs and just like every muscled from her foot to her hips and in her hips were cramping, severe cramping, the whole leg. She says she lost feeling and still has some numbness. Patient says her brain is a little foggy as well. The patient took pain medications and Neurontin which is helping her numb feet and tingling in extremities. She also had an icy feeling in her legs, though they are warm always although they feel icy, if she touches them they are warm, like normal body temperature. Patient clarified Neurontin as gabapentin 300 mg, says the doctor has started her out one at night before bed, and she just was given it, so she has only taken two days of it. She says they wanted to see how it affected her, and wanted her to call so they could decide how much to give her, so they started her at the lowest place. She says it didn&#39;t effect her worse than she already was, but she thinks they were holding off to see what the neurologist came up with too. The patient also had a little incontinence of bowel and bladder on an unspecified date in 2021. She says she went to the emergency room the day she woke up with the adverse reaction, on the &#34;29th&#34;. She says that they gave her Morphine IV. She says that they did no tests, or blood tests, then they sent her home with pain meds and said that this will probably get worse before it gets better, and to follow up with her doctor. She says she followed up with her doctor the next morning. She says that the pain meds made her sleepy, but did not take care of the pain. She says that she went to see her doctor, who sent her to a different hospital, and there she was admit from emergency. She was given an unspecified muscle relaxer which was the one she threw out, her pain wasn&#39;t muscle, it was nerve, so she threw it out. She was given Hydrocodone, substituted for Norco. They also gave her, maybe a Tramadol pill, in the hospital. She says she spent 7 days in the hospital, had two ER visits, and doctor visits. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included antinuclear antibody: positive 2 months prior in 2021. The patient had her &#34;proteins&#34; tested which were good and also did a spinal tap and were still good in her fluid  both on an unspecified date in 2021. The other neurologist wanted to do an EMG (not yet done), because sometimes it can still be fine and not higher proteins. She says mostly they have been going by her symptoms. She has not been diagnosed yet with Guillain-Barre, since she still needs to see a neurologist for the conduction study. She added she will consult with her neurologist, continue to take her Neurontin, and have the physical therapy. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Then started getting a strange side ache. Went to my doctor, I had a Bladder Infection ( I am not prone to either UTi,s or bladder infections) I still feel I need to go back to the doctor to follow up;  I don?t feel exactly right. Also definitely body aches that have lingered, lower energy levels and some brain fog. I waited to report because I had convinced myself that these symptoms were not related to the vaccine. But now I think they are. More and more people are reporting similar side effects.

A 58-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: EW0164; Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 14Jun2021 11:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not have prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Family Medical History included cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, kidney cancer, breast cancer. The patient previously took first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: EW0186) in left arm on 24May2021 13:00. The patient experienced cough on Jun2021, runny nose on an unspecified date, UTI (urinary tract infection) on 16Jun2021, slight headache on 17Jun2021, muscles hurt on 17Jun2021, little bit of chills on 17Jun2021, migraine headache on an unspecified date. Caller wanted to know if the adverse events that she is experiencing are included among the commonly reported adverse events from getting the Pfizer Biontech covid-19 vaccine. She was mostly concerned about the cough and runny nose. In response, patient was given overall safety summary that in clinical studies, adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older included fatigue (62.9%), and chills (31.9%). No specific information for coughs and runny nose being a effect, patient was referred to HCP. Caller stated that she was unsure if the cough and runny nose that she was experiencing were the signs of covid-19 or an AE of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19. The vaccine was at 95% efficacy 7 days after the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Biontech covid-19 vaccine. It may not protect everyone from covid-19. Patient was requested to speak to her doctor/hcp for some guidance as the cough/runny nose she was experiencing may require extensive evaluation to assess if it was an AE of the vaccine or a symptom of covid-19. Upon follow-up on 21Jun2021, patient reported additional events she experienced which included UTI, slight headache, muscles hurt, little bit of chills. Reason for the patient taking Covid Vaccine was that she was hearing a lot of announcements that Covid has been reported as decreasing. Patient had the second shot of the Covid vaccine on 14Jun2021. Her doctor prescribed her medication two days later for a UTI. She was just calling about this cough too and asked if that is normal after the Covid vaccine. She had a cough off and on and sometimes gets sniffles. She was going back to work the day later this report. She asked if that was okay since she had the shot last week. The medication the doctor gave her for the UTI was Nitrofurantoin and the next day to this report was her last day on it. She was taking 1 tablet twice a day. The cough started Saturday and it was off and on. She called Doctor&#39;s office, then she guessed her assistant called back and said she should call Pfizer and where she went to get the vaccine. She should ask them if it was normal to cough this way after the vaccine. Cough started the past Saturday or Sunday, 19Jun2021 or 20Jun2021. Thursday, she had a slight headache, her muscles hurt, and a little bit of chills. She slept all day. She still had a slight headache, but she was thinking that was because of the UTI medicine which can cause some headaches. She was trying not to take Tylenol or anything because she didn&#39;t want to kill the vaccine in her. It was not like a migraine headache, and she only feel it when she was sleeping. The muscle pain and chills went away on Friday, and she had recovered completely from both. She found out she had a UTI when she had her wellness visit and they gave her blood test results. She found out on Wednesday 16Jun2021. She didn&#39;t have any symptoms, they just found it during her annual visit. Everything as far as her other results were normal. That was the only thing they found. She was hearing a lot of announcements that Covid has been reported as decreasing and how it is safe to go back to work and those who are vaccinated can have no mask. It was reported that history included that the only medicine she was taking is the one for her UTI. She wanted to call because her boss said it was worse, she would have to call her primary physician, and he said to call administration site. When she had her lab results from her annual wellness visit, they found the UTI, she had no symptoms. Event onset time (24-hour clock) for slight headache, muscles hurt, chills was reported as 1500 or 1600 and for cough was towards the evening. AE(s) did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Patient was not hospitalized. Relevant tests included none. Clinical outcome of the events muscles hurt, little bit of chills recovered on 18Jun2021, events of cough, slight headache were not recovered and for the other events was unknown.

MEMORY ISSUES SUBSIDED TODAY, still brain fog, still RAPID HEARTBEAT and shaky.  If all of this brain fog/rapid heartbeat doesn&#39;t subside by Monday March 29, 2021, an EEG will be ordered to look at the brain.    I&#39;m on my 2nd weeks bedrest with no exercise and Tylenol every 6 hours, the tylenol every 6 hours seems to help with some of the brain fog and the rapid heart beat, if I forget to take it I am soon reminded as my heart races and the brain fog reappears.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6201; expiry: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 59-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient had no medical history, no concomitant medications and no investigation assessment. The patient experienced urinary tract infection in Mar2021 which was considered serious due to hospitalization from Mar2021 to Mar2021 for 5 days. She was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection. She didn&#39;t know who she was or what she was doing for 3 days. She was then kept an additional two days. The patient was supposed to go back on 12Mar2021 to receive the second dose. She was in the hospital at that time and did not receive the second dose. She was asking if she needed to start over since it was past the time for her to get the second dose. The event urinary tract infection required an emergency room visit. The outcome of the event urinary tract infection was recovered on 22Mar2021 while for disorientation was unknown.

                                                3 days after the first shot I felt achy lower back pain in the area of my kidneys.  10 days after, I felt feverish and woozy at the end of the day, and when I arrived home and took my temperature, it was 100.7. 20 minutes later, it was 101.6, which remains the highest recorded. By the time I went to bed about 3 hours later, it was back to 98.8.  The next morning at 9:00 am, it was 99.9 and hovered between there and 99.3 for most of the day. By 6:00 that evening, it had returned to 97.7, which is in my normal range.  I was tested for COVID during that day, and received a negative test result the next day.

A 59-year-old female patient (Non Pregnant at the time of vaccination) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 12:15 PM as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Graves Disease and seasonal allergy. Concomitant medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination included levothyroxine, liothyronine and seasonal allergy, etc. Allergies to medications, food, or other products: penicillin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Late night on Saturday 27Mar2021 23:45, the patient started getting cramps in abdomen, then she noticed blood in urine. Cramps subsided after Advil but work up the next morning with a blood flow. It&#39;s been 5 years since her last menstrual period, with very little spotting in those 5 years. It&#39;s been a week since the cramping and she was still getting dark (gross) spotting. This was very unusual for her body. Not sure if she should take the 2nd Pfizer shot. No treatment was received for the adverse event (except cramps in abdomen). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of cramps in abdomen was resolved with sequel. The outcome of others was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Cervical vertebra #8 through Lumbar vertebra #5 is very, very painful; in excruciating pain; muscle tenderness; muscle tightness; pain feels like someone kicked her in her kidneys; pain feels like it&#39;s punching her lungs; pain is a 10 plus in both flanks; back pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 20Apr2021 08:26 (Lot Number: ER8732) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, ongoing hypertension, ongoing mitral valve prolapse, ongoing Tarlov cysts and ongoing mobility issues and problems standing and sitting. The patient had a neurological condition caused Tarlov Cysts. These cysts populated right outside of the dorsal root nerve system. In her, it&#39;s cervical vertebra #5 all the way down her spine bilaterally. In May2018, she had a surgical procedure, not an aspiration, for 8 of the nerves in her sacrum. She has had complications ever since. Cervical vertebra #7 and #8 have been giving her the most problems.  Concomitant medications included ongoing oxycodone hydrochloride, oxycodone terephthalate, paracetamol (PERCOCET) 10mg every 4 hours taken for pain, and her doctor recently changed it; ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL) injection and something for acid reflux but she did not think that&#39;s relevant. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EN6208) in arm right on 16Mar2021 9:48AM for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 59-year-old and she had no problems just soreness in her arm. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. She had her second Covid 19 vaccine yesterday morning, 20Apr2021. Cervical vertebra #8 through Lumbar vertebra #5 was very, very painful from 20Apr2021. She didn&#39;t know or hasn&#39;t heard if the Covid 19 vaccine is associated with her back pain. This pain that she&#39;s having now didn&#39;t feel like the pain she had related to her Tarlov cysts.  Before the Covid 19 vaccine she had no problems until late last night (20Apr2021) and early this morning (21Apr2021). She was in excruciating pain. She reported it&#39;s complicated for her to make that mind adjustment. She texted her cousin this morning at 6:30AM (21Apr2021) because she had to let her cousin know what was going on. If her cousin texts and she doesn&#39;t respond, her cousin will do a welfare check. She doesn&#39;t want a welfare check so she told her cousin to just let her sleep, let her see how she feels when she&#39;s up again. She reported sometimes when the Tarlov cysts were bothering her she could lay on her back and it would soothe her pain. This time that was not working. She reported she had her vertebra and her discs and then her outer muscular system to the flank, that is where it was painful. She didn&#39;t know if this is normal. She was hearing normal side effects like tiredness and fatigue, she was not having those because she was not normal. She was 1 in 2 billion with her Tarlov cysts. She has complications with her Tarlov cysts. She has mobility issues and problems standing and sitting. She has Tarlov cysts from Cervical vertebra #5 bilaterally down. She had multiple cysts. She didn&#39;t know if the Covid 19 vaccine was aggravating her back. She reported she has 2 nervous systems, her parasympathetic and her sympathetic nervous system. She reported this is in her parasympathetic nervous system. She reported sensory, if she touches something hot, she knew it was hot. She reported this is so important. She had muscle tenderness and muscle tightness from 20Apr2021and that&#39;s it. She knew what she was taking about because she was using medical terminology. The pain felt like someone kicked her in her kidneys. The kidneys, where the waist is on her back to the top of her sacral area and up the spine to where her first rib is and go outward, that&#39;s where her pain was, from thoracic vertebra 12 to lumbar 5.  The only different thing she&#39;s done was get the Covid 19 vaccine. She was trying to triage herself. She didn&#39;t know what else to do. The Percocet was not even fixing it. She wanted to make sure the Covid 19 vaccine wasn&#39;t exacerbating her disease. She thought that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. She was in a lot of pain. Her pain was the same before and after when she took the Percocet. Normally the Percocet calmed her down to where she&#39;s functional and the Percocet was not. Percocet was 10-325mg, oxycodone and acetaminophen. Take one 4 times daily as needed for pain. The Percocet was a pharmacy bottle. In order for her to have a quality of life she also took Ketorolac or Toradol. She hadn&#39;t taken that today (21Apr2021). She picked her prescriptions up at the same time she received her Covid 19 vaccine.  She can lay on the ground on her back sometimes and her pain will be alleviated. Now laying on her back exacerbates her pain. She didn&#39;t know if it&#39;s muscular. If she was diagnosing herself, she would say it&#39;s not muscular. She knew enough about Tarlov cysts that she knew how to rule it out. She reported her felt feels like it&#39;s punching her lungs.  She reported it&#39;s so hard to explain. She&#39;s trying to separate the pain she has from her Tarlov cysts from what she&#39;s experiencing now. She reported her pain was a 10 plus in both flanks. She stated people will call flanks &#34;the sides&#34;. The only reason she knows it&#39;s a flank is because she had learn anatomy real quick with her Tarlov cysts. On the date of her first Covid 19 vaccine she had a steroid injection and a Toradol injection. With her second Covid 19 vaccine she had a Toradol injection. The pharmacist told her there would be no conflict in receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. she has to suffer through it until her pain subsides. It feels like it&#39;s kicking the heck out of her back. When she lays supine she can alleviate some of the pain associated with the Tarlov cysts but that&#39;s not working.  She can&#39;t stand or lay supine, all of that is out the window. Meaning it&#39;s not working. This pain has to be the Covid 19 vaccine. She&#39;s in a lot of pain and she didn&#39;t need the vaccine to exacerbate her pain. There were no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. The adverse events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Patient had IV fluid initiated wide open and CT scan was obtained of head chest abdomen pelvis given the fact that her altered mental status could be from some kind of intracerebral catastrophe and the patient&#39;s abdominal exam being unobtainable certainly possible that her GI bleeding could be from a perforated viscus.  CT scan of the brain does not demonstrate any stroke that appears to be acute however there may be some ischemia present although it may be remote and an MRI will need to be done when the patient is more stable.  CT of the chest abdomen pelvis shows what is likely an aspiration pneumonia on the right as well as a perforated viscus in her abdomen.  Radiology feels is probably somewhere in the right colon terminal ileum.  At this point the patient was given Cipro and Flagyl and that should also aid with her aspiration pneumonia.  Her blood pressure did start to decrease her temperature was noted to be elevated at 101.8.  She was given Tylenol rectally and fluids were allowed to run wide open.

Most of the small intestine and large intestine was affected. o Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, ICG injection for evaluation of perfusion  Indication and Consent  Findings: . Findings: Even after the ICG injection.  There was spotty tissue necrosis from mid jejunum all the way through sigmoid colon.  Most areas were blackened with a foul smell.  There was some highlighted areas secondary to the ICG but not a significant amount that would lend for an anastomosis.  Black ascites was present throughout the abdomen.  Unfortunately after much contemplation there was no surgical intervention.   Procedure  Procedure: Patient was placed in supine position.  Was intubated in the emergency room so, we were able to proceed with resuscitation through our anesthesia team.  Patient&#39;s abdomen was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Proceeded to make a midline incision.  The blood supply in the subcutaneous tissues did not even bleed.  Appeared to be darkened and almost coagulated.  As we entered through the fascia we were able to open the peritoneum between 2 hemostats.  The large rush of free air through from the abdomen.  We then proceeded to open the abdomen for the length of her incision.  This was done with electrocautery.  From here there was a black ascites present within the abdomen.  There was a large amount of dead intestine that we could immediately see.  I worked my way to the ligament of Treitz.  There was no adhesions so this was easily found.  That intestine did appear to be pink.  It lasted for about a foot.  After that area everything was either black or purple in color with a few pink spots in between.  This went all the way down to the terminal ileum where pneumatosis was visualized.  We then looked at the colon from cecum through rectum.  It appeared to be blackened as well.  Not knowing whether all of this intestine was dead or not especially with patient being hypotensive I injected ICG dye approximately 2 cc.  This was to evaluate perfusion.  Unfortunately perfusion was no better than what I could visualize.  I could not even find enough room of the colon or small intestine to make an anastomosis.  Was very hard decision, however, we did not resect any bowel.  I closed the patient&#39;s abdomen.  Patient will be taken to ICU on ventilator.  Discussed with daughter with pastor present.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received via medical information from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s spouse). A 59-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: ER8729), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Apr2021 (at the age of 59-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced shingles and kidney function is impaired. The clinical course of events was as follows: The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 07Apr2021 and was diagnosed with shingles 3 days later (10Apr2021). The reporter stated that  the patient&#39;s kidney function is impaired when the doctor ran lipid panels (unknown results) and urine panels in which the patient had &#34;strange, high readings&#34; on 10Apr2021 with her BUN was 26 (High), referencing at 24; creatinine level was 1.54 mg (High), referencing 1.00 mg; GFR (glomerular filtration rate) filtration rate was 37 ml/second (abnormal), referencing at &gt;59 ml/second. The reporter stated she received more testing on 28Apr2021, in which the lab values had improved, but have not returned to her baseline on 28Apr2021 with her GFR was 64 ml/second (normal) and creatinine was 0.97 mg/deciliter (borderline). The reporter stated her GFR in November(2020) was 96 ml/second (Normal) and her lab values were all within normal range at her last doctor&#39;s appointment on 01Dec2020. The reporter states the only thing that has changed in her regimen was receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. He is concerned if his wife will make a full recovery and if her kidneys are damaged due to the vaccine. The patient has not fully recovered from shingles and still has aches, pains, and skin lesions that have not fully disappeared. He was also asking if she needs to recover fully before receiving the second dose. The clinical outcomes of the event &#34;kidney is impaired&#34; was resolving while the event &#34;shingles&#34; was not resolved.
