                                                I was 34 weeks at the time of vaccination. Initially, I only had pain at the injection site. I woke up the next day with diarrhea that lasted about 6 days. I had no other symptoms besides dehydration and back pain. On Day 3, I was instructed to take Imodium, which I took for about 2 days, but it didn&#39;t help. Around Day 5, I was given fluids, my urine was tested and multiple GI tests were run. I was placed on antibiotics for a UTI. PVCs were also discovered at visit, but it&#39;s not connected to the vaccine.

                                                Fifteen minutes following injection, the left arm broke out in hives and had numbness and tingling. Then I became dizzy and pale. I was laid down and vital signs were taken. My heart rate was in the 110s and 120s and stayed elevated for about four hours. The hives resolved and did not spread to the bilateral arm or anywhere else. The following two days I felt incredibly weak and had urinary frequency. I was told to go to the hospital by the health clinic staff but I declined.

Fever has diminished but the symptom that worries me the most is the color pink on my urine.

                                                3/18: Chest pain. It woke me up in the middle of the night with some dizziness. At first, I disregarded it, then I tried falling asleep again, but I was jolted awake again with worse symptoms - vertigo, palpitations. I measured my HR, it was all over the place and irregular. Went to the ER, they didnt find anything substantial on my EKG other than arrhythmia with short PR. No treatment was given, instructed to follow up with PCP. Left ER between 4AM-5AM. Was able to go back to sleep, but the chest pain woke me up around 7 AM. The chest pain remained fairly constant with severity changing throughout the day. Symptoms were worse at night and more: inability to sleep, sometimes restlessness - the need to move, increased chest pain/tightness/burning, palpitations. Saw PCP on 3/19, she didnt have any of the lab results, but prescribed metoprolol - this medication was misunderstood as to when I was supposed to take it, therefore didnt start it until another visit that I had with my PCP on 3/22. Over the weekend, I took some ibuprofen to try to lessen the chest pain, it helped a little bit but not for long. Began taking metoprolol 3/22. I didnt sleep more than 2-3 hrs from 3/18-3/22

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 28-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 06May2021 11:00 (Batch/Lot number: EW0170) as 2nd dose, single, at the age of 28-years-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnant. The patient had no known allergies. Medical history included a few kidney stones and one surgery to remove stones. She reported she was very healthy and active otherwise and hadn&#39;t had any sort of cold or illness in 2 years. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), on 15Apr2021 09:45 AM in the left arm as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not have any other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. At 06May2021 9:00pm (10 hours after her 2nd shot), she started having a low grade fever, congestion, and chills. She went to sleep at 12:00am, chills and fever were more intense at this point. At 2:00am on 07May2021, she woke up with a fever of 103, no chills, but intense ear ringing (a volume of 9/10) in her left ear, extreme stomach and kidney pain, nausea, and achiness. The ringing in her ears was the worst symptom. She sat up and drank water for the next 5 hours, to try to get the inflammation down. She went to the bathroom every hour and her ear ringing started to lessen. At 7:00am she went to the bathroom for the 5th time and began to feel extremely light headed. She had a vasovagal response and collapsed/fainted (luckily, she had a family member who was monitoring her). She went back to rest and have had on and off low-grade fever, some chest pain, and aches since then. She has a twin sister, who got her shot on the same day and time, and she also had a vasovagal response, but not nearly as many of the other symptoms. The patient had no prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post-vaccination. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I don&#39;t like to take medicine and I had no choice but take Panadol every 4 hours and apply ice to treat the muscular pain. I went to emergency and was told that I had an urine infection  (which is very rare on me), and was treated with antibiotics.   With the second dose I took acetaminophen 500 mg befor the vaccine, that helped because the day of the shot I didn&#39;t have pain, but the numbness was like if I couldn&#39;t connect my body to the brain. Couldn&#39;t talk properly, sleep 2 hours during the day, is funny that I applied ice on the injection site (Me thinking) but the pain doesn&#39;t go away, when the ice melts I notice that I applied the ice on the wrong arm. That&#39;s what I mean when I talk about numbness. Fever of 39.8F and Chills even today . Some cough and dry throat (Dryness can be because I&#39;m a teacher) and constant tiredness.

Side effects began 2 days after her 2nd COVID vaccine. Pt was transferred to hospital from another institution due to O2 sat in the 60s (room air), leukocytosis, and AKI. Patient was treated empirically for sepsis/pneumonia as well as lupus flare. She was also initiated on high dose steroids. Possible reaction to vaccine. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and no signs of pulmonary embolism. Pt was transferred from hospital to another facility given progressive organ failure, most specifically liver failure.

                                                I received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday April 9th at 6pm. I did not feel any adverse effects beyond arm soreness around the injection site until the morning of Sunday April 11th, at which point I had exacerbated joint pain (likely an inflammation response). In the evening of the 11th, I noticed the soft tissues of both my mouth and vulva felt more raw/sensitive than usual. On the 12th this feeling persisted, with canker sores/mouth ulcers forming in my mouth/throat and a continued stinging/irritated feeling in my vulva. On the 13th this manifested as vulval ulcers, which were painful on their own and with pain dramatically increased while urinating. During the night of the 13th/morning of 14th I also woke up several times feeling either chilly/clammy or overheated, and took 800mg ibuprofen and slept through to the morning of the 14th. By the time I woke up I no longer had chills/fever symptom, but mouth and vulval ulcers had both progressed. The appearance of the vulval ulcers was crater-like patches with a white coloration surrounded by raised red rims, with several touching/against each other and surrounding tissue also inflamed/sensitive. On the 15th I made an appointment with urgent care as I was unable to use the bathroom without extreme pain and was unable to wipe the area and had to rinse in the shower to stay clean instead. From the Urgent Care clinician I was prescribed a 5% topical lidocaine ointment, a 4% over the counter lidocaine alternative option, and an antiviral course of Acyclovir. Bloodwork was done to rule out STIs. Applying the ointment 4-5 times a day before using the bathroom was the most effective part of treatment, although constant discomfort and inability to wear tight clothing/wash the area normally persisted for the following week. At peak, there were 10 visible ulcers ranging from 0.3cm-0.8cm in diameter, located on both inside sides of the labia and with some presenting as &#34;kissing sores&#34;. After April 20th, they slowly grew smaller and began to recede although intense pain persisted. At this point my mouth sores had also diminished and were fading at a faster rate than the vulvar sores, with minimal disruption to function besides avoiding particularly sharp/spicy/salty foods. I kept up use of the topical numbing cream on the vulvar ulcers until April 26th, at which point most sores had healed and I was able to urinate and bathe in a normal manor, although I still needed to be gentle/the area still felt sensitive. At the time of writing this report (April 28th), I still see some redness/potential scarring but there are no longer open sores and there is no noticeable pain/sensitivity.

                                                The morning after my vaccine (5/18/2021), I woke up with a mild headache and achiness in my joints. I took ibuprofen to alleviate the pain and my headache came back later that afternoon. I started feeling nauseous in the evening before going to bed.  The following morning (5/19/2021), I woke up with the same headache and was feeling nauseous still. After about an hour, I got out of bed thinking I was going to vomit. I was sitting on the bathroom floor and became lightheaded and my stomach started hurting worse. I got tunnel vision  and passed out. My boyfriend was there and said that I started seizing for about 10 seconds and was cold. He said that I started to urinate and then regained consciousness after about 15 seconds. He called 911. I felt shaky and dizzy for about 15 min after. The ambulance showed up. My blood pressure was low, blood sugar was good, heart rate was good. I was able to walk to the ambulance and they took me to the ER. They gave me anti-nausea medication and fluids via IV. At the hospital, I received a CT scan for my head and another to check for clots in my lungs. Both tests came back negative. I had chills and body aches and was extremely tired.  After about a couple of hours, I started feeling nauseous again and they gave me more anti-nausea medication. They did a urine sample and said I had a UTI, but other than that there was nothing wrong. They referred me to a neurologist to follow up about the seizure. They prescribed an antibiotic for the UTI and anti-nausea medication and I was discharged after about 5 hours.

I had a high resting heart rate (100&#43;) with shortness of breath and went to the Emergency Department two days after receiving the vaccine (04/29/2021). They gave me fluids and monitored my heart rate until it came down into the 80s. However, since then, I have continued to have a high resting heart rate with occasional chest tightness and followed up with my primary care doctor who recommended seeing a cardiologist. On 05/09/2021, I also had a skin rash on my face, lips, arms, and hands (I think part of my chest/abdomen as well). I went to the Immediate Care Center and was prescribed hydroxyzine. With the medication, the rash went away within a few days.

                                                Patient was found unresponsive at home on 5/22, admitted to another institution, found to be in DKA, multisystem organ failure (renal failure, liver failure), new R femoral DVT, elevation of ferritin, LDH and CRP.  Over the course, platelet count continues to drop while on anticoagulation, and continued progression of thrombi, and transferred to our institution for further workup, including hepatic failure, concern for HLH and Castro trophic antiphospholipid syndrome.  Based on chart review, patient had non-specific symptoms for a few weeks prior to the presentation, including GI distress, dysphagia and neck/sinus pain.  CTH done with cerebral edema but not intracranial venous thrombosis.  CT chest and abdomen with no PE, but presence of R popliteal vein thrombus, and portal vein thrombus.  Heparin Ab (PF4 -ELISA test) was negative (at both referring  hospital and current hospital).  Serotonin release assay is pending at the time of report.  While the symptoms are not consistent VITT that were reported (Heparin ab negative, received mRNA vaccines), however this possibility cannot be ruled out.  IVIG was started on 5/27 - 5/28 to treat empirically for concern for heparin induced thrombocytopenia vs VITT.

Feber has subsided.  Cough, shortness of breath and intermittent wheezing remain as well as some chest pressure, sore throat, headache and chills. Coughing fits are bad enough to cause urinary incontinence but I did give birth 4 months ago so this may not be significant. No signs of allergic reactive such as redness, urticaria or swelling.

                                                hives all over body; UTI; huge cold sore on nose; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other HCP (patient). A non-pregnant 31-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration at Left Arm on 26Jan2021 17:30 (at age of 31 years old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies: Sulfa. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC); vitamin d nos; clarithromycin (MACROBID).

No COVID prior vaccination. Nasal Swab on 09Mar2021 was Negative. On 26Jan2021 09:00 PM, within 5 hours of getting my second vaccination, patient broke out in hives all over body. Patient called doctor and was prescribed steroids to help with the hives as antihistamines were not helping. A few days later patient woke up with a huge cold sore on nose which patient never had before. The same day patient was experiencing symptoms of a UTI and was prescribed Macrobid which had taken several times before. Within an hour of taking it patient&#39;s body was covered in hives and throat started to close. Patient immediately went to urgent care where received a shot of Benadryl. Patient was confident this reaction would not have happened if patient had not had this vaccine. AE resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Treatment (Prednisone and a shot of Benadryl) received. The outcome of the events was recovered in 2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Hives, UTI, Cold sores cannot be excluded.

A 32-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 13Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient reported that on 27Jan2021, exactly 2 weeks after the 1st dose of the vaccine, she came down with a UTI and bladder infection which caused her to have blood in her urine. This also happened to the patient&#39;s father who suffered the same thing 2 weeks after his first vaccine. Antibiotic was given as treatment for the patient. Lab data include nasal swab COVID test: negative on 18Jan2021. The outcome of the events was recovered in 2021.

                                                A few weeks after the vaccine I noticed my legs were covered in Peticia which began spreading up the legs.  I was sent to the ER for a CBC but was sent home.  My Dermatatologist performed 2 Punch Biosypies.  I began having joint pains in my legs and stomach pains.  The peticia begin going and coming.  And the test results for the Punch Biopsies revealed I had HSP &#34;Henoch Schonline&#34;.  I began having GI issues with bloody stool, blood in my urine which prompted I be started on a high dose Steroid of Prednisone. On 3/24 I saw a Nephrologist who advised there was still blood in my urine and a  kidney biopsy may have to be perfomed if the steroids does not improve or resolve the issue.  Ive been having nose bleeding also but is unsure if its associated as well and I am scheduled to see and ENT for on 4/2 for that.

                                                2 days after the first vaccination I had pain while urinating, lower back pain on the right side pain just below the ribs and the kidney area on the right side and right side pelvic pain, lower abdomin pain around bladder area. Doctor thought it could be a UTI so I was prescribed antibiotics I&#39;ve never had a UTI. After finishing the antibiotics there is no relief pain was worse. I received the second vaccination on 4/28. After receiving that vaccination my left side started hurting and the right side pain continued. After much testing with no results that came up with any issues I was sent to see a urologist. Who after hearing my symptoms and the timing of them believed that it was an adverse effect to receiving the covid vaccination. He put me on some pain medication to help me sleep as I had not slept in a month and now I am feeling much better. Symptoms started on 4/9 and it is now 5/27 and I am starting to feel normal again.

I then had a UTI. I went to Urgent Care and I was prescribed Bactrim. A few days after that, I had a fever. My face felt like it was on fire on the left side. I went to Urgent Care again. I was told I had Covid-19, but the test came back negative. I was given Cipril afterwards. Every time I stood up I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe. I was then put on Prednisone. I couldn&#39;t breathe well after that. I was then diagnosed with bronchitis. I called my doctor again and I took another Covid test. It came back negative.

However the second dose was given Thursday, January 21. The progressing of the itchy hands and feet lead to my bottom lip swelling excessively large , my tongue begin to swell, my upper lip begin to swell, my lungs begin to burn in my airway begin to tighten. I took two Benadryl and called my family to call 911 and take me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was very low pulse was very high. I had genital pain and swelling, dizziness , nausea vomiting, and extreme body pain. I was given epinephrine, breathing treatments, steroids, Benadryl, and IV fluids. Labs were drawn and my creatinine was high. After about four hours the swelling has gone down and I was able to go home. I have to take steroids for three days, Benadryl for seven , and famotidine.  I have no history of severe allergies, in fact I was tested for food and environmental allergies about a year ago and everything came back negative. I have no history of reacting to any vaccine at any time.

                                                This is a 37 y.o. woman who developed an episode of acute self-limited hemolysis just over a week following her second injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine immediately prior to the episode for a urinary tract infection.  She had no history of hemolysis prior to this episode.  She was in her usual state of health and received COVID-19 vaccines on 12/24 and 1/14 with the Pfizer vaccine and had no serious side effects at that time.  She then developed dysuria and was seen by telehleath by her primary care physician who prescribed ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine for her for 3 days ending 1/22.  She took these and her dysuria resolved, however the day after developed what appeared to be blood in her urine.  Then in the following 2 days which were a weekend this worsened and she started feeling poorly.  She also noted that she appeared yellow.  On Monday 1/25 her boyfriend took her to urgent care and she was subsequently sent to an ER at the hospital that referred her to our hospital.  There she was evaluated for gross hematuria with no evidence of urinary bleeding and found to be anemic due to hemolysis.  Her hemoglobin was in the 5&#39;s and she received 2 units of PRBCs.  She was transferred here to Medical Center for further management.  After the initial transfusion she did not require blood transfusion and her hemoglobin continued to increase until it was 10.4 on 2/1 which was the day of discharge.  At a follow up appointment on 2/8/2021 she was recovering and feeling well.   Her jaundice had resolved.   No treatment was given from the hemolysis aside from the blood transfusion and it was self-limited.  It is most likely that her acute hemolysis was due to the phenazopyridine as this agent is known to cause hemolysis and she took it for 3 days prior to the onset of hemolysis.  She has no prior history of drug induced hemolysis and had not taken this medication previously.  As this occurred just over a week following her second vaccination I cannot exclude that is could be related to the vaccine.

                                                Within minutes I had pin prick red dots on my right arm. We were at a drive through clinic waiting the 15 minutes in the parking lot before leaving and had the paramedic from the ambulance come look. I leaned into the seat to let my husband photograph my dots, and where my shoulder was leaning into the seat, I immediately had a smattering of red pin prick dots. They began showing on my left arm. We were advised to go to the ER. My hemoglobin was fine (though clotting factors were off), and he?d see a few reactions like that, so we were sent home.   I had diarrhea, abdominal pain, and severe nausea, but nothing scary or bad.   I woke to not being able to urinate, and that was followed with complete incontinence. I cannot control my bladder at all, cannot urinate on demand, and often don?t realize I?m urinating until I feel the warm gush.

                                                Evening of 1-17-21 felt like I was having horrible vaginal infection symptoms. Saw a primary care physician on 1-18-21 and was found to have a raging yeast infection, bacterial vaginitis and urinary tract infection. I haven&#39;t had any of these in 15&#43; years. I was started on antibiotics. Next morning (1-19-21) felt extreme lower abdominal fullness and pressure and extreme nausea. I got in with my OBGYN at 9am same day and he discovered I had an ovarian cyst. He sent me down for an ultrasound and the results showed I had a ruptured ovarian cyst on my left side and an ovarian cyst on my right side. I have never had an ovarian cyst in my life. The next day (1-20-21) the right cyst ruptured. Having all three infections and two ovarian cysts (when I&#39;ve never had one before) lead my OBGYN and I to feel it warranted filing a VARES report

Starting Thursday morning I had very minimal urine output for18 hours. I also had flank pain. During this time I also had a fever, body aches, etc. I am an ED nurse and knew to hydrate myself. I hydrated all day and evening. Thursday night I had no urine output for 6&#43; hours. Starting Friday morning I had minimal urine output and it was brown tinged. As the day progressed my output increased slowly and changed from brown to pink/orange. I continued to hydrate drastically. Saturday morning my urine was pale yellow and clear and my pain was gone. I believe I had an acute kidney injury.  Fortunately I knew to drastically hydrate and maintain that.

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

                                                The day I received the vaccine, I noticed that I feel thirsty later in the day. I didn&#39;t really take much into it and it seemed to be ok the next couple days. 5 days later, I woke up to extreme thirst and a very salty taste in my mouth. This continued until the day after two weeks after receiving the 2nd dose. It has now gone away so I think it was related. My doctor ran my AIC (fasting and not) the first week and several blood work on electrolytes, thyroid etc. Everything was normal and my blood sugar is controlled (as it was before the vaccine). I also had COVID in December (a mild case) and recovered fully. I also noted my urine was yellow (not scary, hospital) yellow but dark. No matter how much water I drank, it did not change. I also drank Gatorade etc. and that didn&#39;t change anything. After receiving the 2nd dose, two weeks later is when I noticed it start to be a little better and then two more days later, it went away.

I made an appointment with my gyn on 4/23 and followed up with a visit to an urgent care center on 4/24.

A 39-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 20Apr2021 at 19:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and pregabalin (LYRICA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at 100 mg, 3x/day for neuropathy. Medical history included neuropathy from 2020 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient got the vaccine and she was taking pregabalin as well and after vaccination, she experienced an adverse event, her legs were heavy and numb and also her bladder was now the problem she was actually now at the emergency room. Patient was a little nervous. The patient was still in the hospital and she was not getting any care. What happened at the beginning was that she totally became paralyzed from the waist down, when your foot fall asleep you get painful tingling feeling she have that kind of feeling in her legs not able to move any part of her anywhere from her waist down later on that night, after she took pregabalin, went to sleep about an hour she was able to move her left toes and able to drag one leg a little bit. She was supposed to take pregabalin 3 times a day and they were giving her a difficult time about it, she took one at 12 O&#39; clock on Wednesday and the hospital they did not give another one until 11 o clock that evening because she was supposed to take 3 times a day. After she no longer feel from the waist down, she took a pregabalin and it didn&#39;t help her it didn&#39;t work and her physician told her to take 3 times a day and then at 10 O&#39; clock yesterday morning she was still asking the hospital to give her another one. When asked to repeat the concern, patient stated &#34;weakness in her legs that felt very heavy like she was dragging. The date of hospitalization was reported as 21Apr2021. The reason for hospitalization was reported as numbness in her legs and weakness in legs, became paralyzed from the waist down, and her kidneys. So her brain doesn&#39;t tell the body to go to the bathroom she is leaking because the bladder is filling up filling over and the body doesn&#39;t know to get it out its leaking because it is filling up it is so full. The patient underwent lab test in the hospital. The action taken with pregabalin in response to the events was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 39-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EWO171 Expiry date: Unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 25May2021 as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included quadriplegic cerebral palsy (she was born with this), heart beats fast; she has always had this. Concomitant medications included vitamin c:ascorbic (500); buspirone(200 mg) taken for pain; ibuprofen. The patient experienced pampers were grey, like grey pee on May2021. Caller stated that she was calling about her daughter. Caller confirms she was calling about the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. The day before yesterday, her daughter got the Pfizer vaccine and she had quadriplegic cerebral palsy and did not walk or sit. Caller noticed that her daughter wears pampers and it was grey. It was grey, like pee, or whatever. The Pamper was grey. There was no blood or anything, it was just greyish. States she has nothing else to add to the report and that her daughter just told her, ma, you and people to the bathroom and pee. Adds that she, the caller, took the shot and nothing happened to her and her friends but her daughter said that they were peeing in the bathroom and do not look at their urine to see if it was grey and when it was in the water. It was noticeable because her daughter was in a Pamper, she uses Pampers and not the bathroom. Stated that her daughter had been on these for years. Caller just wants to make sure this was reported, because she was so scared and said maybe people urinate in the bathroom and they do not notice because it goes into the water. The outcome of event was not recovered.   Information on lot/batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.
