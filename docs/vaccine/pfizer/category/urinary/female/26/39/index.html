                                                I was 34 weeks at the time of vaccination. Initially, I only had pain at the injection site. I woke up the next day with diarrhea that lasted about 6 days. I had no other symptoms besides dehydration and back pain. On Day 3, I was instructed to take Imodium, which I took for about 2 days, but it didn&#39;t help. Around Day 5, I was given fluids, my urine was tested and multiple GI tests were run. I was placed on antibiotics for a UTI. PVCs were also discovered at visit, but it&#39;s not connected to the vaccine.

I was laid down and vital signs were taken. My heart rate was in the 110s and 120s and stayed elevated for about four hours. The hives resolved and did not spread to the bilateral arm or anywhere else. The following two days I felt incredibly weak and had urinary frequency. I was told to go to the hospital by the health clinic staff but I declined.

                                                3/18: Chest pain. It woke me up in the middle of the night with some dizziness. At first, I disregarded it, then I tried falling asleep again, but I was jolted awake again with worse symptoms - vertigo, palpitations. I measured my HR, it was all over the place and irregular. Went to the ER, they didnt find anything substantial on my EKG other than arrhythmia with short PR. No treatment was given, instructed to follow up with PCP. Left ER between 4AM-5AM. Was able to go back to sleep, but the chest pain woke me up around 7 AM. The chest pain remained fairly constant with severity changing throughout the day. Symptoms were worse at night and more: inability to sleep, sometimes restlessness - the need to move, increased chest pain/tightness/burning, palpitations. Saw PCP on 3/19, she didnt have any of the lab results, but prescribed metoprolol - this medication was misunderstood as to when I was supposed to take it, therefore didnt start it until another visit that I had with my PCP on 3/22. Over the weekend, I took some ibuprofen to try to lessen the chest pain, it helped a little bit but not for long. Began taking metoprolol 3/22. I didnt sleep more than 2-3 hrs from 3/18-3/22

                                                Dizziness, Lightheaded, Chills, the first time I had to stop because couldn&#39;t drive, I had spasm&#39;s around the injection site, Generalized Numbing, the symptoms of the fisrt dose lasted one week. I don&#39;t like to take medicine and I had no choice but take Panadol every 4 hours and apply ice to treat the muscular pain. I went to emergency and was told that I had an urine infection  (which is very rare on me), and was treated with antibiotics.   With the second dose I took acetaminophen 500 mg befor the vaccine, that helped because the day of the shot I didn&#39;t have pain, but the numbness was like if I couldn&#39;t connect my body to the brain. Couldn&#39;t talk properly, sleep 2 hours during the day, is funny that I applied ice on the injection site (Me thinking) but the pain doesn&#39;t go away, when the ice melts I notice that I applied the ice on the wrong arm. That&#39;s what I mean when I talk about numbness. Fever of 39.8F and Chills even today . Some cough and dry throat (Dryness can be because I&#39;m a teacher) and constant tiredness.

                                                Everything started on January 24th at about 7pm exactly 20 days post first Pfizer vaccine. No other changes or vaccines given since October (flu vaccine) was scheduled for 1/25/21 for second Pfizer dose. It all started when I was working at ER when I started to feel cold like it was in an ice bath and numbness in both feet. I went to discharge my patients when I realized ascending numbness and coldness from the feet was traveling upward. Within 5 hours (around midnight) I went to hospital due to having severe weakness to where I couldn?t walk and loss of bladder control. I was rushed to MRI of brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. I also had blood work done and a lumbar puncture. I was admitted for a couple days to watching the ascending weakness and loss of feeling. My MRIs came back clear from any diseases such as transverse myelitis, MS, etc. My LP showed mild elevated protein at 54 (normal range 15-45), one tube elevated lymphocytes 100% (range 40-80%) and one tube elevated monocytes 50% (range 15-45%). Also CK-MB w/reflex was 352 (range 26-140). I was discharged on 2/26 at 5:30pm with a diagnosis of bilateral leg weakness and numbness. From this point on I was wheelchair bound at home and being cared for 24/7. After discharge some additional random symptoms started such as chills with no fever to where I slept in sweat pants and sweat shirts, leg spasms/ twitches, leg heaviness, severe lower back and hip pain, a loss of sensation while going pee or poo but not incontinent, and things like drop foot with the severe weakness and numbness . On 2/3/22 I started with double vision, blurry vision and pain behind my right eye. I went to ER and had repeat MRIs of brain, cervical, thoracic and lumbar with and without contrast and basic blood work and was sent home to follow up with Dr. on 2/9 and was discharged home. By 2/8 my strength started to get worse to where I couldn?t lift my kids. Finally saw Dr. neurology and MS specialist 2/9, he ran detailed neuro exams from head to toe, looked at both scans from both hospitals, all the blood work and LP results. He reported that I had severe hyper reflexes in both legs and Hoffman?s sign in both hands. My feet were completely numb and cold to where I couldn?t feel them or walk. Literally felt like everyday I was standing in a ice cold bath with no feeling of touch hot or cold sensation or pin pricks. He realized my loss of sensation was from my bra line down and included tingling in my hands and weakness in my arms. I was able to get up for the first time with a walker and take a few steps with assistance at this time. He then sent me to ER to be admitted and see their neuromuscular team to get further treatment. Upon arrival via wheelchair I was brought back to see the ER Doctor and re-did a neuro exam, some blood work and contacted the neurology team to come see me. I was then admitted to the hospital step down ICU under Dr with strict monitoring. On 2/10/21 The neuro team ordered another set of MRI of brain, cervical and thoracic with and without contrast due to a change in condition again since my last visit to hospital. They reviewed and compared studies with no changes. They scheduled me for MRI lumbar on 2/11/21 with and without contrast which came back no changes from previous MRI as well as another LP which everything that was off before was now normal. Everyday I would work with PT, OT and speech. I had no changes in speech and slowly got some strength back, and was able walk using a walker. I was then discharged home on 2/13 mid afternoon and was told I would do home health and follow up with their neurologist and Neuromusclar team once everything was resulted back. On 2/19/21 I saw my primary doctors office (nurse practitioner) where she checked up on the status of me, took me officially off work and on state disability, filled out paperwork for work and a handicapped pass. On 2/25/21 followed up with neurology, and discussed all my imaging and blood work. All CSF fluid came back normal, all labs were fine and wanted me to get an EMG to look for nerve damage. She also wanted a follow up with cardiology as my resting heart rate was 110-120 and would spike to 160s. On 3/1/21 Home health was started for physical therapy for strengthening and working on sensation for both legs. At this point I had almost full strength in my arms, still tingling in my hands and constant numbness and cold feeling in both feet and knees with severe sensitivity to cold, wind or touch on my legs. I had Home health twice a week every week for 2-3 weeks then started outpatient physical therapy which has been twice a week for 1.5 hours. On 3/5 I saw cardiology and was placed on a holt monitor for 48 hour monitoring. On 3/9 I had my EMG with Dr. and had a follow up with Dr. for 35 tubes of blood he had drawn for multiple diseases which both blood work and EMG came back negative. On 3/16 symptoms started to change from numbness to severe hypersensitivity to touch, severe shooting nerve pains, burning sensations, non stop tingling in hands, issues with temperatures either hot or cold, and swelling of both legs. On 3/17 I saw rheumatology that looked into everything said it was not lupus related as none of my inflammatory markers or lupus DNA strands were elevated and no lupus symptoms like rashes, ulcers in the mouth or tongue, hair loss or joint pain. He ordered more blood work and confirmed it was not a lupus flare up. He suggested doing a small nerve fiber biopsies. On 3/19/21 saw spinal orthopedics who reassured it has nothing to do with my spine, prescribed gabapentin for all the nerve pain and told me that neurology is who should be following me. On 3/26 I had an echocardiogram done due to the leg swelling and heart rates which came back negative for any heart problems and was told since the tachycardia is getting better to just continue watching it and was prescribed trazodone 25mg to help with sleep due to severe nerve pains, spasms and severe back and hip pains at night. On 4/1/21 was followed up again with neurology. Ordered small nerve fiber biopsy for may 18th, increased the gabapentin to 300 mg- 3 times a day and had me wean off cymbalta. I am still dealing with tingling, burning hot and cold sensitivities in both legs, still tingling in hands all day but strength is back to full. I am scheduled to hopefully return to work 5/30/2021 after being off since 1/24/2021.

                                                Sudden onset cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing. A fever of 100.6 was noted but unsure as to when that occurred as I did not have chills. Feber has subsided.  Cough, shortness of breath and intermittent wheezing remain as well as some chest pressure, sore throat, headache and chills. Coughing fits are bad enough to cause urinary incontinence but I did give birth 4 months ago so this may not be significant. No signs of allergic reactive such as redness, urticaria or swelling.

                                                hives all over body; UTI; huge cold sore on nose; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other HCP (patient). A non-pregnant 31-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration at Left Arm on 26Jan2021 17:30 (at age of 31 years old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.

No COVID prior vaccination. Nasal Swab on 09Mar2021 was Negative. On 26Jan2021 09:00 PM, within 5 hours of getting my second vaccination, patient broke out in hives all over body. Patient called doctor and was prescribed steroids to help with the hives as antihistamines were not helping. A few days later patient woke up with a huge cold sore on nose which patient never had before. The same day patient was experiencing symptoms of a UTI and was prescribed Macrobid which had taken several times before. Within an hour of taking it patient&#39;s body was covered in hives and throat started to close. Patient immediately went to urgent care where received a shot of Benadryl.

I was sent to the ER for a CBC but was sent home.  My Dermatatologist performed 2 Punch Biosypies.  I began having joint pains in my legs and stomach pains.  The peticia begin going and coming.  And the test results for the Punch Biopsies revealed I had HSP &#34;Henoch Schonline&#34;.  I began having GI issues with bloody stool, blood in my urine which prompted I be started on a high dose Steroid of Prednisone. On 3/24 I saw a Nephrologist who advised there was still blood in my urine and a  kidney biopsy may have to be perfomed if the steroids does not improve or resolve the issue.  Ive been having nose bleeding also but is unsure if its associated as well and I am scheduled to see and ENT for on 4/2 for that.

                                                On Saturday, January 23, 2021 I woke up around 5:30 in the morning with itchy hands and feet, after my second dose/ Just as I did with my first dose- Which subsided with Benadryl. However the second dose was given Thursday, January 21. The progressing of the itchy hands and feet lead to my bottom lip swelling excessively large , my tongue begin to swell, my upper lip begin to swell, my lungs begin to burn in my airway begin to tighten. I took two Benadryl and called my family to call 911 and take me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was very low pulse was very high. I had genital pain and swelling, dizziness , nausea vomiting, and extreme body pain. I was given epinephrine, breathing treatments, steroids, Benadryl, and IV fluids. Labs were drawn and my creatinine was high. After about four hours the swelling has gone down and I was able to go home. I have to take steroids for three days, Benadryl for seven , and famotidine.  I have no history of severe allergies, in fact I was tested for food and environmental allergies about a year ago and everything came back negative. I have no history of reacting to any vaccine at any time.

                                                This is a 37 y.o. woman who developed an episode of acute self-limited hemolysis just over a week following her second injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine immediately prior to the episode for a urinary tract infection.  She had no history of hemolysis prior to this episode.  She was in her usual state of health and received COVID-19 vaccines on 12/24 and 1/14 with the Pfizer vaccine and had no serious side effects at that time.  She then developed dysuria and was seen by telehleath by her primary care physician who prescribed ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine for her for 3 days ending 1/22.  She took these and her dysuria resolved, however the day after developed what appeared to be blood in her urine.  Then in the following 2 days which were a weekend this worsened and she started feeling poorly.  She also noted that she appeared yellow.  On Monday 1/25 her boyfriend took her to urgent care and she was subsequently sent to an ER at the hospital that referred her to our hospital.  There she was evaluated for gross hematuria with no evidence of urinary bleeding and found to be anemic due to hemolysis.  Her hemoglobin was in the 5&#39;s and she received 2 units of PRBCs.  She was transferred here to Medical Center for further management.  After the initial transfusion she did not require blood transfusion and her hemoglobin continued to increase until it was 10.4 on 2/1 which was the day of discharge.  At a follow up appointment on 2/8/2021 she was recovering and feeling well.   Her jaundice had resolved.   No treatment was given from the hemolysis aside from the blood transfusion and it was self-limited.  It is most likely that her acute hemolysis was due to the phenazopyridine as this agent is known to cause hemolysis and she took it for 3 days prior to the onset of hemolysis.  She has no prior history of drug induced hemolysis and had not taken this medication previously.  As this occurred just over a week following her second vaccination I cannot exclude that is could be related to the vaccine.

We were at a drive through clinic waiting the 15 minutes in the parking lot before leaving and had the paramedic from the ambulance come look. I leaned into the seat to let my husband photograph my dots, and where my shoulder was leaning into the seat, I immediately had a smattering of red pin prick dots. They began showing on my left arm. We were advised to go to the ER. My hemoglobin was fine (though clotting factors were off), and he?d see a few reactions like that, so we were sent home.   I had diarrhea, abdominal pain, and severe nausea, but nothing scary or bad.   I woke to not being able to urinate, and that was followed with complete incontinence. I cannot control my bladder at all, cannot urinate on demand, and often don?t realize I?m urinating until I feel the warm gush.

                                                Evening of 1-17-21 felt like I was having horrible vaginal infection symptoms. Saw a primary care physician on 1-18-21 and was found to have a raging yeast infection, bacterial vaginitis and urinary tract infection. I haven&#39;t had any of these in 15&#43; years. I was started on antibiotics. Next morning (1-19-21) felt extreme lower abdominal fullness and pressure and extreme nausea. I got in with my OBGYN at 9am same day and he discovered I had an ovarian cyst. He sent me down for an ultrasound and the results showed I had a ruptured ovarian cyst on my left side and an ovarian cyst on my right side. I have never had an ovarian cyst in my life. The next day (1-20-21) the right cyst ruptured. Having all three infections and two ovarian cysts (when I&#39;ve never had one before) lead my OBGYN and I to feel it warranted filing a VARES report

                                                I received my vaccine at 8:40 am on 1/6/20. By that evening I noticed I was having decreased urine output. Starting Thursday morning I had very minimal urine output for18 hours. I also had flank pain. During this time I also had a fever, body aches, etc. I am an ED nurse and knew to hydrate myself. I hydrated all day and evening. Thursday night I had no urine output for 6&#43; hours. Starting Friday morning I had minimal urine output and it was brown tinged. As the day progressed my output increased slowly and changed from brown to pink/orange. I continued to hydrate drastically. Saturday morning my urine was pale yellow and clear and my pain was gone. I believe I had an acute kidney injury.  Fortunately I knew to drastically hydrate and maintain that.

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

A 39-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 20Apr2021 at 19:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and pregabalin (LYRICA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at 100 mg, 3x/day for neuropathy. Medical history included neuropathy from 2020 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient got the vaccine and she was taking pregabalin as well and after vaccination, she experienced an adverse event, her legs were heavy and numb and also her bladder was now the problem she was actually now at the emergency room. Patient was a little nervous. The patient was still in the hospital and she was not getting any care. What happened at the beginning was that she totally became paralyzed from the waist down, when your foot fall asleep you get painful tingling feeling she have that kind of feeling in her legs not able to move any part of her anywhere from her waist down later on that night, after she took pregabalin, went to sleep about an hour she was able to move her left toes and able to drag one leg a little bit. She was supposed to take pregabalin 3 times a day and they were giving her a difficult time about it, she took one at 12 O&#39; clock on Wednesday and the hospital they did not give another one until 11 o clock that evening because she was supposed to take 3 times a day. After she no longer feel from the waist down, she took a pregabalin and it didn&#39;t help her it didn&#39;t work and her physician told her to take 3 times a day and then at 10 O&#39; clock yesterday morning she was still asking the hospital to give her another one. When asked to repeat the concern, patient stated &#34;weakness in her legs that felt very heavy like she was dragging. The date of hospitalization was reported as 21Apr2021.

The patient underwent lab test in the hospital. The action taken with pregabalin in response to the events was unknown. Outcome of the events was unknown.
