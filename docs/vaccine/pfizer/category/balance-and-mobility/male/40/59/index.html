A 40-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the arm on 07Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included clonazepam. The patient had historical vaccine first dose of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced tiredness. On unspecified date, the consumer stated, &#34;I just want to, I didn&#39;t have, I was just little tired with the first shot I received. But I am little concerning on the second one like I woke up at the middle of the night, I got it yesterday at about 13:00. I woke up at about 2:00 in the morning on 08Jan2021 nd I couldn&#39;t even really move but then I was up for most of the night. My temperature is like  between 102.6 and 103.5 and my back hurts really bad. So, I am hoping that these are normal things but I am curious at any point is there something I should watch out for taking on that stuff further. The first shot was not anywhere near to bad which I know is to be expected but the second one being the worse, it&#39;s like dramatic, I have had a fever for I don&#39;t know like eighteen hours. Is there anything I should just make sure, or like this can be a normal side effect, correct?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

He stated that he never gets headaches and was on a pain scale of 7-8 at that time.  Vitals were taken. BP 135/86, pulse 91, temp 96.4. We dosed the patient with 1000mg of Tylenol at 3:05pm.  At 3:15, the patient stated that his headache had increased to a pain scale of 9.  He wasn&#39;t doing well so the staff laid him down.  At this point the staff felt it was a situation that needed more attention.  They took the patient to the ER where he was given saline and something for headache.  The also drew labs. Not sure what labs they drew.

A 40-year-old male patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 21Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), COVID-19 in 2020 (Jun2020 or Jul2020; tested positive for COVID-19 at that time and has 3 tests after that which were all negative) and since then lost weight (2020), and root canal. The patient had no issues with vaccines in the past. There were issues with the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, because he would be positive to TB, but this is because of his culture, he is from a specific country, and so they cannot take that vaccine. The patient clarified that he did not take the TB vaccine, what he meant was he is aware he can&#39;t take it. On 21Dec2020, the patient works in healthcare and had a patient that came in that tested positive for COVID-19 and so because of that, everyone including him that came in contact with the COVID-19 positive patient had to check and get tested. This happened the same day as his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the test (Dec2020) came out negative. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had not had any antibody test for COVID-19. The patient asked the doctor, but she never scheduled him for that, until after last month, she talked to him about it, but by that time he told her that he doesn&#39;t need it now - it&#39;s been almost a year. The patient had the first dose on 21Dec2020 and at that time he did experience symptoms the next day (22Dec2020). At that time after the first dose administration (21Dec2020), he could not lift his arm and it was bruised under the arm. The next day (22Dec2020), he had back pain, with his neck he could not turn it (neck pain), he could not be on his left side where he got the shot on left arm, it was like that for 3 days. Then on Thursday (24Dec2020), he had headache every time he bended his head down, he would be sleeping and would wake up in middle of night because of the headache, it felt like a sinus headache on one side of the head, and when he bend his head down, he would feel it, it stayed this way till 29Dec2020 (Tuesday). The patient has a question trying to find out with his employer. They told them they need to take the vaccine, they pushed them to take the vaccine, he works in healthcare. If they get sick at the job, he asked if they (employer) would pay for it, how would he get paid. The job told him he gets paid sick days and asked how they would do that. The patient asked how long the vaccine was alive in the body and how does it work. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

I have never had a reaction like this to any other shot/vaccines.

My heart began to race and I was lightheaded. I reported the reaction and was given an oximeter to check oxygen and heart rate. Heart rate was 140, oxygen 99. BP was also checked and was normal. Was given water and sat for another 10 minutes. Felt better and heart rate was under 100 until another wave of lightheadedness came over me and heart rate spiked again to over 120. It came down again. A few minutes later lightheadedness came back, shaking started, and heart rate spiked again. It lasted about 10 minutes. After 55 minutes of staying at facility I was able to leave. However, did have one more brief episode of lightheadedness and heart rate spiking. Sore arm and extreme ringing in one ear were only side effect the  following day.

Once he received the vaccine, he became nauseous, sweaty, clammy, dizzy and lightheaded. Pt explained to immunizer that he was switched to night shift and had taken his diabetic meds without food soon before his shift at 5:30pm. An EMT was on scene and she proceeded to call more medics. I checked on the pt and he was vomiting and very pale. Medics checked pt vitals and okayed him for work.

                                                Within few minutes, I started feeling high heart rate and dizzy. Notified health care professional and they took me in to observe vitals. Heart rate and blood pressure was higher than normal. EKG looked normal but with higher heart rate. Started feeling better in an hour and went home. The high heart rate recurred the next several days but would go away after few minutes.  Occasionally I get a headache and feel resting heart rate is higher than before. Definitely feeling better after two weeks compared to day of the shot.

Initial blood pressure was 75/50s, and subsequent monitoring show that his blood pressure was in the  136/85. No itching, rashes, shortness of breath, facial swelling, tongue swelling, or anaphylaxis.

I also had trouble with balance and fine motor skills.  Had some personality changes too: became very moody with erratic mood swings. The next day I slept all day because of exhaustion and aches. When I woke up on Wednesday (36hrs later) I was literally screaming in pain because of how bad my arm and shoulder hurt. It hurt to move it, and hurt not to move it.  It was excruciating and ibuprofen didn&#39;t seem to help at all. Throughout Wednesday I could hardly move my left arm. Getting dressed or washing my hair was very difficult and very painful.  I was also still very uncoordinated. My left armpits lymph nodes were so swollen that (1) it filled in my entire armpit so there was no more pit, just a very soft bulge, and (2) the fluid extended all the way to my chest and it looked like I had one breast and one pec.

Everyday so far feel off and on tired, dry mouth off and on, dehydrated?  Felt tired within an hour of injection on Tuesday.  I don&#39;t remember if my stomach was growling on the first night on the day I got injected and I just went to bed.  The next morning I woke up really thirsty/hungry and tired. I slowly made myself breakfast. Sat down to eat on a stool and felt dizzy. My heart raced for 30 sec as I carefully made my way to the flow to be safe. I had the chills, a bit shaky for a short period. I called my doc who told me to stay hydrated. The clinic where I got injected DID NOT inform me about dehydration. As of today, I still have off and on a dry mouth, feel more of an empty stomach at meal time, tired off and on, and maybe dehydrated. I work from home so I am not pushing myself. I have not felt dizzy again and am decent at taking in water now.

This was followed a couple of hours later by body aches, alternate hot and cold spells and headache. Injection site was sore, which started the previous day. Massive headaches from 4/9 to 4/11. NSAIDs somewhat helped symptoms. Began feeling human on 4/12. Was like a bad influenza, but no one else in household had any symptoms subsequently, so assume it was the vaccination.

Approx 10 minutes later I felt fine.  Don&#39;t know if it was a reaction to the vaccine or the fact that I don&#39;t like shots all that well, but I was told to report it.  This has happened before when I have gotten a shot but it doesn&#39;t always happen.  I would say its 50/50

After 10-15 minutes, he came to the pharmacy counter stating he felt hot and sweaty.  His eyes then rolled backwards and he collapsed on to the floor.  He was unresponsive, his head and back arched and he slightly rocked while on the ground.  I went to make sure he didn&#39;t hit his head and patient became responsive.  We tried to have pt stay on the ground, but he refused.  Therefore we moved him to a chair and elevated his legs.  911 and store medical assistance were called. After the ER services arrived and examined pt, left on his own and stated he felt fine now.

                                                I have a lot of knee and quadricep pain in my right leg, making it difficult to walk. The pain is slowly going down and range of motion of my leg is slowly improving as of today, Wednesday, May 5th, but on Sunday and Monday I could not walk, and I am still hobbling around as the pain feels like it will take a few more days to subside.

Then out of nowhere I heard him moan and saw he was foaming at the mouth and violently convulsing and turning blue. I did cpr and the paramedics arrived and took him to the hospital. We are following up with a neurologist tomorrow.

                                                Started 5/11 in the morning with headache and dizziness. Left arm started feeling heavy and numb also finger tips got tingling.  Started to get sharp chest pains near my heart then started to feel fatigue. Then my tongue started to get swollen/numb and I couldn&#39;t really talk. Went to urgent care and due to my condition they called the ambulance and went to hospital. They did an EKG/chest x-rays and blood work. Couple hours later they send me home with no diagnosis just to see primary doctor.  Symptoms were mild for 2 days then again on 5/14 symptoms came back and went back to urgent care. They did an EKG/Covid test/ only and doctor just said it was a panic attack. I disagree I still don&#39;t feel completely right.

                                                Patient experienced syncope after receiving 2nd Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He sat in the waiting area for approximately 2 minutes before coming back and knocking on the consult room door. When we opened the door he said he felt like he was going to pass out and then fell to the floor, hitting the left side of his head against the wall. He quickly regained consciousness after only a second or two and was able to scoot into the consultation room where we had him lie on his back and elevate his legs. We also gave him a cold compress for his head. We paged department and when AP arrived he contacted EMS to come check him over. The patient did not loose consciousness again and was able to hold a conversation with us while waiting. EMS arrived and checked his vitals and came to the conclusion that he did not need an ambulance. After EMS left the patient drank water and orange juice and sat in the consultation room with me for 20 more minutes before leaving. Patient has no previous history of vaccine reactions or history of fainting. He had no reactions to his first dose other than a sore arm.

                                                Walking to the observation room approximately 2 minutes post shot I felt extreme dizziness.  Felt like I could potentially pass out so I waited 30 minutes in the observation room before leaving.  After I was fairly confident I would not pass out I left the facility.  When I made it outside it felt like the right side of my brain was &#34;not there,&#34; like a portion of my brain was dead.  While driving home approximately 45 minutes post shot I felt numbness and  tingling on the right side of my face.  Mental confusion also started.  I don&#39;t recall the numbness and tingling in my face continuing at this time.  Proceeded home, laid down on the couch to relax and about 3 hours post shot felt my heart racing.  Checked heart rate with pulse oximeter and heart rate was 120 w/98 oxygen.  5 minutes later the heart rate went down to around 90 but blood oxygen went to 90.  I sat up, drank water and pulse/oxygen returned to normal.  The next day the mental confusion continued.  Approx. 24 hours post shot tingling and numbness felt on right side of face.  Couldn&#39;t move lips properly, communicate to my facial muscles.  This lasted around an hour or two.  30 hrs post shot short term memory loss caused confusion when typing texts, following conversation, etc.  Symptoms improved greatly over the next couple of days.  Tiredness/general unwell feeling approximately 48hrs post shot but unremarkable.  By the time I went to a GP 84hours post shot I felt 95%.  Went to a neurologist 108hrs post shot who performed standard tests and all was well.  1 week post shot got into an argument and felt tingling and numbness on right side which lasted approximately 10 seconds.

                                                From the patient  I participated in phase 3 randomized, Double-Blind, placebo controlled Center study for Clinical Research back in December of 2020 to determine the safety and efficacy of AstraZenecas, a combination of 2 of their monoclonal antibodies (AZD8895 and AZD1061) to preexposure prophylaxis in COVID-19 I was told to wait at 90 days before I got my vaccine and I think I should have waited much longer.  Not long after I received the monoclonal antibody treatment I started to have really bad depression issues and anger problems that seemed to last up to around mid April of 2021. I also had my hepatitis viral load go from 180,000 to 580,000 in just a few months so a massive jump in hep c viral load. I reported all of this to them and they assured me that I was fine and the promised I?d be ok.  I recently got the Pfizer vaccine with my second dose being on May the 7th 2021. My first dose on April the 16th was felt within minutes and I thought I was going to have to ask a staff worker with help getting out to the car.  I was very sick for a day or so and it made me very frightened to get the second one. So much that I contacted The  council about it. Everyone was extremely polite and very helpful.  I got my second dose and it was not as bad to go through but now I have a constant fungal infection that I can not get rid of and if I eat sweets it gets really bad.  My concern is not for anyone getting just the vaccine but for the people who have had the monoclonal antibodies and then getting the vaccine within 3 months.  The second dose seemed to make me angry but it did not last as long.  I?m worried about the effects other people may have had by combining the 2 or maybe not waiting longer before getting the actual vaccine. I don?t know but I can?t get rid of this fungus and I?m not sure else who to report it to. I?ve obviously shown it to my doctor. He gave me anti fungal creams but it turns out I have an allergy to fungal creams.  I did let the drug trial site know what happened as well.  I do not think it?s a Pfizer thing but a combination of it with the AstraZeneca monoclonal antibodies and the vaccine.

The pain kept getting worse and worse each day. I finally had to drive myself to the emergency room (5/4/201)  to get it checked out. It felt like something was squeezing my heart.  i was super light headed and felt like i was going to drop on the floor dead.  They gave me a chest x ray and took blood work.  Everything cam back good and the doctor said if i kept getting those chest pain i should return. so they let me go.  i still kept getting my chest pain for another week. however i didnt go back to the ER, because i was scared of getting a second bill as im not insured.

                                                2 days post vaccination onset of acute arthritic symptoms symmetrically along body beginning in the hips, and escalating to back, neck, shoulders, wrists, hands, and knees, in that order. Right side is now becoming more severe for pain and stiffness, but still roughly symmetrical. Symptoms are more severe upon waking and some mobility is restored by regular movement within an hour, but it is becoming harder and more painful each day. Was taking ex str. Tylenol at 500mg 8 x3 times a day for pain management, have since switched to aspirin 500mg 4-5 x2 times per day but that too is becoming less effective. Severe mobility impact, cannot get groceries, walk dog, open bags, jars, cans, and am starting to develop anxiety around the worsening symptoms. No health coverage. No primary care physician. Sporadicly I have days that the symptoms are almost completely non-existent, but these ?relief days? are never consecutive and the next day will always have the symptoms worsen again.  I have always generally been in pretty good health, and I?ve never taken anything regularly, but this has me terrified.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

                                                Patient received 2nd dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at 2:04pm , &lt;5 minutes after vaccine administration he developed hypotension with loss of consciousness for few seconds. He was sitting in a designated chair for the protocol 15 min observation and fell from the chair to the ground, hitting the right side of his temporal - redness noted around area with skin intact. Clinic staff immediately moved patient to be lying down on the ground with cervical spine precaution and lifted his legs up on a chair. Vitals: HR 78 and BP 118/72 taken in supine position on ground with legs elevated. Patient was transported by EMS to the ED at 2:45pm. ED note: Patient has Hx of vasovagal syncope in the past with similar symptoms after blood draws..Exam and workup shows well-appearing young man, nonfocal neuro exam, normal gait, cardiopulmonary exam unremarkable, no signs of trauma other than a small hematoma to the right forehead. After evaluation, their Canadian Syncope Risk Score is -3 indicating very low risk for 30 day serious adverse events (&lt;1%). Telemetry monitoring during their ED stay has not captured any events. Discussed next steps with patient: given their low risk for 30 day serious adverse events (including death, serious arrhythmia, MI, PE, ICH), they would prefer to be discharged to continue their workup as an outpatient, rather than admission for observation. Patient was deemed stable to discharged from the ED at 5:57pm with counseling to follow up with PCP in the next 2 days and to return to the ED with any persistent or worsening symptoms.

                                                Patient screened for first dose of Pfizer vaccine. He checked no history of allergies or reactions to medications or vaccines. In the initial screening he informed me he had a phobia of needles but this is usually with blood draws. He reported he should be fine with vaccinations. I inquired on previous reactions and he denied any allergic reaction just that he does not like them. I asked him how I can help give the vaccine. We had him look away and to think of a different situation. I asked him if he would like to know when I am administering or just use distraction. He chose to be informed when he would feel a slight poke. Vaccine was administered with no issues.  Within the minute following the vaccine patient started to feel dizzy. Hung his head a bit but was responsive. I requested staff assistance to help the situation including RN to prevent any episodes of syncope.  We provided water which he was able to drink. He was still seated and we suggested putting head between legs. This was not comfortable for him so we moved him to the floor. About 3-4 min in he began to sweat a bit more and appeared Pale. We obtained a BP and pulse. BP was 112/60 and pulse around 60.  When he felt hot, sweaty and appeared pale we all decided to call EMS to be cautious. He maintained BP, no SOB, did not lose conscious. EMS evaluated him, med list provided and vitals. He was on medications for anxiety.  They released him after about 30min and reported a panic attack and not related to the vaccine.  Patient walked out of the clinic with his partner and was stable. He is requesting 2nd dose of the vaccine. I informed him nurse would review and would have a plan for future injection.

MRI of head &amp; neck done to rule out stroke.   Meclizine 25mg &amp; ondansetron 4mg ODT prescribed.  Meclizine 25mg x 2-3 doses per day was needed for the next 7 days to perform daily activity.  Was able to resume walking slowly with medication on 2/1, but could not look at a computer screen to work without meclizine due to nystagmus until 2/6.  Symptoms did not improve enough to be cleared to drive until 2/9.  Full symptom resolution by 2/11.

I explained that chills are a common side effect after the vaccine. Pt felt well enough to sign out. We discussed options for worsening symptoms. Pt verbalized understanding importance of reporting worsening symptoms to PCP and me as well as going to the ED for life threatening symptoms. Pt came back at 4:30PM after signing out and asked to stay in observation. During this time, his symptoms worsened from chills to body aches and dizziness. Gait with assist was unsteady. I brought him down to the ED at 4:50.

By 4:15pm, I was experience acute lower back pain that made it difficult to stand up.  The pain continued for the rest of the evening.  By the morning of Saturday March 13th, the pain had subsided to a tolerable level.  By the morning of Sunday March 14th, the pain subsided even further.  It is now Wednesday March 17th and the pain is not gone although it is much reduced.  I attempted to get an appointment with my PCP to discuss the wisdom of getting (or not getting) the 2nd shot on April 2nd but so far I have been unsuccessful in getting an appointment due to scheduling limitations at the office.

                                                The patient is a 41 yo male with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis who experienced DVT and PE temporally related to Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine dose #2 receipt.  He is a Service Member and reported  high levels of baseline activity, including running 10 miles each Saturday. He received vaccine #1 25 JAN 21 (EN5318) without AE. He received dose #2 on 16 FEB 21, (EN6200). He experienced no immediate symptoms suggestive of IgE event. On day 1 he reports feeling cold, mild fatigue but no other symptoms. On day 2 he was baseline. On day 3 he noted numbness, tightness  and discomfort to his right  calf. On day 4 (Saturday), his usual long run day, he experienced dyspnea and lightheadedness after running 20-30 feet. He states he noted tightness in his calf and instead walked the track while his wife completed her run. He rested day 5.  Day 6 he noted significant edema to his calf, which he describes as double normal in size, and iced it. Day 7, he tried to schedule with PCP and based on triage was sent to ER. ER diagnosed R DVT and bilateral PE&#39;s. He was admitted overnight, started anticoagulation therapy. He saw hematology, and the workup was negative for other causes.

Since then there has been nausea and headache, and I have trouble sleeping in. I feel some more discomfort after eating food.  I have intermittent fever also. It has been about 10 days today since I got my COVID Pfizer shot  and I still don&#39;t feel physically well. I just wanted to report this, as the impression from documentation I read is that symptoms should go away in 3-4 days.

When I arrived at home an hour and a half later I was dizzy again and experienced rapid heart beats. Symptoms lasted for 30 minutes and then the symptoms stopped. While I didn?t experience any more side effects today, I did notice that the are around the injection site is significantly swollen and sore. I?m using an ice pack to help bring the swelling down.

We sat him down and grabbed our nurse practitioner. She monitored his pulse. He began to feel so faint that he asked to lay on the floor. We called 911. When paramedics arrived he was starting to feel much better. By the time it was over he left the store (was not transported to the hospital).

I visited a doctor and he told me I have vertigo (BPPV). The symptoms match vertigo, but I?ve never experienced it before in my life.  It seems like it?s possible that it is a result of the second shot. I?ve read online there are many other people getting similar symptoms.

                                                A few hours after my 2nd shot I got dizzy then a headache. My arm hurt too, quite a bit. The next morning I woke up with a fever of 101.5 and kept that fever for 2 more days. I felt weak, dizzy, but the physical pain was the worst. My head was pounding, my neck, back, and legs all hurt. That passed after a day except the headache. 3 days later I still have a low fever, headache, but mostly dizziness. I&#39;ve never been seriously ill in my life. Ive never been sick enough to get antibiotics prescribed. I eat healthy, don&#39;t drink or smoke. This vaccine floored me though. Like getting run over by a truck.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine (approximately 5 minutes after), patient said they were feeling light-headed. I went to go get patient water and a granola bar since he hadn&#39;t eaten breakfast and patient passed out. Patient was resting after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine, and was propped against the wall in the corner on a chair, so he was just leaned up against the wall (didn&#39;t fall to the ground). Several patients helped me move the patient to the ground so he was lying horizontal and he woke up almost immediately (max 10 seconds). He wasn&#39;t quite oriented to what had just happened but knew he was on the ground. Within 1 minute, patient knew where he was, was feeling fine and wanted to sit back on the chair. He was carrying on a full conversation and did not feel feverish, sweating, tired, faint, or have a headache, just embarrassed. Patient stayed for a full 30 minutes and wanted to drive himself home because he felt completely back to normal. Vaccine administrator calling to check up on patient during next available break.

I started to feel dizzy and then I fell to the floor and passed out. The paramedics did an ekg and thought I was having a heart attack. They rushed me to the Emergency Room and they performed more tests. The tests showed their was nothing wrong with my heart previously.

The patient then fell to the floor from a seated position in a chair in the observation area. The EMT and Paramedic immediately responded to the patient. They assessed the patient and brought him into a wheelchair once he was feeling well enough to do so. The patient never lost consciousness. Initial vitals: BP 96/60, O2 95% on room air, RR 24, HR 64. The Paramedic took a 12-lead EKG, result was Sinus rhythm with apparent ST elevation. Subsequent EKG was sinus brady with apparent ST elevation. The patient was free of contusions or scrapes from his fall from the chair. PT initially refused transportation to the emergency department. After some convincing, the patient was agreeable to seek elevated medical treatment and was transported by ambulance.

                                                3/26 @ 3:15pm ? Got the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for the 1:10pm appointment. However actual time received was around 3:15pm. No vaccine reaction was observed and drove back home. However did not eat or drink much from morning till 4:30pm due to the long line at the vaccination center   4/4 @ 9:00pm ? Experienced first sign of near-syncope at the dinner table upon picking up a glass of milk  4/6 @ 8:45am ? Experienced brain fog, to be exact head felt like it was filled with cotton candy, at the back and top of the head. Felt this way the entire day. Went to work as usual. Logged out at around 5:30pm  4/7 @ 9:00am ? dizziness started getting worse. Started feeling imbalance and started losing depth perception which climbing down staircase  4/8 @ 10:00am ? started to get easily startled by any unexpected trigger. Whole body would ?twitch? or ?startle? upon slightest unexpected event. For e.g., sound, touch, taste (hot/cold)  4/10 @ 12:00pm ? Went to ER. ER ordered series of book tests, EKG, chest x-ray. Everything came out normal. ER doctor said to wait it out and after a week symptom may go away. ER doctor felt body?s immune response was over-working due to the vaccine immune response and possibly pollen allergy I may have experienced right after getting the vaccine. No prescription meds give. Advised to take Meclizine 25mg and Zyrtec. Below are the symptoms experienced on 4/10:  ? Lightheadedness/Sudden Jerking body movements when triggered/passing out momentarily for a second when taking strain/not in my elements ? Feeling extremely fatigued. Did not sleep well at night on 4/8 and 4/9 ? Head feels Intoxicated, foggy, lightheaded, as if stuffed with cotton candy. Startled when unexpected things happen like a sudden jerking movement along with momentary passing out while anything unexpected happens. E.g., when I am pushing myself on the sofa to re-position, I feel my whole body is turning off for a second. Simply does not feel normal ? Rubbery legs ? Worsens after shower. I feel like I need to lay down as the foggy feeling worsens after shower ? Lightheadedness. Losing control sometimes. ? I am easily startled when climbing down the stairs - no Depth perception. ? Don?t have the strength to blow nose or cough. Feels like momentary fainting when doing these activities ? Dis-equilibrium. Whole body is twitching when something unexpected happens to my senses. ? Unable to control while laughing feels like momentary faint. I have felt like this when I was down with a fever. Tickled easily ? Difficulty pulling myself out of bed. Felt like muscle was giving away ? Tingling feeling in the right abdomen area ? Difficulty staying alert or focused and random rather unpleasant thoughts constantly coming to mind. Felt a bit of panic attack.  4/11 ? Went to PCP. Body weakness and fatigue got worse. PCP did blood sugar test and flushed out the left ear. Ordered Brain MRI to see if structurally anything was wrong. Brain MRI came out OK as well however noticed minor sinusitis. Prescribed Amoxicillin antibiotics and nasal spray. Referred me to Neurologist and Head and Neck Specialist.  4/11 ? 4/15 - Above symptoms progressively got worse. Especially weakness in the arms and shoulders. Arms quivered every time trying to stand up and felt like fainting. Hand-eye coordination progressively got worse. For e.g., could not pick up water bottle, hands were quivering badly  4/15 ? Neurologist conducted certain diagnostic tests and concluded that there are no neurological issues. Said with rest and plenty of fluids it should get better. Spinal tap was not recommended and said if symptoms got worse a spinal tap can be done during the next visit. Follow up visit with neurologist scheduled on 4/27  4/15 ? 4/27 ? Weakness in arms got better. Arm strength and coordination has improved however it?s still not back to normal. Brain fog and dizziness still persists with no improvement. Left limb and arms are stronger than the left. Difficulty climbing up and down stairs. Dizziness worsens after shower. Not feeling myself. In addition, not able to multitask - getting startled and need to be deliberate about having to do everyday chores need to just focus on one task 100% completely and if something else comes up then my body just goes into a momentary shock. Mostly I can feel my head feeling heavy and my eyelids shutting down when something shocking happens ? a feeling like body is ?turning off?, almost a fainting or passing out feeling. Sometimes when I turn to one side and sleep, I can feel a flickering sensation in the ear. Still always feeling woozy and as if there is something in my head ? a medicated or intoxicated feeling in the head  4/27 ? Neurologist said she sees a lot of improvement and reiterated again that I don?t have any neurological issues. She said I can go back to work starting 5/1. She said I may have Conversion Disorder / Disequilibrium. It?s hard for me to fathom why she would diagnose me with Conversion Disorder when so many people are reporting very similar symptoms that I am facing on the below forum: https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/dizziness-among-common-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/  4/30 ? Next appointment with Head and Neck / Audiology

Started my work day from home with a meeting at 0900 and knew by 0920 that I had to take the day off.   Spent the entire rest of the day and night in bed. Fever peaked at 101.1F , nausea, constant headache, shaking chills and then sweats, extreme fatigue and full body severe muscle soreness. Light headed and very weak.  I slept all day until almost 1500. When I woke up my fever was gone. I&#39;m left tonight feeling hungry again along with some residual sore muscles and aches.  The fever responded well to Ibuprofen. I hydrated with water and Gatorade.  It pretty much felt like influenza for just under 48 hours. I feel like I&#39;m past the worst of it now, but I&#39;m not fully recovered.

Reading online, there are other people just like me who feel it right after waking up and theirs last weeks and some report a month and still have it. I am worried about not being able to do my job if it lasts days, forget weeks.

                                                On April 18 and 19, following my 2nd injection, I had very bad chills and could not get warm. I was nauseous although I did not vomit. On April 22, I began having severe sharp stabbing pains just to the right of my belly button. It felt like I was being stabbed with a very hot knife, and after about 15-90 seconds, it would go away. Anytime I reached for something, bent over, twisted, turned or tried to hug someone, I would get this same pain and it would double me over in pain.  On Monday April 26 at 7pm, I finally checked into the Emergency Room  at the direction of my Primary Doctor.  They did a bunch of blood work on me and sent me for a CT Scan of my abdomen.  All of the blood work came back in normal ranges, and the CT Scan showed my appendix was &#34;borderline&#34; according to the surgeon. They consulted with Dr and decided to admit me for a surgical consult and further examination.  They gave me fluids and morphine through an IV for the first 24 - 36 hrs, and then switched to Norco by mouth. I continued having pain throughout my stay.  On Thursday, April 29, they took me to surgery for &#34;exploratory surgery&#34; with the intention of removing my appendix and looking around to see if anything else stood out to them that would cause me this pain.  They stated my appendix had scar tissue on it and they removed it, but said they did not know if this would stop the pain I was having.  On Friday April 30, I was released from the hospital at approximately 6pm.  By 9pm on Friday, I began having those same sharp, stabbing, burning pains in my abdomen again, now to the right of my belly button again and further towards my right side.  I also had sharp burning pain in the inside of my upper right arm, between my bicep and tricep muscles.  This pain continued on through the weekend occurring more frequently and more severe.  On Monday morning at about 1:30am, I woke up with severe abdominal pains all over and went into the bathroom.  I had diarrhea and nausea and felt like I was going to vomit.  Between 1:30am and 7:30am, I went to the bathroom 6 times.  I went to work on Monday and continued having abdominal pains and diarrhea all day and night.  On Tuesday, I went to the bathroom a total of 17 times. On Wednesday, I saw my primary Dr.,  who examined my abdomen and pains.  He suggested I take immodium for the diarrhea and a supplement for muscle pain, as he felt this was the cause of my pain. On Wednesday, I went to the bathroom 21 times and was very nauseaus.  I started the Imodium and it had no effect on me whatsoever.  On Thursday, I had to call off work because I couldn&#39;t stop using the bathroom.  By 4pm, I had been to the bathroom 18 times.  I returned to the ER.  They took a stool sample and did an ultrasound in the ER.  They decided to admit me again for surgical consult and pain management.  On Friday, Dr ordered another ultrasound of my abdomen, specifically my gallbladder, kidney, and liver.  He also sent me for a CT Scan with contrast.  They completed a total lab workup of my blood.  All of these results came back normal, and nothing on the images showed anything wrong with my organs.   On Saturday May 8, Dr came to the hospital to examine me. He stated everything related to my GI was fine.  He asked if I have back pain, which I told him I do.  At this time, I was in extreme pain and I couldn&#39;t even touch my skin. Dr attempted to examine my abdomen, and just by placing his hand on my stomach, I screamed in pain.  He then put his hand behind my back and pushed a little, and it cause extreme pain in my abdomen.  At this time, Dr suggested that maybe the pain is caused by something going on in my back.  Maybe a pinched nerve or something.  He ordered an X-ray of my upper and lower spine.  Later that day, the results of the X-ray came back and showed there was nothing wrong with my spine.  With these results, Dr then ordered an MRI of my lumbar and thoracic spine.  On Sunday May 9 at 1030am, I was taken to radiology for an MRI.  The initial report shows that I do not have any pinched nerves and nothing notable that would cause this type of pain in my body.   As of now, no diagnosis or explanation for the pain I am experiencing. The pain is gradually getting worse and at times I am unable to move at all without extreme severe pain in my body.  At times, my right groin hurts and I am unable to stand on my feet, as it feels as if I have pulled a groin muscle.  The pain in my abdomen takes my breath away and feels like I am being set on fire in that area of my body.  The pain no longer goes away and is constant, but moves throughout my right side from my groin to my shoulder only.  I am not able to put my right arm behind my back because I get this pain in the back of my shoulder area.  This pain is only on my right side at this time.  So far, there is no explanation for this pain.  I never had anything like this until I got the vaccine.

I went to urgent care on May 19th, where the attending physician told me that it was likely that injection had been too high, which caused inflammation between the the joints of my shoulder. She prescribed an anti-inflammatory, and said it&#39;s likely I&#39;ll need physical therapy. I have an appointment with my PCP on June 1st to get an ultrasound done (at her suggestion) and then plan a course of action.

I felt like I had heart palpitations, then a tingling feeling in my left arm. After the second shot, I felt like my balance was off if I laid down or looked down and then pulled my head up. That went away after the first day.  Starting the following day, I had some chest pain over my heart, and at times, I would have a burning sensation in my heart. At times, I also felt a tingling down my left arm (sometimes out of nowhere). I would be very short of breath. These symptoms were on and off for the first two weeks after I took my shot. They have since completely gone away.

                                                About a week after receiving the 1st Pfizer Covid vaccine, I started experiencing heart palpitations and difficulty walking up stairs and/or hills.  I visited the ER the following day because I did not have a doctor nearby.    I was referred to a local doctor, who I visited May 6, 2021.  He dismissed the notion that anything was caused by the vaccine and put me on a low dose (5mg) blood pressure medicine and a 81mg aspirin.  Around 3-4 days after visiting the doctor, I started to feel normal again.  Since then I have felt 100% and back to healthy eating and exercise routine.  Nothing like this has happened to me before, and it was an abnormal situation.  I have not received any other vaccines in many years.

                                                About 1-week post second injection, patient developed Pulsatile Tinnitus in (R) side. This has continued for two (2) months after the second injection. Additionally, patient has complained of excruciating headaches on the right side of the head, behind the eyes and behind the ear. Patient has throbbing head pain, and becomes lightheaded easy. Blood pressure has increased to a perceived new normal of 140/90&#43; on most days, even at rest. Patient is normally very active, exercising at least six (6) days per week doing cardio and strength workouts, however has not been feeling well since the second shot. Patient is very fatigued by the end of the day, which is not normal. Patient wakes up in the morning to pounding headaches, pain level 5-7, every single morning with a perceived fast heart rate. Pulsating tinnitus is very loud for patient, and he cannot hear out of that ear, and difficult to understand speech or other sounds. No change in diet, working conditions or lifestyle other than receiving the COVID-19 vaccination.   Patient has been monitoring blood pressure at home with a machine and at the clinic. Average blood pressure is 143/90 with some readings as high as 160/95 and as low as 118/80 (after waking up on day 3 of a hospital stay). Patient was admitted to a hospital on 21JUN21 for abnormal ECG, high blood pressure and complaint of chest tightness, debilitating headache as well as pulsating tinnitus in head.

I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

A 42-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL8982 or E68982), intramuscular on 13Jan2021 16:00 at single dose in left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 42 years. Medical history included retinal blood clot in his retina which was why he was tested for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Meniere&#39;s disease for which he was asked to try meclizine which was for inner ear but he did not start taking meclizine, and six years ago, they did blood work and he was told he may have RA or he may have markers for RA but he has had no further issues and does not take any medication for this. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Historical vaccine included  influenza immunisation (flu shot) in Sep2020 and first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231) administered on 22Dec2020 around 15:15 at single dose intramuscular injection in left deltoid, and on 06Jan2021 he started to experience dizziness/feeling dizzy and going to throw up on 11Jan2021. He received the second dose of the Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021 and for the last days it seems that the dizziness is being incrementing, reported as worsened. His physician recommended him to perform laboratory tests and the results came back without abnormal findings except for cholesterol and vitamin D. He was told his cholesterol was a little elevated and his vitamin D was two points low, regarding his lab work. He got a vitamin D supplement which he started to take. He will start on his cholesterol medication today that was prescribed. Reportedly he has a Roomba and when he went to go press the button for it, he just about face planted. He looked online and could not find anything about the dizziness aside from dizziness could be a sign of a severe allergic reaction. He does not have hypotension or anything like that. Dizziness was not resolved, while outcome of other events was unknown. It was stated dizziness is not reported as a side effect of the vaccine.

                                                Ankle started tightening up Wed evening.  When I woke up on Thursday it was swollen and painful, unable to weightbear or dorsiflex due to pain.  Appears to be an acute tendonitis of right flexor hallucis longus tendon.  I was on crutches for a week before being able to wean off of crutches and return to walking normally.

Headache and wooziness were gone by next day but left facial heaviness, fullness, numbness and tingling persisted and is still present today.  Not as bad today but still under left eye, along left jaw and mouth, and parts of left cheek.   Had teledoc visit with doctor the evening of the shot and he diagnosed as Bell&#39;s Palsy.

On Wednesday, I noticed light bruising up and down my arms. Thursday morning around 10 AM, I started to have side effect - some so severe they must be documented. At 10 AM, I felt lightheaded and had brain fog. By noon my head was pounding with a headache followed by an upset stomach. At 2 PM things started getting bad and continued to worse. It was not the headache or stomach that need to be noted but a sudden and severe onset of depression and anxiety. - Depression like I have not felt in years when I was at my worst. Throughout the day the depression worsened and by 7 PM, I was unable to stop crying and was overwhelmed with anxiety and  PTSD panic attacks. While I have the training to understand  this is temporary, - I am very worried about what I?m feeling , because there was no warning or mention of this side effect. I have the resources needed for this but people that are more fragile need to prepare for the sudden o set of critical/ debilitating depression.

Pharmacy staff was alerted by customer that patient was &#34;not looking good&#34;. As we walked to patient, we slipped out of his chair and appeared to loose consciousness and/or have seizure-like symptoms. Patient looked very pale, perhaps had some minor foam at the mouth and was extremely hot. We stayed by patient, protected his head, allowed him to come to, took coat off and applied ice packs, took BP/pulse (normal) and patient was oriented x3. EMS arrived and took over.

When I went to see that patient, he was laying on the floor with his eyes rolled in the back of his head and was unresponsive. He was not alert. He started having a mild seizure and I rolled him over on his left side. While I was bracing the patient, pharmacist came in and administered an Epi-pen to his left thigh. Patient stopped seizing so I rolled him back on his back. He became alert and was able to provide me his name, DOB and what he was at the pharmacy for. I rested my hand under his head and monitored his pulse until the paramedics arrived

                                                Patient was given first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  I counseled the patient on side effects and asked him to wait 15 minutes afterwards in our waiting area.  After about 5 minutes, the patient starting complaining of feeling dizzy.  We asked him to sit back in the chair and brought him a bottle of water.  I asked the patient if he had eaten today and he replied no.  I offered a snack and also a glucose tablet to help with shakiness.  As I went to get a bottle of glucose tablets off the shelf, the patient fainted and fell out of his chair.  I immediately ran to get an Epipen while my technicians called for a Code White and 911.  I was about to inject the patient with the Epipen when he came to about 10 seconds later.  He said he was really hot, sweaty, dizzy, and nauseous.  Paramedics and AP arrived to evaluate him and take a statement.  Patient left on his own will and received a ride home from his mother-in-law, who is an associate at our store.

By 9:30 PM on the night of 4/3 the large right toe had swollen and was unable to move.  By the morning of 4/4/2021 no pressure could be placed on the right foot without extreme pain.  Pain reached highest pain by 4/7/2021 and has slowly tapered but remains.  Swelling has reduced to point where a lose shoe can be placed over foot and some walking can occur with effort.   Joint pain continues in shoulders, knees and hips.  I become winded after walking only a few hundred feet.  (typically jog 2 miles/day and walk an additional 5 miles)

                                                Experienced pain in lower back, lower spine area one day after shot #1.  That went away after about a week. After second dose (3 weeks after 1st one), I had no side effects until a few days after when I got the same lower back / spine aching and pain.  About a week and a half after second dose, the lower back pain moved to my left hip area and red spots appeared shortly after (a day or two after the hip pain).  The spots on my left hip and butt area started to burn and feel irritated...  I had mild aching in my pelvis area and lower back (spine) a few days after the shot and still today.  I went to the doctor 2 days ago and am currently being treated for shingles.  I am a runner, and ever since I got the 1st covid vaccine shot, my running performance has been worse... my pace per mile is about 20% worse (consistently) since the 1st shot.  I feel like it did something to my immune system and am still getting over it.

                                                Pt was found in severe distress in the bathroom by his wife.  He couldn&#39;t walk or stand, complained of being dizzy with slurred speech and was throwing up a lot. 911 was immediately called. The EMTs during their assessment said his BP was normal but when he was asked his name, he started saying the alphabet&#34;ABC... XYZ&#34;.  He was transported by ambulance to ER. Cat scan showed he had a bleed on the brain.  The doctors told us it was because he had very high blood pressure, however where the bleed was, they said he wouldn&#39;t need surgery and that the body would reabsorb it over time.  He was admitted to the ICU and has been there ever since.  Several days later, he started having difficulty breathing and they discovered several blood clots in his right leg that had broken off into his heart and lungs.  He had emergency surgery to remove the clots in his heart (approximately 10) and was given heparin in small doses over an 8 hour period so that it wouldn&#39;t cause the bleed in his brain to increase.  The doctor should fill in the rest.

                                                About six hours after receiving my shot, my arm became extremely sore, as to be expected.  Circa 9pm I began to have  significant trouble breathing, experienced acute pain in my abdomen, and began to hear ringing in my ears combined with feeling like I was going to pass out. I didn?t feel dizzy, rather I started getting tunnel vision that blocked out more of my field of view as the ringing increased.  Circa 11pm, I lost consciousness while trying to move and collapsed on the floor. My wife called 911 while I was unresponsive, and I regained consciousness while being attended to by EMTs who checked my vitals. Around 12am I didn?t feel like I was going to lose consciousness again, and the EMTs recommended I be taken to the hospital. Since I was feeling better I politely declined.   Today I am still feeling foggy and have joint pain (in addition to some bruising from falling after losing consciousness , but I no longer have the acute abdominal pain.

He sat in the chair for 5 minutes (according to the vaccinating pharmacist) and proceeded to leave. A couple minutes later, he was laying on the ground. I was informed that he just received a shot. I checked his pulse and he had a pulse. I elevated his legs and put an ice pack on his forehead. He proceeded to open his eyes after about 1 minute. He stated he felt dizzy and sat down. He then laid down because he was afraid he was going to fall. We called 911 and they provided care for him.

Suspect the stress of the fever, immune response, and then blood sample caused a stress event that triggered an abnormal heart rhythm.  Palpitations not accompanied by light headedness or shortness of breath, so no immediate medical care directed.  Episodes of palpitations continued for 4 days, but have mostly disappeared since.

                                                About 90 seconds after my technician gave the COVID19 second dose the patient felt dizzy and sat down in the lobby immediately. He began to drip sweat and his hands looked clammy. Patient said his hands were numb. He seemed to be breathing fine and when I asked if he felt tightness in his airway or chest he said no. I observed the patient and called down the street to urgent care to see if they could see him. I did no suspect an allergy so I did not use the epi pen, but I thought it could be an adverse reaction. The patient returned after urgent care and said since it was less then a minutes when it happened the provider thought it was actually a panic attack and not an adverse reaction, but I thought it deserved a report just in case.

                                                I had minor pain in left shoulder prior to the second injection. In the hours following the second injection, the pain became severe and ultimately debilitating. I missed several days of work and was prescribed muscle relaxers and Norco, I have never taken this type of medication in my life. I cannot sleep more than 4-5 hours total per night due to pain. I have also been prescribed 7 weeks of physical therapy which provides relief at the moment but does not last.

About 1 1/2 weeks after the dose, he started to get significant fatigue.  He started to sleep poorly.  He developed arthralgias described as bilateral, distal joints (hip down, wrists mainly).  He developed tingling sensations in his arms and legs.  He has had mental fog.  He had some HA and eye pain.  His PCP sent him to the ED for evaluation.  He was evaluated by neuro consult on 4/4, had an LP.  THe LP only showed some elevated protein (somewhat traumatic tap based on 10 RBC in tube 4).  MRI brain, cervical/thoracic spine was unremarkable.  He was dx w/ possible post-infectious polyneurophathy, and suggested f/u w/ neuro clinic for further eval.  Pt reports his paresthesias lasted 2 days and has since resolved.  He has not been seen by outpatient neuro clinic yet.  He did have a post LP HA which he returned to the ED for.  He reports that the HA has resolved.   In the past 2-3 days he has had felt less fatigue.  He still has arthralgias, continuous.  They do not seem to be worse in AM or PM.  He can do most activities and just tired working out this week.  Activity does not seem to make it better or worse.  The joints are not red or swollen but feel &#34;tight&#34;.  He has not noticed any fevers but gets occasional nightsweats or sometimes feels flush and measures only a low grade temp that does not last (&lt;100F).  He has had slight decrease in wt but no change in appetite.  No n/v/d.  NO cough, sob, CT/CP, wheezes. No rash. He does have some sinus sx&#39;s which he thinks could be c/w seasonal allergies.

Thursday, May 20, 2021:     ? ~ 05:00 - hard relapse.  Arm very sore (8/10).  Fairly nauseous.  Almost regurgitation level.  At the same time I do feel hunger so I know it&#39;s not real nausea, yet I still can&#39;t eat.  Bad headache (7/10).  Muscle stiffness up the back and up to the neck, getting worse the higher you go; the neck is particularly bad.     ?

High pulse (mine is usually around 50 bpm).  Sore muscles on entire torso; pain in my lower back (above pelvis) makes it too uncomfortable to sit up.  Except for not vomiting or coughing, it felt like the flu.     ? Head still hurts (4/10).  Weak.  Tired.  Arm still pretty sore (3/10).  Was able to eat kimchi chicken for lunch and shawarma for dinner, but still not completely over the nausea. ? Saturday, May 22, 2021:     ?

Felt ok on and off - but in the evening felt moderate vertigo multiple times.  Went to ER and physician judged either BPPV or vestibular neuritis or something similar. No prior vestibular history or tinnitus experience. It seemed to resolve after 2-3 days of meclizine. Then again on May 22, it started and continues where on adn off vertigo and dizziness persists. Meclizine is not very effective. Hoping I feel better soon. Have an appt with PCP on Friday. Feel some neck ache occasionally. and a bit of full ear

The head pressure sometimes is mostly on the left side and shifts to sinus pressure and left ear pressure. When the head pressure shifts to sinus and ear pressure, dizziness subsides. The head pressure almost everyday but there were a few days where the the pressure subsided. Took zyrtec for 4 weeks but had no effect. Took flonase for 1 week and had no effect. Sudafed sometimes helps relieve pressure for a few minutes but it persists soon after.

He was also feeling hot and complained of feeling a tingling sensation in his fingers. This was a few minutes after the vaccine was given and he was sitting at the post-immunization area. We directed him to sit on the floor and gave him 2 cold packs to put on his neck. Patient looked pale and weak so we also gave him some cold water. After a few minutes of sitting, he asked for us to call 911. We called 911 and alerted management. After paramedics came, patient was taken away. Patient seemed to be doing fine as he was leaving. He regained color in his lips, but was still feeling the other symptoms.

                                                I was giving my second dose of the Pfizer at the drug store, the shot was administered and a little dribbled out so the pharmacist gave me a double dose.  I don&#39;t believe this was necessary and could have been avoided if the pharmacist would have followed better protocol administering the due to the poor quality of the administration of the shot I missed three days of work. My arm was unusable for 3 days.. I had some mucus buildup in my lungs.. but luckily after 5 days of good rest I&#39;m okay.

They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

                                                The day after receiving the second vaccination, I began to have mild intermittent abdominal pain2-3/10.  The pain gradually increased, became more intense, and more constant.  Mild fever and chills started happening, and I took Ibuprofen.  By about 4 days after the vaccine, the abdominal pain was severe enough that I had some difficulty walking and I couldn?t sleep at night.  Pain was 6-8/10.  I went to the ER, and CT scan with IV contrast showed 18 mm appendicitis.  I underwent laparoscopic surgery and it was found to be perforated.  It was removed.  I am currently recovering in the hospital.  I received the vaccine as a health care provider at my hospital, specifically I am a practicing pediatrician physician for over 10 years.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

A 43-year-old male patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm left from 11Jan2021 to 11Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient states about 24 hours later he felt foggy, disoriented, and dizzy (all three occurred on 12Jan2021), states he then woke up at 3 am this morning and had a lot of numbness on right side of face and arm and had a hard time swallowing (both occurred on 13Jan2021), states a couple hours later he went to hospital, went to ER and had to do an MRI, states the MRI of brain and neck came back clear and checked out, states doctors concluded it was an adverse reaction to vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                I had some sort of reaction.  I was glad to get the shot and was not nervous about getting the shot. 5 minutes after the shot I felt something cold go down my left arm from my shoulder to my hand.  A minute or two after that both my hands went numb, then both my arms went numb.  I asked others around me if anyone felt anything and everyone else was fine.  A minute or two after that both my legs went numb. I started to black out but made it to a chair before this happened,  I drank some cold water and felt awake about 5 minutes later.  30 minutes after that i felt comfortable enough to walk.  For the rest of the day i felt like i was legally drunk and felt lots of pins and needles on the back of my hands and feet. I did not feel dizzy or nauseous at that time. i also felt a lot of pressure on the inside of my skin all over my body. I&#39;ve never felt anything like that and it was a bit uncomfortable.  The next day i was too dizzy to walk without becoming very nauseous.  I still had pins and needles on my feet. i had chills as well which i guess is a good sign.  my appetite was fine. i felt clear-headed as well.  Two days after the shot i felt slightly dizzy and by the third day i felt fine except for minor muscle cramps all over my body.  For the three days after the shot i also had some pretty strong forearm and calf muscle cramps and my arms (biceps and triceps) felt pumped up like i just had a great arm workout, but they weren&#39;t swollen at all.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

After receiving the shot, had him sit in a chair next to the table for a few minutes to see if would occur again.  After about 2 minutes, pt began reporting that he felt that he was about to faint again.  He began to dry heave and passed out momentarily for 2 seconds before coming back to.  Pharmacist caught him before he fell.  Gave pt water and took blood pressure.  Patient began to feel better.  Sat for 30 minutes and then he felt fine to leave.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

Within an hour subsided enough for me to return to work, and dizziness subsided over the next several days.  Similar reaction to booster dose on 2/16/21; less acute but dizziness continues 1 month later.  Severity is not debilitating at this time.

                                                Severe spinning, nausea, vomiting, occurred at 2:15 a.m. while on duty, was transported to ER and diagnosed with Peripheral Vertigo. Follow ups with ENT, Neuro and PCP have continued with Vestibular Rehabilitation. While in ER, the MRI, MRA, CT, CT with Contrast was done, showed no signs of anything that could have caused this. Ironically tracking back, I received my 2nd Dose of the Pfyzer Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. and this occurred on February 13th at 2:15 a.m. I have not had any other issues before this nor any signs of damage to the nerve or ear that regularly affects Vertigo Patients per my Neuro and ENT. The incident took place 4 weeks and 2 days after the 2nd vaccine. 2 days after the 2nd dose, I experienced Low grade fever, chills, and body aches that lasted only 12 hours, but nothing with the 1st vaccine nor anything after the 2nd dose issue until the Vertigo.  I am unable to drive, conduct my job, which requires me to go to emergency calls and carry a Taser (CEW). I have been off work since this occurred and still not eligible to go back to work.

I was thinking  that could be due to dehydration . On   03/ 14 /21 morning , I got severe left leg pain and could not able to walk. I took pain killers and did not subside and that end up going to hospital emergency . I was diagnosed with 2 blood clots in left leg  . I do not have family history of clots nor any h/o major medical issues . All my previous and recent blood reports normal . I am currently in use of blood thinners

No chest pain, no fevers, chills, cough. He saw his PCP for these symptoms who ordered EKG and CXR 1 day PTA which per patient were normal--plan was for referral to cardiologist. However on the morning on presentation around 6:45 AM after taking an elevator for work he began feeling lightheaded and lost consciousness, awakening on the floor. He went home as he was not feeling well however proceeded to have another 2-3 episodes of loss of consciousness at home witnessed by his girlfriend--the later 2 occurred while lying down and were not clearly associated with any presyncopal symptoms.

                                                On March 24 I got the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and I experienced side effects almost immediately. By the time I got to the resting/observation area I felt that the site of the injection got really warm and I became dizzy/lightheaded and started to feel heavy on the chest and little problem in swallowing and breathing. I was taken to the paramedics on site, they checked my blood pressure (which a little high 150/90), oxygenation, pulse, and EKG (which were normal). It did not became too bad after and was allowed to come back home.  However, the heavy chest and swallowing problem lasted for three days. The heaviness in the chested turned into a sensation of feeling like my trachea or the anything under the sternum area was behind strangled. Although I felt like this my breathing and swallowing was almost normal. Every now and then when I swallowed I felt some pain but I could withstand it.

Struggled to get up and down a set of stairs and had to go one at a time including holding the handrail (~43 year old male in very good shape, lifts heavy weights and runs 2-3 miles 3-4 times per week)  .  Managed to fall back asleep and woke up ~2.5 hours later with the same symptoms ,  plus higher fever (102 F) and additionally mild nausea and a very bad headache.    Took Tylenol and upon another 2-3 hour sleep had the fever more managed but dealt with the nausea, headache and aches/pains for the next 24 hours after that.   Symptoms resolved after about 36-48 hours , although I did not feel 100% back to normal until about 72-96 hours after this 2nd dose.

Any movement of my left arm resulted in strong stabbing pain in my shoulder.  After three days it improved and after one week it was completely gone.  The AE reminded me of calcific tendonitis flare up which I have in both shoulders.  I went to urgent care as I could not sleep due to pain and they told me to wait a few days and take OTC pain meds.

                                                Patient while sitting in the post-vaccination area for 15 minutes, started experiencing lightheaded and faint when he got up. I instructed the patient to sit back down and he complied. I went to grab the patient water and calm him because he seemed a little anxious and then he started shaking, so we immediately called 911. I tapped him to see if he was okay, and he said yes was okay but really faint and the patient was sweating. I asked if he was having trouble breathing, but he denied. He drank the water and had chocolate and I kept conversing with him to assess for any physical/mental status changes, and during the conversation the patient said he usually feels faint and anxious when he gets blood drawn but did not mention it during the screening because he never has when receiving vaccinations. The patient was appearing to improve, less anxiousness, less sweating, and getting more color back to his face. When the EMS arrived within 5-10 mins, they assessed his vitals which were all normal and the patient requested not to be taken to the hospital. The EMT personnel felt the patient was doing okay and left. I had the patient stay for another 30 minutes to make sure he was remaining okay before he left.

                                                The next day after the second shot, my right foot got acute pain. I had some  fatigue  on my left foot on the day I took vaccine and I had got it examined by the doctor, He did. To find any issue on my left foot and suggested it might be a regular sprain. He also examined throughly the right foot and it was perfectly fine in the day time of vaccinations. The pain on right foot joints got so acute that I could not move out of my bed. I waited for two days hoping that the vaccine effect will go in couple of days.but it became unbearable. I saw my pcp and the blood work showed erratic inflammatory markers and unusable high glucose very low platelets and I was given steroid for six days. The inflammation was coming down when I was on med and bed rest, last Saturday my right heel started showing a new and sharp throbbing pain. I went the ortho and they found that possibly my burssaties sack is inflameated. The pain is so unbearable that I am, prescribed some opioid based pain killers, the PCP and hematologists had a discussion , I was told that I may be developing auto immune disorder. I never had a history of ITP.  I am still hopi g it is a shock and body will calm down soon but I am on so much in pain and in a small place to get an immediate medical attention is so hard.

                                                Had minimum side effects during my first shot on 2/9/21 (lot # EL-9261).  About 3 hours after my second shot on 3/2/21, the room was spinning wildly to the point I could not look at the ceiling, I may have started to have &#34;brain fog&#34; that night as well.  3/3/21 I had chills, no fever.  3/4/21 while talking to a coworker I experienced a &#34;neurological event&#34;, I felt like I received a flash software upgrade to my brain, and things &#34;paused&#34; for a short amount of time.  Later on 3/4/21 brain fog was significantly impacting me and it was hard to complete sentences and communicate effectively.  From 3/2/21 to 3/ 3/7/21 I experienced brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, and chills (no fever).  I was fine on 3/8/21.  All 4 side effects came back on 3/24/21.  I was having chills, no fever, early in the day then led a meeting in the early afternoon and could barely finish my briefing.  I was having issues with fatigue, some dizziness, and brain fog.  From 3/24/21 to 4/19/21 the side effects that mainly bothered me was dizziness/vertigo and some brain fog.  Majority of time throughout this period the side effects were sporadic.  I was able to function at 100% then wham, I was out of commission for 2-3 hours, then back to normal again for a multi-hour window.   Hydrochlorothiazide worked well.  I also took Meclizine with limited impacts.  Also took a prednisone pack that took the edge off.

                                                Patient vaccine was administered approximately 1:50pm 4/27/21 and patient was asked to wait around for 15 minutes post vaccination. At approximately 1pm the patient&#39;s wife indicated he was not doing well.  I went out into the waiting area to assess the patient and determined he was sweating and feeling light headed as though he may faint. After a few moments I had my technician call 911 to send an ambulance. While waiting for the ambulance the patient requested some orange juice and I did provide that. He did drink some of the juice. Patient never did faint or pass out and was conscious the entire time until EMS arrived and as they took him away to the hospital. Patient appeared to be feeling a bit better as time went on.

It was the next day, more than 24 hours after the injection that symptoms became more intense. At that point I developed a bad headache with moderate nausea, as well as significant fatigue, and a little bit of runny nose. Now it is over 40 hours since the injection and my headache is not as bad, but I still do have a headache and mild fatigue.

                                                fainted; fell to the floor; hit his head; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 43-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), intramuscularly, administered in the left arm on 30Apr2021 at 12:15 PM (Batch/Lot Number: EW0172) as the 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination facility type was reported as the pharmacy/drug store; the vaccine was not administered at the military facility. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on an unspecified date. Relevant medical history included past experience with fainting on an unknown date. The patient had no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had vaccination on 30Apr2021 and then proceeded to the front of the store to check-out. On 30Apr2021 at 12:20 PM, he fainted and fell to the floor and hit his head. The 911 was called immediately. The reporter checked the blood pressure and gave patient some water. The paramedics arrived and took over. The patient refused paramedic transport to hospital. The patient&#39;s father picked him up from the store. It was unknown if the patient has ever had an adverse event following any previous vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included blood pressure with unknown results on 30Apr2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Faint cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had an extremely sore body and couldn?t lift my left arm over my head (I have some should problems anyway, but it made it worse). I had a slight headache, but it wasn?t too bad at that point (maybe about 9:30pm). By 12:30am I was feeling pretty crummy in a general sense and decided to go back to bed (I work nights and normally stay up, even on my nights off). I ended up with severe chills and shivering and shuddering by 1:30am. My legs were so restless and I was shuddering so hard I gave myself charlie horses. By 2:30am I started to warm up but because especially nauseated as I got warmer and warmer. I tried to sleep off and on, but ended up in a chair sitting up and dozing with a bucket in case of getting sick. I was panting heavily for some reason. It felt like it was making the nausea less severe (I also sipped on an Alka-Seltzer and took a meclizine). For three hours I was panting and trying not to vomit. Then I kind of settled down and got an hour or two of sleep, still extremely sore and by this time my head was pounding severely. I got up at 6:30am to take my Mirilax in orange juice (I forgot to mention I take a magnesium supplement and senna on a semiregular basis, as well). The combination of Mg, senna, and OJ didn?t sit well. By about 7:30am I began to get the chills again, but it only lasted about a half hour. Again, an episode of nausea after, but more Alka-Seltzer. I tried to eat small amounts of plain salty tortilla chips, but it didn?t help. It?s now 8:20am and the nausea seems to have passed.

I tried to go to shower but I could not walk and laid down.  My ears felt very tingly and I thought I was going to pass out but as far as I know, I did not.    I went to my primary care doctor and he has me taking baby aspirin daily (in case blood clot) and wanted to see if it got better I am going to follow up with a cardiologist.  I&#39;ve never had a problem with heart before and get an annual physical at work.

A 43-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0176), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 43-year-old administered in arm left on 18May2021 10:30 AM at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. Prior to vaccination, the patient wasn&#39;t diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ibuprofen received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EW0176), at the age of 43-year-old at the arm left on 27Apr2021 01:30 PM for COVID-19 immunisation.

A 19May2021 visit with his primary care doctor diagnosed a 4th nerve palsy of my left eye. This was confirmed by a 19May2021 visit to an ophthalmologist. It is now 21May2021 and nothing has improved and an MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) was pending. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in Pharmacy or Drug Store. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was not recovered.

Developed high fevers roughly 12 hours later with rigors.  Was seen in the emergency department.  Found to be febrile, significantly tachycardic (sinus) .  Was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone empirically.  Felt ill for the next 48 hours afterwards with weakness, slow to resolve tachycardia and cough.  Neck swelling subsided however, right neck lymphadenopathy persisted for well over a month.  Was sent home from ED with Bactrim and keflex for coverage of possible neck cellulitis.  However, I do not believe it was a cellulitis.  Neck was not tender, not indurated nor erythematous.  I am a hospitalist and had colleagues take a look as well.

The patient requested a chair to sit down and the Paramedic assisted the patient to do so. The patient expressed verbally to the Paramedic having a difficulty with needles and subsequently the patient lost consciousness while on the chair but maintaining a pulse and a hoarse respiration (snoring). Thereafter the patient was placed on a medical code in supine position with an immediate clearing of hoarse respiration. Evaluation by the Paramedic revealed an intact HEENT, (continued on page 2)...

                                                I felt light headed, dizzy and I almost passed out approximately 20-25 minutes after the injection. I then took 1 tablet of Claritin in order to counter the reaction. I sat down outdoors, removed my mask and jacket so I could breathe better. I also ate a sandwich since I thought maybe I felt dizzy because I didn&#39;t eat a full breakfast. I stayed outdoors sitting down for 2 hours before getting up. I felt better after about 1 to 1.5 hours. However, as of March 6, 2021, sometimes I have a drowsy feeling like I&#39;m on cold medication. However, I did not take any medication today. Also, for the 1st COVID vaccine I took on 11 Feb 2021, I took 1 tablet of Benadryl, which countered the allergic reaction which is why I did not have symptoms to report for the 1st dose.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

He requested water and as I was giving it to him he started to pass out.  He was conscious but slightly convulsing.  He appeared to have a minor seizure for approximately 5-10 seconds.  He was transferred to a wheelchair and sent into our recovery room.  As we were transporting him, he had two episodes of vomiting and continued to feel diaphoretic and weak.  He rested laying down but was not feeling better.  He could not tolerate any water or juice.

Difficulty maintaining balance (like walking while drunk only I don&#39;t drink anymore) NO nausea/spinning just balance.

Patient reported feeling lightheaded and dizzy and &#34;not right&#34; at approximately 10:00am.  Pharmacist took blood pressure reading (90/59 with pulse of 50) and initiated emergency response system (911).  Paramedics arrived at approximately 10:05am and assessed the patient.  After approximately 5 minutes under paramedic observation, the patient stated he was feeling better and the paramedics assessed the patient&#39;s blood pressure was normalizing.  After another 5 minutes, the paramedics left when they thought the patient was fine.  We kept the patient under observation for another 15 minutes and the patient, who was back to normal, left.

                                                This is sharing a concern / reporting a concern. This is not a complaint against anyone. This is not reporting side effect. The adverse effect date and time is a mandatory field. This is the reason I filled adverse date and time. I had my 2nd dose of vaccine on April 25, 2021 at campus at 1.20 PM. I just felt the syringe just touched the peripheral of my skin. I told the nurse that I do not feel I get the shot. Later, I do not feel any side effect any effect. I had no pain, or the site of injection was not swollen. I am worried I did not get the 0.3ml dose. During the first shot on April 4, 2021 at 1.43 PM, I felt pain on shoulders. I felt my tongue got thickened/ some tingling sensation on tongue and a little slur in speech. After 6 hours, I felt headache, a little chill, light head, nausea, more pain on shoulders and the next day, I felt light headedness and I felt tired for few days. I consider these as normal side effects and nothing unusual from what I read in internet and what I heard from others. So, I did not report it and it was a normal thing for me. Since I experienced this in first dose, I expected a more severe reaction than first dose. But I did not even feel pain at the site of injection nor any usual symptoms that usually appear. This made me to doubt I got required dose or the vaccine was correctly withdrawn from the vile. I do not know how to confirm that I got correct dosage. If I have not received the full dose, I am ready to take an additional shot and I would be flexible to take the shot at the available time near to my living place on any day.  Again, I am not complaining anything. Probably the nurse is very proficient in taking shot with no pain. I do not know why my body does not react to the second dose.

                                                I received the vaccine on Friday April 23. I was pretty certain that the pharmacist gave me the shot too high on my shoulder, because it was unusually high. Went home, shoulder was sore. But Sunday morning, I got up and my arm was in excruciating pain. I could barely lift my hand above my shoulder. That was last Sunday. 8 days have gone by, and the pain level is pretty much the same. I went to the emergency room for the pain last Monday. Then to my normal physician. I now have an appointment with an orthopedic doctor two weeks from now. But in the meantime, I am in a constant state of pain. Shoulder, neck, and high side of my back. Every morning, the pain is what wakes me up. I&#39;m taking way too many pain killers, and I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s damaging my stomach, but I hurt constantly so not sure what else to do. I never had any issues like this- until I received my second Pfizer vaccination from Pharmacy. I am pretty certain that the need hit a nerve in my rotator cup.

                                                Would occasionally have difficulty catching my breath while not doing anything.  I occasionally felt my heart flutter or it would possibly skip a beat.  Mild chest pain below above the sternum but I get that feeling from my Eosinophilic Esophagitis.  I&#39;ve become more concerned recently as I almost fainted once on 5/19 while working at my computer.  I&#39;ve had two other instances of feeling faint, most recently occurring on 5/27.  I historically have had no heart issues and can ski and hike all day and feel great so this recent change has been concerning.  After reading articles on the covid vaccines I realized that my symptoms are similar to the heart related issues and took ibuprofen when I felt additional chest pressure.  That has helped to alleviate the pressure at least.

                                                I was driving home from my town to another town. About 15 mins I thought I had to take leak and my groin area was warming up on the inside and then it started to burn up on the inside and it was painful I was thinking what could have caused and it then I realized I had the pfizer vaccine and then I have implant all of sudden I loss use of arms and it took about 20 mins for me to get use in them and then they started to burn up on the inside. Later on that night I started to cough really bad and my lungs had a hard time keeping me breathing and then I knew I had got the covid from the shot and it was much worst than the actual covid.  This was the first dose of the pfizer that I got these reactions and plus I heard about how the vaccine has been sterlizing  people from having kids. I knew that the pfizer vaccine is 100% unsafe for anybody to take and that it was a bad batch or wrong vaccine. But I am letting you know that you need to keep money set aside for damages from the vaccine. But please do not be like the other states giving people money, guns, trucks for getting the vaccine. I am warning people not to get it because I almost die in the first dose of the pfizer vaccine.

                                                1st shot Reactions- shot was at 3:30 in the afternoon of 5/7/21. No immediate reactions to note. Around midnight of that night though, sweating, hot &amp; cold, chills, Next day- nausea, diarrhea, and headaches. Could also feel soreness in my jaw. Intermittent lightheaded. Gradually started to notice swollen joints, achy bones. Popping/crackling of joints when moving/especially doing stairs. At a couple points, felt like I had frostbite while in the shower. Worst Joint pain of round 1 was May 27-31st.  6/1/21 Went to Dr. at hospital Reported symptoms. Was told that it could be from the vaccine but could be something else. Ran bloodwork. Liver levels came back elevated. 6/9/21 Still having joint p  See Continuation Page-   6/9/21 Still having joint pain. Also noticing frequent urination/urgency to pee. Bones feel fragile, like living with the skeleton of a 95 year old man. Dr. ran blood work and I asked him how he felt about me getting the second shot- Worried that if my issues were vaccine caused, that I might be pouring gas on a fire by getting the second shot? He said that it&#39;s possible but the chances were small. Told me to see how the blood work came back and proceed if all clear. Blood work came back and was normal.   Second shot  (6/11/21) Friday afternoon- shot at hospital at 3:30. No immediate reaction. Spoke with nurse at location and she had not heard of anyone having my symptoms. Only numbness.  Friday night around midnight, couldn&#39;t get comfortable. Skeletal pain grew unbearable in bed so I took a salt bath around 5am. Literally couldn&#39;t move my body/unable to get out of bathtub.  Stayed in there for about an hour and a half. Drank 3 bottles of coconut water. Couldn&#39;t make a fist. Pains shifted all throughout my body. Quick sharp pains. Had a slight cough and when i did cough, it blasted pressure from the inside of my skull, out. I&#39;ve never felt that before.  Slowly made progress and went to see a Reflexologist.  She helped but the issues continued throughout the day. No energy, couldn&#39;t move much without groaning. Couldn&#39;t get out of a chair on my own without pulling/pushing on something else. Had the chills but never a fever. Cold sweats.  Hydrated with electrolytes.  Got some sleep Saturday night and felt much better Sunday.

I lost my sense of smell 10 years ago due to sinusitis. I experienced lethargy about 5 days after the shot up to 4 weeks after. I had some tightness in my chest, my albuterol inhaler helped with that. The  tingling in my hand and feet happened on a few occasions. I had numbness that lasted about an hour. I had frequent night sweats that woke me. I had muscle tightness in my leg and abdomen. I also had soreness in my arm, which made it hard to grasp a pen. I did test my reflexes which were normal.

                                                weakness; sweat; feverish; dizziness; hot flashes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) or other non hcp. A 44-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EL8982 and expiry date: unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 21Jan2021 (age at vaccination: 44 years) at 12:24 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was not reported. There was no Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine and Adverse events following prior vaccinations was reported as none. The Pertinent Details (include surgical procedures and dates) was reported as not applicable. There was no Family Medical History Relevant to Adverse events. On 21Jan2021, The patient experienced dizziness after a couple minutes of receiving the injection, hot flashes, broke out into a sweat which lasted about 15 minutes after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and experienced weakness and felt that he had to roll down window, turn on AC, drink water and felt whole car spinning and experienced feverish. It did clear up before he left, however he felt dizzy on the drive home. He noticed that dizziness was on the list of potential severe allergic reactions. He states he has never had an allergic reaction to any other vaccines. He states that he has only been allergic to one antibiotic in the past (he did not name the medication) and he checked the list of ingredients prior to receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and it was not a listed ingredient. The patient was concerned about the potential for a more severe reaction after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine because he has heard that the second dose is &#34;more potent&#34; than the first dose and if he should receive the second dose of the vaccine considering the side effects he experienced immediately after receiving the first dose. The nurse walked by his vehicle to check to see how he was feeling and he was fine and didn&#39;t feel anything. After she walked away, he felt as though the whole car was spinning and he had hot flashes. He called the nurse back over and told her what was going on and that he felt dizzy and a little weak, really hot and he broke out in a sweat. He rolled down window, turned on AC and he was given water. Was monitored for some time at least 5-10 minutes before he felt a little better. Still had a little dizziness up until the end, but they continued to monitor him. He was felt better after that and was able to drive home. Because dizziness and weakness is listed as severe side effects, does this mean that they will last more than 10-15 minutes because he is concerned about getting the second dose. Knows and heard the second dose is a little more potent and if he had these reactions 2 minutes post injection should he be concerned about getting the second dose. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. Had a flu shot 2 months prior, but unable to provide NDC, Lot, or expiry for flu shot. No problems with vaccines in past. Again, mentions the only thing that concerned him was the dizziness and hot flashes he had 2 minutes post injection. No further details provided. The events has not resulted in emergency room or physician visit. The relevant lab test was reported as none. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever and treatment included over the counter Ibuprofen to help him feel better. Outcome of the event feverish was recovered and while all other events was recovering.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                Received  second dose of  Pfizer COVID vaccination on January 9, 2021. At the time of the vaccination he experienced discomfort of  left deltoid (site of injection) as well as paresthesia at the injection site. He also experienced systemic symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias for 24 to 36 hours. Over the course of the next several days he experienced continued significant numbness and weakness in left upper extremity, specifically in left deltoid muscle. By Sunday 1/17/2021 the significant left deltoid weakness and numbness persisted, specifically not being able to lift his arm greater than 45 degrees using his deltoid. He contacted health on 1/17/2021. On 1/19/2021 he had a consultation with a physician. Based upon his clinical examination, and symptom complex, physician does not believe that this is a cervical spine issue but rather a local nerve injury related to the injection site. He was prescribed a steroid taper. Unclear whether this is temporary or permanent issue.

Would sit up and move around and headache would dissipate with 30 minutes.  Am not able to lay on back or on side.  Received booster on 1/26/2021 and have had same  events.  OTC pain killers are not working.  Once I initially wake up I move to recliner and fall asleep.   We have a sleep number bed and have not had this issue in the past, although don&#39;t know if it is the vaccine or a unknown subtle change in day to day activities.

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 45-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL6269), via an unspecified route of administration in Left arm on 04Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 45-years-old) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. 51 hours after receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting down watching a film. His left arm began to tingle, and he felt a wave of dizziness and nausea come over him. He stood up, walked a few steps and sat back down. He broke out in a cold sweat, chills, and saw stars. He leaned forward with his head in his hands, and apparently fainted for a moment and lost control of his bladder. All events started on 06Feb2021 06:00 PM. No treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Feb2021. No covid prior vaccination, no Covid tested post vaccination, no known allergies.

He reported that after returning home he has dizziness and weakness that lasted 45 minutes and then resolved without treatment.  He did not seek care. On the day of his second shot (2/22/21) he said he had not taken his blood pressure medication that morning.  His blood pressure was143/98 and pulse 70 prior to vaccination.  At 10 minutes after the injection he reported feeling dizzy and having shortness of breath and feeling dry mouth.  His O2 sat was 98%.  Pulse had increased to 82 and then several minutes later was 110.   He was placed on a monitor but a large size cuff was not available at the vaccination site.  He continued to feel weak and more short of breath, so he was given a dose of epinephrine by autoinjector and EMS was called to transport him to the ER.  At the ER, he was given diphenhydramine and his condition continued to improve.   He was observed in the ER for 3 hours and discharged home.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

However, the atypical AEs included daily and persistent dizziness, &#34;brain fog&#34;, fatigue, difficulty going up the stairs without getting winded (difficulty with physical exertion).  These symptoms are still present on March 31st (11 days post injection).  GI / diarrhea symptoms are also present.  Of note, I did have COVID in the past (January 2021) - and had similar symptoms that had resolved at the time of the vaccine.  These symptoms are severe enough that it may prevent the second shot (due to concerns of worsening AEs or prolonged events).  Of note, the fatigue was worse with the actual disease vs. the vaccine.

                                                Injection was inserted very high in the shoulder. I think the injection may have gone into the bursa. The injection was quite painful. Significant pain within 2 to 3 hours post injection. I could barely move the arm for about 5 days due to overwhelming pain. There were no visual symptoms from this injury. It began resolving after about 5 days and has mostly resolved but I still have some discomfort in the shoulder joint after more than 3 weeks.

At the moment when the observer came to me, I was helping with the reconstitution of the vaccine. I literally had the vial in hand with syringe. I kindly asked her to get one of the RN&#39;s that were awaiting the arrival of pt&#39;s. She went to grab RN who then went to speak to the pt. Pt was taken to the bed we have set up here at the vaccination clinic. Pt laid  down on bed as I walked in to assist RN. I then elevated pt&#39;s legs and RN proceeded to take pt&#39;s vital signs. The ONLY symptom pt had was dizziness and a slight headache. No hives, breathing problems or swelling of the the throat. We applied a cold pack to the back of pt&#39;s neck. stayed and observed him for 15 minutes. He then stated he felt better besides the headache. No new symptoms at this point. vitals were re-taken and pt was allowed to sit up to see how he felt. Pt felt fine we then proceeded to have pt stand in which he also stated he felt fine .Pt was provided the post-vaccine handouts and verbally explained the signs and symptoms to him as well. Explained if anything severe were to happen, to call 911. Pt verbalized understanding and stated that he would. pt&#39;s wife and 2 sons were also here for a vaccine. Pts wife was instructed to drive home. No further action was required.   312pm- pt informed observer of dizziness 313pm-pt was sent to cot 315pm-BP: 158/92 HR: 69 RR: 16 O2: 98% 321pm-BP: 120/78 HR: 78 RR:20 O2: 98% T: 97F Temporal 325pm-No dizziness on cot but did complain of headache 2/10  328pm- BP: 122/78 HR:77 O2:99% T: 98F Temporal  330pm-Sat on side of bed with no dizziness 332pm-No dizziness, left facility with wife.

Unable to stand, had to crawl to nearby chair and call for wife. Thought might be dehydrated, extremely pale, tried to drink water, but began vomiting. BP was elevated, but no temperature. Tried to eat crackers and drink more water, but continued to violently vomit. Never felt so badly in entire life. No strength to stand or get up the stairs to be taken to ER, so had to call paramedics. When they arrived, BP had come down, but they felt needed to be transported to ER, so they took to healthcare facility at about 1:30 pm.

                                                Within 4hrs of receiving the 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine I began to experience ringing in the ears followed by onset of extreme headaches and body aches somewhat dissimilar from the flu. These aches felt like painful internal construction of the head neck back and thigh muscles. Severe pain in the left arm where I received the jab.  I was extremely fatigued and could barely make it from bed to the bathroom. I treated the condition with Tylenol 1g every 4hrs followed by 200mg of Motrin. I also ensured adequate fluid hydration and electrolytes 120&#43; oz per day. The symptoms continued for about 36hrs. I began to feel better but 48hrs later I relapsed with the onset of ringing ears then headache followed by extreme fatigue. I treated the 2nd round with continued bed rest over 3 days with Tylenol (1g) and Motrin (400mg). I eliminated Tylenol day 2. I reduced Motrin to half on Day 3. I felt better for 48hrs and again relapsed but only needed smaller 200mg doses of Motrin for a day along with bed rest. The ringing in the ears have been consistent since the onset of the symptoms 4hrs after receiving the 2nd shot. The ringing is greater when I?m active and late in the day. The ringing in the ears is less after min of 6hrs full sleep during the night. I have yet to be able to exercise since racing that 2nd dose. I?m slowly progressing in reducing the fatigue by consuming 30mL shots of ginger juice daily along with 500mcg of  Vitamin B12 as directed by my Dr.

We was leaving when his wife and his mother mentioned he had swollen eyes. Pt said he was feeling well and that his eyes were fine. However, family member insisted he had an allergic reaction to the vaccine and he mentioned he started to feel lightheaded and nervous afterwards. His BP was 107/81 mmHg and pulse 100 bpm and he mentioned he wanted to take something for allergies, so patient was given 50 mg Benadryl after confirming his weight (80 kg). After 15 minutes waiting, patient mentioned he was feeling fine, and he wanted to leave. BP was taken again and it was 125/76 mmHg and pulse was 89 bpm. Pt refused calling 911 because he was feeling ok and he did not feel his eyes swollen.

He and his wife were having a conversation. According to his wife, he seemed to become dazed. Their conversation just stopped. The car started to veer off the road and they were onto the rumble strips. He wasn&#39;t making a correction, so his wife had to tell him to drive back into their lane, but he overcorrected and ended up into the lane of oncoming traffic. He was able to correct that and pull the car off of the road. He and his wife switched so that she was driving. He seemed to have a glazed look on his face, but he didn&#39;t have any difficulty walking or getting in/out of the vehicle. He does not remember the incident of the car veering and overcorrecting. When they got to the track meet he felt tired and just laid down for 10-15 minutes. Afterwards, he felt like he was fine. They entire incident lasted about 30 minutes. He has been fine since.

Caller states he has an appointment with a neurologist and he&#39;s trying to get it moved up. Caller states his doctor wants to do a lumbar puncture to rule out MS or Parkinson&#39;s that sort of thing. Caller states but at this point they are trying to rule things out. Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

On Monday the 11th they operated on my left knee because there was a lot of inflammation, that same day the second knee became inflamed, I was hospitalized from April 11 to 17 with a lot of pain in both legs.   On April 21 I continued with a lot of pain and swelling in both legs and even in the ankles there was swelling. A rheumatologist doctor, because of the laboratory tests she conducted, did come to the conclusion that it was reactive arthritis caused by the Pfizer vaccine.

                                                The next morning I woke up with dizziness.   I experienced vertigo/dizziness over the course of a couple weeks.  Frequency of vertigo/dizziness began to decline after 5 days and was gone after about 10-12 days.  I&#39;ve never had vertigo before, and was not expecting it as a side-effect either.

                                                After the 1st dose (3/29/2021), neck inflammation started on the right-side of the neck. The neck inflammation got worse after the 2nd dose (4/19/2021). The neck inflammation is still present.    Starting 5/11/2021: Intense adrenaline surges started happening every night between 3 am-7 am. My heart feels like it is beating extremely hard. I have checked my pulse and it is normal during the events (ranges from 65-90 bpm). I have checked blood pressure and it is usually in the 120/80 range (normal for me). However, there have been occasions where blood pressure drops to 100/70. These adrenaline surges and hard heart beats tend to get better if I stand up and move around. It will get worse again if I lay down. I have these on occasion during the day, but I am usually able to calm myself down. I have had scenarios where I feel fine during the day, but will lay down. The hard heart beats start almost immediately. I&#39;m also exercise intolerant now. If I do anything more than a brisk walk, I feel very terrible and faint with a hard heart beat. One interesting data point, my father has the same symptoms and his started about the same general timeframe after his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after receiving my second COVID shot and right before I went to bed at 10pm I started getting chills.  My symptoms worsened as the night went on, I was shaking and could not get warm.  I also had a very bad headache and I had trouble lifting myself up.  At about 3am I started sweating and feeling feverish.  I got out of bed to take Tylenol and drink water, and had trouble walking and I was breathing heavy.   At 6am I decided to take a hot bath with Epsom salts to help with my aches and headache.  When I got out of the bath I felt very dizzy and fatigued and need assistance from my wife to get back in bed.  At about 9am I started feeling better.  I sat myself up and ate apples and salty tortilla chips and drank lots of water.  By 1pm I was able to walk without difficulty and I felt better with only a mild headache.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 46-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 12:15 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization.

The patient reported that he felt fine after the shot for the rest of the day and the first night other than the soreness where he received the shot. The patient went to bed around 11 pm and woke up the next day (14Jan2021) at around 6:30 am with very bad dizziness. He felt like his eyes were rolling around in his head which made him very nauseous and sick to his stomach. His wife called a friend who is a nurse and she said to keep an eye on him for a little while and see how he was in an hour or so. She said that if it gets worse call 911 otherwise get him to the clinic at 10 am. He reported that he was feeling much better by then but went to clinic at 10 and doctor saw him asked questions gave me something for nausea and dizziness. He felt good the rest of the day with slight lightheaded. He mentioned that he needs get his second shot on 03Feb2021 and was concerned about getting it. He inquired on what is the recommendation on getting dose #2. It was not reported if the patient been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The adverse event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received treatment for the adverse events. They gave me ondansetron (ZAFRAN ODT [orally disintegrating tablets]) 4 mg for nausea. The patient considered the events was non-serious.

I was vomiting with intense force but nothing was coming up. My abdomen was bloated to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand upright and breathing was very painful. I was in that condition for about 12 hours before the swelling began to lessen. Now, 2 days later, I am still unable to eat and drink as normal and have moderate gastrointestinal discomfort with bloating.

                                                I already suffer from mild tinnitus.  About 14 hours after the 2nd vaccine dose my tinnitus became noticeably worse for a period of about 24 hours.  I also experienced the typical flu-cold like symptoms after the 2nd vaccine dose including muscle ache, stiff and achey joints, and general I&#39;ll feel for a period of 8 after that began 14 hours after the 2nd dose was administered.  I experienced fatigue for roughly 4 days after the 2nd dose.   I had no symptoms nor adverse reaction after the 1st dose.  My biggest concern was the tinnitus.  The cold and flu like symptoms I understand should be expected.

                                                Started the night of the injection. Nausea. Felt like I was going to vomit. Kind of dizzy too. Went to bed to sleep it off. Woke the next morning feeling better. Still some light nausea. Had diarrhea though. But when using the bathroom  only a small amount would come out and it was mostly bile. That was all day yesterday (Saturday). No solid BM?s at all. Today I?m kind of constipated. When I feel the urge for a BM it?s little bile wrapped pellets. Def not my normal BM....  so, I haven?t had a solid, relieving BM   Since Friday and I?m starting to feel bloated. Hopefully this will work itself through.

                                                On March 25, 8 days after the vaccine shot in my left arm, I began experiencing intense pain on the left side of my neck and head. By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

I got out of bed.  While in the bathroom, I began to feel very lightheaded and passed out while I was washing my hands.  My wife heard me crash to the floor.    I returned to consciousness but passed out again while trying to stand, unresponsive to my wife.  I returned to consciousness after about 1 minute.  I stayed sitting for several minutes while my wife brought me some water.  I felt thirsty and it&#39;s possible I was dehydrated, but I had been drinking fluids (water) the day before as normal.  Due to the two fainting spells and a possible head injury, I went to the Emergency Room for treatment at approx. 2 am.

A 46-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose (at the age of 46 years old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient has no medical history. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  Since his stoke, he is doing better. He completely lost mobility on the left side of his body. His mobility on the left side of his body is slowly coming back. His job is in jeopardy. The doctors told him that there is no guarantee that he will regain full mobility. They did not give him a patient record card. If they did give him one, he left it at the house. He has been in the hospital ever since his stroke. They put him on blood thinners after his stroke. Whenever he was in the ambulance, he did not have high blood pressure. They were able to catch his stroke quick. They found they clot, but could not extract it from what he understood. Adverse events reqiored Emergency Room.  The patient was hospitalized on 01Apr2021. The outcome of clot was unknown and other events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Approx 27hrs after 2nd dose I felt my heart suddenly started irregular beats, arrhythmia with dizzy feeling, flush on face which lasted a minute or 2 followed by very rapid / hard beating of my heart (I could see my shirt move on my chest from the beating). This lasted for almost 10 minutes. Very scary. Paramedics were called about 5 minutes into the episode.  (I had a similar reaction of dizzy, flush with rapid and hard heart beat reaction after 1st dose about 5 minutes after it was given which lasted couple minutes then subsided).  When the paramedics arrived, I was laying down in my bed trying to relax and breath. By then the rapid and very hard beating of heart was calming down but was still elevated pulse for a resting position...~128bpm.  My BP was measured at 154/87.  They connected the 12point electrodes and the reading came back normal...only elevated pulse.  Paramedics ran 3 more scans during the  20 minutes they were there for...all came back normal.  My O2 was 100%. I elected to no go to ER since we live only 2 miles from the local hospital and I was feeling much better by then...but would go if I had another heart episode.  I have had none since.  Only other strange side effects was sore arm for 2 day and I notice is constant ringing in my ears all the time...strange.  I hope that will go away soon...very annoying.

I am an avid jogger/runner (5k and 10k and 13.1 miles). Since the vaccine was taken, I have not been able to run at the previous rate. Cannot complete a single mile without having to stop and massage legs muscles and stretch the joints.   The week prior to the second dose I was running 4 miles every other day and a long distance run weekly.  Also have not been able to complete my normal weight training routine. Arm, chest and back muscles shot in pain doing a previous dominate routine.  example, from doing a 100 repetitions with 25pounds dumber, I cannot do 20 repetitions with 15 pounds dumber without having to stop in pain. To be able to run, take pain killers and rub muscles with pain relieving creams before a run. 2. Fatigue, without changing diet or sleep habits, raising from the bed is hard. Feel weak and struggle to get out of bed. Not mental health issues, just physical weakness.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (father) or other non health care professional.   A 46-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left on 24Mar2021 as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Parkinsons diagnosed 12 years ago and dystonia diagnosed 8 years ago from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing states the patient has had four deep brain stimulations and was in neurological care and takes a lot of medications. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to receiving Covid 19 vaccine. On 24Mar2021, the patient had the Pfizer Vaccine and a day and a half later could not feel his legs and has not been able to walk since; states the vaccine was the only different thing he had and everything else was routine and going on for years and his dystonia did not just jump and he can&#39;t say the reason this happened but it should be looked at. He can&#39;t say the Pfizer Vaccine was the reason for the reported events and he can&#39;t say it isn&#39;t the reason. On 26Mar2021, the caller stated that in the morning but could have been the night before as the patient was in bed and said he could not feel his legs and couldn&#39;t walk; states he could not stand up to this day on an unknown date and was in a wheelchair and everything was done in a wheelchair. Caller stated the patient had nothing new and no kinds of other medication or vaccines done other than what was prescribed by his doctor. Stated he was healthy other than what the disease has done to him. Stated for treatment everything was exactly the way it has always been and they adjust his deep brain stimulations once in a while and basically try to help out the dystonia and the Parkinsons seems to be taken care of but the dystonia was really the culprit. Stated that the patient had the Pfizer Vaccine and a day and a half later could not feel his legs and had not been able to walk since, the patient went to the health care professional and was going back again next week and the health care professional tried to adjust the batteries and increased his medication to see if that would help and the increased medication did nothing and nothing changed. The medication that did nothing was Carvidopa or Levodopa or whatever it was called and he went from taking 2 pills twice per day to taking three pills twice per day after the incident with the Pfizer Vaccine trying to help out and nothing changed. Caller states for some reason the Pfizer Vaccine just went in and did something to some part of his brain and must have gone after the weakest point and he was only guessing this as no doctor has answers and they don&#39;t know. The patient had been Carvidopa Levodopa for 12 years. Patient was afraid to take 2nd dose which was scheduled on 14Apr2021, and the patient did not take that. The event he could not stand up to this day and was in a wheelchair and everything was done in a wheelchair was assessed as serious (disability).The adverse events resulted in physician office visit. The vaccination facility type was reported as hospital. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

                                                Patient was waiting in our observation area when he began to experience dizziness, cold sweats and tunnel vision.  He lay down on the floor, and our technician asked him if he was OK.  I immediately went out to him, and he told me he was already feeling better.  I had him put his feet up on the chair, and he told me that he thought this reaction was due to anxiety.  He was talking and breathing  normally.  I offered to check his blood pressure and get him some water, but he declined.  He rested on the floor for approximately 5 minutes and then said he was feeling well enough to go.

                                                Very minor light headedness the day after injection; typical sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 09:30 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high BP and Pre-diabetic, both from unknown dates. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergies. The patient experienced very minor light headedness the day after injection on Jan2021. It lasted throughout the day. Also reported typical sore arm on Jan2021. Neither of which required any medical attention. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient complained of feeling light-headed and a little dizzy at 10 minutes post-administration.  Pulse-oximetry applied revealed normal spO2, but tachycardia to 140bpm (this patient&#39;s resting HR is approximately 55-65).  Apple Watch data confirmed rapid increase in HR at that moment.  BP increased from normal baseline to about 150-160 SBP.  No chest pain reported.  No signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis (rash, wheezing, etc.).  HR gradually recovered to normal levels within 30 minutes and patient was released after 60 min observation.  Patient reported generalized fatigue in weeks following injection.   Nineteen (19) days after injection, patient developed unprovoked resting tachycardia to approximately 180bpm (following some moderate weigh-lifting exercise).  Symptoms did no resolve sufficiently and patient was transported by EMS to ER for evaluation

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

I also experienced headache, vertigo, chest heaviness, vertigo, and chills for 3 days  following the vaccine.  Still have the ringing.  I cancelled the 2nd vaccine.

This 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; borderline diabetes. Concomitant medications included losartan; alirocumab (PRALUENT, injection) on 20Jan2021. Since 23Jan2021, patient was dizzy all along and almost fainted and was still having symptoms of mild migraine and he don&#39;t know like some light sensitivity. Doctor believed it was from vaccine. Patient was wondering how long was this going to be last as he had second shot coming out. He didn&#39;t think it was an adverse reaction and he thought he should get the second shot. But this was continuing to me and it had already been two weeks and patient still having symptoms of mild migraine. Patient was worried about taking the second shot as a result. He had never had a migraine before and was told it was probably from the vaccine and that was not something he wanted to hear. Patient wanted to know if this was normal to still be having this side effect for this long. Patient was taking acetaminophen (for migraine), it was not a TYLENOL, it was from a different brand. Patient did liver and cholesterol test and blood test in Jan2021 at Cardiologist and they came back fine, nothing was found there. The outcome of event migraine was not resolved. The outcome of rest events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Within a half hour, I felt dizzy and light headed. in 45 minutes - I could barely stay awake. I had to stop driving. Within two hours, I had a bad headache. I became slightly agitated that day. The headache lasted throughout the day - I took Ibuprofen but that didn&#39;t help much. Sunday, the headache was still there. It wasn&#39;t a migraine; but intense. I was agitated.  My agitation level grew and my irritability grew and the headache I had the whole day. Sunday evening about 7 pm the agitation and irritability got very intense - I was having impulse control issues with it. I don&#39;t have anger issues but I wanted to yell at TV or throw my phone. From 8- midnight, I was lethargic and fatigued - I didn&#39;t have the energy to roll over;: had extreme anxiety I was sweating and having weird thoughts like harming my animals and harming myself; my  mind was racing and then I would get really depressed. Until about midnight, I have had past struggles with anxiety and depression - there had been a past feeling like this - but it was really extreme - it was worse night of my life. Lasted four hours, and finally I slept for about one hour. I remember thinking, I finally can take a breath. My racing thoughts were gone and sweating was gone. The irritability had subsided enough that I could try to gain control of my thoughts again. I had really bad nightmares the rest of that night; I was confused _ I didn&#39;t know where I was - confused about that - occurred about three different times until I got up at 5:30 am for work. To summarize, for the next week, I had moments of anxiety and depression. I had mental fog. I played pro football - and I had post concussion syndrome. It was very identifiable to what I had had. So this was occurring in moments - forgetful; depressed; and random moments of anxiety - like I was going to go play football again. 7-10 days - it got a little better each day. Ten days it took to subside. I still exercised and taking extra fluids to get back to my normal.  Exercised help. No fever occurred. With COVID - I had had a sense of anxiety and depression and some mental fog when I had COVID I didn&#39;t have it to this extreme.  Did not get the second dose.

                                                ~10 minutes after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine while sitting in the waiting area, I started feeling light headed and I thought I was going to pass out.  Medical personnel in the waiting area came over, had me lay down and provided cold packs.  They stated this was likely a vasovagal like response.  When I have donated blood in the past I have had a very similar reaction.

                                                After leaving facility, had numbness in tongue, trouble swallowing. Waited 20-40 more minutes, then felt dizzy and began to have hives in addition to previous reactions. I went to Urgent Care where they took vitals. Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated, throat was abnormal, and I had hives. They gave me antihistamine and steroid shot.  After 30minutes - and hours, vitals returned to normal.

ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.  Completed 5 day course of high dose steroids, 6 days of IVIG and on ongoing PLEX. Neurological improvement noted 3/25

I expected my shoulder to be sore as typical with previous vaccines I have received.  After dinner my should was very very sore and painful, but in a different way than I had experienced before.  The pain feels like it is in the joint rather than in the muscle.  The pain will subside if I keep my shoulder immobile and take Tylenol.  If I use my arm/shoulder the pain returns and worsens with use.  My range of motion is limited and becomes worse with use.   I will wait until the end of the weekend and seek medical treatment if this does not resolve.

                                                Got my first Pfizer shot on March 24 at 2 pm. The first day I felt way off like I was drunk or on some kind of drug that gets you high with bouts of dizziness and some major hypertension. My back and chest were very tight the whole time. The tension finally subsided around 11 pm that night but I was still uneasy. The 2nd day I felt ok in the morning and throughout the day until about 3 or 4 pm I started getting really nauseated and tired. I went to lay down to sleep and felt a little better when I woke an hour later. Day 3 I started feeling extremely tired and fatigued with some major chills. Basically slept most of that evening and throughout the night. Woke that next day and couldn&#39;t get that dizzy foggy feeling out of my head the whole day. Day 4-5 still bouts of dizziness, chills and fatigue with some nausea also I noticed I developed a wheezing dry cough which points towards respiratory distress. Day 6 still feeling yucky, tired, fatigued, some nausea and that dam cough. Today  03-31-21, still feeling weak and tired with some episodes of dizzy spells, nausea and respiratory distress cough.   Also forgot to mention on day 2 and 3 I had some major tingling on the right side of my head for most of the day. Felt like spiders crawling on my head and face. The last time I felt tingling like that I got shingles which also got me very sick and put me in the ER and ICU years ago. So there is also some post traumatic stress from that as well.  Made an appointment to see a Doctor on 03-30-21 to have my blood pressure checked and get an overall check up.  My blood pressure is elevated and stress levels are high with anxiety.  Dr prescribed me some anxiety medication. No other recommendations from the Doctor.

His blood pressure was very elevated in the systolic 170 range and he did require some IV labetalol.  The patient states he really has not missed any doses of his medications.

                                                First day after the COVID 19 second shot was good. Felt tired in the afternoon and slept early at 9 PM. Woke up at 1 AM and since then couldnt sleep. Later in the night got a sinking feeling like when you are coming down on an elevator at high speed. In the morning when I tried to get out of the bed I couldnt sit as I had sever Vertego. Finally had to ask my wife to help me sit. After few mins was ok then my wife walked to the restroom. I was feeling dizzy the whole time. I came back and was lying on the bed. Next time when I tried to wake up same problem. I was trying to sit and falling down. The dizziness was there for about couple of hours after that I didnt face that issue again. I never had Vertego problem in my life and this was a severe one on the second after taking the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Since that afternoon I am feeling normal but thought of reporting this adverse event.

                                                Difficulty operating a motor vehicle at speeds over about 45 mph. I drove to the first vaccination appointment that morning (3/2/2021) and everything was fine. Driving home from the jab I started to experience trouble driving my car when crossing a major bridge in Pittsburgh. The feeling was akin to the anticipatory feeling of being on a climbing roller coaster or drop ride in an amusement park. Elevated heart rate; disorientation and a sort of adrenaline like rush. The feeling returns every time I attempt to drive on a freeway/bridge/etc though local driving is fine. (I was driven to the 2nd jab.) The issue continues now, close to 2 months after it began 45 minutes after receiving the 1st jab. In the several months prior to the jab I was driving extensively with no issues.

                                                felt woozy and dizzy; bruising at the injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported for himself. A 47-years-old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number and expiration was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that he received his first vaccine dose and that night he felt woozy and dizzy. Patient also reported that he was on a blood thinner and experienced bruising at the injection site. He reported, it not red, it just looks bruised. The patient asked should he get the second dose after having side effects from the first. It was reported that he should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if he had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if he had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to received the second dose for any other reason could not be made by Pfizer. To refer him to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. His healthcare provider knows his health situation and had access to information that can better help inform this decision. The outcome of the events reported as unknown.

                                                getting lightheaded and dizzy all the time; Seizure; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) and a consumer (patient&#39;s ex-wife/ roommate) A 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER2613 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01May2021 (at the age of 47-year-old), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, ongoing seizures from 1991; patient was being hit in the head with a steel baseball bat 13 times, and had a lot of brain damage; and ongoing sleep. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) provided as no. Concomitant medications included ongoing topiramate (TROKENDI XR) for seizure, ongoing allopurinol (ELAVIL) for sleep, and medication for cholesterol and one for high blood pressure. Patient had been on topiramate a couple of months. They were working with him to get him better than he was because he was having a lot of the little ones. He got the pill packs. He tried the little compartment things and they weren&#39;t working. Roommate suggested they try the pill packs to make it easier. There was the time on the packs. The patient experienced seizures on 13May2021; getting lightheaded and dizzy all the time on unknown date. Patient&#39;s second dose was scheduled 22May2021. Due to symptoms that he experienced he was afraid to take second dose. Patient had petite mal seizure last night on 13May2021, he got ahold of the doctor and got an appointment with his family doctor. They don&#39;t know about the seizure yet. Patient was feeling ok until he got the shot. Now, he was back to getting lightheaded and dizzy all the time. Patient got social security and had a hard time remembering his phone number. Patient&#39;s ex-wife clarified that patient called the doctor and got an appointment. He had upcoming appointment. The doctor wanted him to go to the emergency room. She had known him since 2005. When he had a mild seizure the ER doesn&#39;t do anything for him. They just leave him in the bed and wait until he comes to his senses. She just told patient to go in his room and lay down and offered him paracetamol (TYLENOL) and all that stuff. She couldn&#39;t move him when he was having one of the worse seizures because he turns into a board. She tried to get him aware. They didn&#39;t last long. Patient had grand-mal seizures since the age of 18 after being hit in the head with a steel baseball bat 13 times. He had a lot of brain damage. The brain can&#39;t fix itself. She was the only one that knows how to handle him. Patient&#39;s ex-wife listed at the doctor office because patient had a hard time explaining things and stutters a lot, he can&#39;t answer right away. The seizure patient had yesterday was a petite mal seizure. It wasn&#39;t a full blown grand mal seizure. He had three different phases of seizures. He had the staring one where he was looking out in space. Then he had the next one that happened in the car. He sat down and put his head back to relax. She thought he was taking a break, but it was a seizure. She touches him to focus and get him back. At night was when he has the worst ones where he looses control of his bladder, foams at the mouth, and turns into a board. He can&#39;t bend. He has only had 3 of those in the time she had known him. The other ones he had quite often. The quicker he comes out of it the less headache he has after it. If they let it run its course he has a bad headache and nausea. She tries to open his eyes because he comes out better. One time when he had grand mal seizure she couldn&#39;t get him rolled over and had to get help. Even though it was saliva and he was foaming at the mouth she was afraid he would choke on it. He had one starring seizure shortly before the COVID vaccine. He had them a lot. If they take blood or run scan it won&#39;t show patient had a seizure. For a little while patient and his roommate weren&#39;t together. If he did have seizure during that time he got himself out of it. He has only had 3 bad ones since 2005. Patient told his doctor that he thought it was related to the COVID shot. Patient&#39;s ex-wife didn&#39;t believe that was what caused the seizure (She thought if it was related it would have happened within 20 minutes of getting the vaccine). She thought he just had one. It played in his mind that he had the shot. Patient&#39;s brain stopped growing when he was 18 due to damage. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events Seizures, Dizziness and the suspect BNT162B2.

                                                Patient experienced usual arm soreness from the shot, but as the days wore on, the soreness progressed into pain. Within a few days, patient realized the pain was more than a usual vaccination soreness. Within 7 days, Patient&#39;s shoulder was making loud popping sounds, and he kept feeling like it was falling out of socket. Basic movements like combing hair, teeth brushing, driving, and typing were painful and difficult with his left arm. Patient visited a physical therapist, and he said it isn&#39;t rotator cuff, but it could be a laberal tear. An MRI would better diagnose the issue. The physical therapist recommended 6 weeks of immobility on his shoulder. Patient purchased a brace and is wearing that to prevent mobility. Patient had not done anything else to injure his shoulder and was perfectly healthy when he presented himself to be vaccinated.

                                                At 19:24 client received dose 1 of the COVID19 Pfizer vaccine (Lot #EW0187 Exp 08/31/21).  Client?s adult daughter was accompanying him.  After receiving the vaccine, client and his daughter walked to the observation room and sat down.  At 19:57 client communicated to EMT1 that 2 of the fingers on his right hand (pointer &amp; middle fingers) were tingling and felt a little numb.  EMT1 radioed Lead RN for notification purposes.  Lead RN arrived in the observation room at 19:59. Client informed Lead RN that he was not experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, or trouble breathing, but his fingers were numb, and he felt a little dizzy.  AT 20:02, EMT2 took client?s vitals (BP:  148/102, HR: 88, RR: 14 SPO2 Sat: 99%) and confirmed that he was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and self.  Client stated to Lead RN that he has no known allergies, and his underlying conditions consist of diabetes and high blood pressure.  He also stated that he takes Metformin and another medication for his diabetes that he could not remember the name of.  Client could not provide the name of the high blood pressure medication he has previously taken.  Client also stated that since the COVID19 pandemic started, he hasn?t taken much of his blood pressure medication because he has not been able to see his doctor.  Client implied that if he still has high blood pressure, it is not being managed.  Client stated he was starting to gain feeling back and his fingers and that maybe his hand fell asleep because of the way he was sitting.  Lead RN asked client when he had last eaten and/or drank something.  Client stated he had not consumed anything since 12:00.  EMT1 gave client a granola bar and a bottle of water.  After eating the granola bar and drinking the water, client stated he was starting to feel better and was feeling very little, if any, dizziness.  At 20:18, EMT2 took client?s vitals (BP: 140/102, HR: 83, RR: 14, SPO2 Sat: 98%).  Client stated he felt totally fine and was ready to go.  At 20:20 Lead RN educated client on high blood pressure signs and symptoms, the importance of blood pressure management, and recommended client contact his medical provider for follow-up.  Lead RN also educated client on the side effects and adverse effects of the COVID19 Pfizer vaccine.  Lead RN instructed client to go to urgent care if he started to experience extreme side effects and/or dizziness again and to call 911 if he started to experience any difficulties breathing, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  Client stated he understood.  Client left with his daughter at 20:23 walking with a steady gait.

I have had lightheadedness for the past week.

                                                I received the first dose of Pfizer EK5730 at 18:07 on 12-30-2020.  For the first day my arm was a bit sore but nothing to bad.  The next few days 48-72 hours later I started to have many more  symptoms, some minor to sever including joint pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.  lesser included some nauseas.   The joint pain was so bad at one point i had to pull over while driving.  on 1-2-21.  as of writing this now 14 days out I still have some joint pain especially in my arms.  No other symptoms of note.   I would add that I tested positive for COVID -19 on 10-18-2020 and was not released from quarantine until 11-5-20  I did seek treatment during this time through by calling my Dr. did not require any hospitalization.

The throwing up only happened that morning but the dizziness continued. The dizziness happened when I turned my head to quickly or bent over.   After the second dose (taken at 2:30pm on 2/11/2021) I have dry heaved nearly every morning since. I&#39;m not throwing up anything but the dry heaving happens nearly every morning and continues to even today (3/2/2021). I don&#39;t feel nauseous even though I dry heave... which seems strange. I still feel like I have vertigo, which I did not have prior to taking the COVID19 vaccine.

A 48-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration, on 05Feb2021 03:00 PM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure, pancreatic cancer in 2012 and fully recovered no treatment since 2013 and NED all scans have been clear. Concomitant medications included ondansetron (ZOFRAN), prochlorperazine (COMPAZINE SPANSULE), and oxycodone (OXYCODONE). The patient previously took Zocyn and experienced migraines (Allergies to medications, food, or other products: The antibiotic Zocyn causes migraines). On 06Feb2021 at 12:45 AM, the patient woke up in the middle of the night with ears plugged with fluid (cannot hear well) and had a loss of balance. He was unstable walking around. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was unknown if patient received treatment for the reported adverse events. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

Pain requires walking with a limp. Second shot was in left arm and knee joint pain occurred in the right knee approximately 18 hours after.   I now find it difficult to walk normally on both knees. Pain at times is 7/10.  No previous knee issues.

Tried warm shower and OTC Meds but no change.  It was no better Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.  Went to hospital ER on Sunday 3/22 for x-ray etc. and diagnosed with calcification tendinitis.   Received 800mg Ibuprofen script.  Feeling slightly better today with more range of motion but still cannot lift arm much.  Still very painful at the core of the joint.

After 5 min, patient reported feeling light-headed and tried to stand up. The patient sat down on the floor and leaned against the wall. Patient was able to stand and walk to the provider room for closer observation. Patient felt hot and looked pale. The provider placed a blood pressure cuff on the patient, at which point the patient slumped forward and stopped breathing. A carotid pulse was not able to be appreciated. The patient was pulled to the floor, positioned airway open and was given oxygen. BP was 96/40. Blood sugar was checked (104) and the AED pads were placed. EMS was called. AED advised no shock, patient had a pulse and was breathing. Patient gradually became alert, though reported not feeling well. Patient was disoriented and was not aware of passing out nor the current event. Repeat BP 115/50. Patient began vomiting (~300-400 mL). Patient left with EMS to be evaluated at local Emergency Department.   Of note, patient reports history of vasovagal syncope events 2/2 to various situations.

No treatment to date, just happened last couple of days. NOTE: I had a surgical procedure (to fix a hiatal hernia, laparoscopic procedure) on Monday 03/29.  Outpatient procedure but was under general anesthesia.  This procedure was done in a hospital 5 days post the first vaccine dose.

After 10 minutes , One other person came to our terminal reported that there is a person on the floor. I rushed to check on him. He was on the floor flat . I asked him if he is ok and if I can call 911. He said he is fine . He was helped to sit on the chair. He was wearing a black mask and seating. I asked him if he wants to me to call 911. He said he is feeling better. There was blood dripping out the mask. I asked him to check . His lips were split and his mouth was bloody. He fell flat on his face, that resulted in the bloody mouth. I gave him a ice pack and sat next to him . He called his wife and waited in the same area. I sat next to him. His wife came in and took him to the immediate care .

                                                7 days after vaccine I had a pretty intense, unprovoked anxiety attack. I was not under any stress, have never had anything like this occur, was not doing anything strenuous and all of a sudden had what I thought might even be a stroke or heart attack. I walked back to the house and took BP and it was 172/75 and pulse rate was only 64...but I was sweating, faint feeling, blurred vision, completely exhausted and it felt like my heart was pounding...but it wasn?t.??  I took BP multiple times but it was fine.  Just a really strange anxiety attack I guess that lasted a few hours.  I wasn?t worried about it and was t going to report it but have had 3 other people who unsolicited told me about their anxiety attack between 5 -7 days after shots. Two were phizer and one was Modena. Figured I would report it in case it helped someone else to not panic if they had an event like this.  It was quite scary and I don?t get worried about things like that!

Evolved into joint pain that would not resolve with medication.   Developed a loss of range of motion and pain that mimicked a rotator cuff tear.  This worsened over months.  Doctor prescribed meds and PT.  After PT I suffered a partial tear of the biceps tendon.  MRI pending.  Shoulder pain improved after the tear.

This continued for four full days afterwards before easing off on the fifth day, and gone by the sixth.  During this time I also had some confusion and difficulty comprehending reading and verbal explanations. Unsure what day it was. I found myself misspeaking words with the wrong meanings. I also was confused if I had completed tasks such as going for a scheduled unrelated blood test, taking my car in for maintenance, etc, and could not recall if I had done these things or if they still needed done.   I would stay awake no more than a few hours, 5 at most, then sleep for 8-10 hours. This went on until the fifth day.

Endorses nausea, confusion. Has extensive medical history. Patient has signs of sepsis with likely bacterial infection acute cystitis/pyelonephritis.  His lactate and procalcitonin are unremarkable and vitals remained stable however he does have an elevated total bilirubin as a possible sign of a more serious systemic response.  The patient does have chronic cirrhosis and persistent fever and tachycardia.  Given these clinical findings he is referred for admission for IV antibiotics and further close monitoring. Unfortunately, urine cultures were not sent.  His blood cultures however did grow 2 of 2 bottles positive for Klebsiella pneumonia.  These are both sensitive to Levaquin.  In the course of his hospitalization, he has improved.  He is now requesting discharge.  Will discharge home on p.o. Levaquin.  Is discharged in improved condition.

                                                I felt fine after the shot, but two hours later, my throat felt like it was closing and it hurt in a way I&#39;ve never felt before. I had a bad migraine and my whole body was sore. My blood pressure was high for me at 143/94 with a heart rate of 94. I trend at 120/80 with  a heart rate around 90. I take my blood pressure regularly to help manage Type II Diabetes.   I was concerned with my throat, as the other symptoms seemed normal for the vaccine. It was very uncomfortable. I phoned the nurse line and was told to have someone bring me to the ER to check me out and take a Benadryl. I took the Benadryl and packed for the ER with meds and ID and my friend drove me. I was still uncomfortable enough to warrant wanting to go and had become very dizzy.   When we got to the ER there was a wait and I went to my friend&#39;s car until called. After about 30 minutes (about 45 minutes after the Benadryl) my throat released and felt much better. My vitals were taken and seemed normal. The normal aches of the vaccine didn&#39;t concern me enough to stay, so I returned home.   My symptoms remain what seem to be normal reactions to the vaccine: sore joints, slight headache, slightly sore throat, Charlie horse feeling at the injection site. Nothing of major concern. My largest worry was with the throat feeling closed, but it appears the Benadryl took care of it.

                                                Strong shoulder pain started on Sat 4/17 in the early morning that woke me up. Went away by 10a after taking tylenol and having a coffee. Sun 4/18: pain again woke me up and was more severe. Had to get out of bed to move around as pain was pretty bad. Went to urgent care. Found nothing serious (not a heart attack or clots, etc). Referred me to go see my PCP if it did not resolve in a few days. Thu 4/22: went to PCP. Pain had subsided for the most part, but started having reduced range of motion when lifting arm straight forward...could not get past 90 degrees (straight out) without pain and a feeling of physical binding in the joint. Suspected bursitis. Prescribed a steroid pack and muscle relaxer.  Sat: 4/24: my son noticed my shoulder blade sticking out when attempting to reach for a glass of water while seated. Decided to make appt with an orthopedic. Fri 4/30: went to orthopedic. Took xray. Found no physical damage, trauma, etc. Noticed winged scapula as reason for lack of range of motion. Prescribed physical therapy. Fir 5/14: still same lack of range of motion and no pain. Went to first PT appt. They took range of motion measurements and agreed I was limited. Tested for other pain or signs of trauma and found none. Prescribed a PT regimen.   After my own research combined with symptoms, and no physical trauma as the source. My suspicion is Parsonage Turner Syndrome brought on by the vaccination.

However, he was found down in the parking lot - had hit his head on the sidewalk, and had a profusely bleeding head wound which required he be seen in the urgent care for wound care which included staples. He denies recalling the event, so it is unsure whether he fell, had a seizure, or if it was a syncopal event. Pt&#39;s partner reported he was likely in alcohol withdrawal d/t history of alcohol abuse and last drink 3 days prior.

I haven&#39;t ever had issues like this before leading me to think the cause may be related to the vaccine.   I&#39;m reporting this in case there is some sort of pattern that others may be reporting.   I say it&#39;s a small chance that it&#39;s related to the vaccine, but I wanted to report it since it was so unusual for me.  In item 21 below I am checking Dr. visit.  Although I have not visited a doctor yet, it looks as if I may have to.

A 48-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EP7533), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Mar2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 48-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EN6204) on 09Mar2021 (at the age of 48-years-old) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and had no events following the first dose. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On 30Mar2021, the patient experienced body aches, muscle pain and joint pain in his hips, shoulders, knees, and back of neck. On Apr2021, the patient experienced a mild fever and could hardly walk. On an unspecified date, the patient&#39;s voice had been messed up. The course of events was follows: On 30Mar2021 at around 20:00-21:00, the patient had full body aches (further described as muscle pain and joint pain in his hips, shoulders, knees, and back of neck ) and then it got a little better for a couple of days. The patient woke up on 31Mar2021 and it was really bad. He tried to work through it. However, he finally went to the doctor and then the Emergency Room (ER) for the first time. He was put on meloxicam 15mg for 4 days and it didn&#39;t do anything, although it was reported he didn&#39;t take them all. On Apr2021, the first week after the second vaccine (also reported as a few days later, even up to 5 days), the patient had a mild fever, for one or two days it got up to 100.3 degrees F. The patient had not had respiratory problems or breathing problems. When the meloxicam didn&#39;t work, the patient went back to the ER. He received a steroid shot while there. He received 5 days of 60mg daily of prednisone. The patient felt fine when he was taking it, but when it wore off, he crashed real hard and was right back to where he could hardly move. After the prednisone wore off, he went back to the ER for the third time, on approximately 23Apr2021, because he could hardly walk. He was told to take ibuprofen and paracetamol (TYLENOL) until he could get into see his primary care. That was probably for about a week. The patient saw his new primary care and was so bad he had to use a wheelchair. The patient had regular blood panels completed with unknown results. The provider put him on the second round of prednisone, but he was told he couldn&#39;t keep taking it because it could really screw him up. He was prescribed prednisone 10 mg tablets to take 6 tablets for 3 days (for a total of 60mg), then 4 tablets for 3days, then 2 tablets for 3 days, then 1 tablet for 3 days and stop. He felt good at the beginning, but as the dosage went down, the medication wore off, his pain came back real bad. He was hurting really bad because he was tapering off the steroid, prednisone. He went in &#34;last Friday&#34; and they put him on duloxetine (CYMBALTA) 30mg by mouth once a day. He was also taking over-the-counter naproxen sodium (ALEVE) 220 mg about every 8 hours for pain. The patient was checked for &#34;rheumatoid stuff&#34; with unknown results. The patient was put on duloxetine because he was normally a very active person, but this had been debilitating, some days he cannot even get off the couch because of the pain and not being able to walk. He just started a new job and now he&#39;s not been able to work. For example, &#34;today&#34;, the patient can hardly lift his arms above his head because his shoulders hurt so bad. The patient reported that the muscle and joint pain persisted, but some days the pain got real bad. &#34;Yesterday&#34; he couldn&#39;t even get up hardly to go use the restroom, he had to use a cane. This morning, he has been able to get up better today. The pain is just always there since this all happened. He can&#39;t move very good, it hurt so bad. The patient also added that his voice had been messed up since all of this. The patient underwent the following lab tests on 27Mar2021 COVID-19 rapid test: negative, on 09Apr2021 COVID-19 test: negative, on 10Apr2021 COVID-19 rapid test: negative. The clinical outcome of mild fever, voice had been messed up and hardly walk was unknown, of body aches and muscle pain and joint pain in his hips, shoulders, knees, and back of neck was not resolved.  No follow-up attempts are needed; no further information expected.

                                                I was playing ice hockey on April 10, 2021 when I started to experience shortness of breath.  Coming to the bench between shifts is part of the game and that time on the bench is used to recover (both for your muscles and for your cardiovascular system).  However, towards the latter part of the game, I continued to be short of breath even while sitting on the bench.  Then in the last 10 minutes or so of the game, I fell to the ice for no reason.  It was as if my muscles had just totally failed.  I thought the shortness of breath may have been a sign of a Covid infection since I had not reached the 14 day period after my second shot.  So I went to urgent care to get a Covid test.  My test came back negative, but the doctor was concerned with my symptoms, so he took an x-ray of my heart and an ECG.  He said that he noticed a blur around my heart, but didn&#39;t have any explanation.  He thought I was in very good health, so he gave me a list of heart specialists to contact if I had another &#39;episode&#39;.  Fortunately, I did not have another episode.  The only reason that I am submitting this incident is because I understand the administration is having an emergency meeting to review cases of an inflamed heart.  I am not sure my situation was an inflamed, but I wanted to have my episode documented in case my situation was a temporary adverse reaction to the vaccine.

                                                3/25: Approx 5 mins after injection, started breathing quickly and became lightheaded. Moments later, heart rate elevated north of 190 bpm and blood pressure went up to approx 180/100. Developed dry mouth (was very thirsty) and shaking/chills. Took about 60 minutes to stabilize. Went to ER for evaluation and tests around 2:30P. Received a liter of fluid. Both EKG and Bloodwork was indicated as normal. Released from hospital around 6P. Slept through most of the night.   3/26: heart rate was erratic all day. Would race and then stabilize throughout the day/night. Extremely lethargic. No trouble breathing (was able to breathe and take deep breathes) but took effort to breathe.  3/27: 1:40A woke up heart began racing at close to 200 bpm. Dry mouth, shakes. Similar to what I experienced immediately following the vaccine shot. Went to ER out of precaution. Symptoms stabilized after about an hour. Hospital did EKG, blood work and chest X-ray. all were normal, lungs were clear. However, glucose and bilirubin were both slightly elevated.  3/29: Still feeling lethargic. Heart rate has stabilized some but is still erratic. It  easily increases from simply walking around the house (much more than usual).   3/30: Scheduled appointment with primary care physician 3/31: Scheduled appointment with cardialogist

                                                I began to experience positional vertigo, which is not something I&#39;ve ever experienced.  Certain angles of the head and motion of the body, such as turning over in bed, would trigger it.  There was a &#34;woozy&#34; feeling that persisted as well.  This started the evening of 4/1 and has mostly cleared up by now, 4/7.  On the advice of my primary internal MD, I sought evaluation at an urgent care clinic.  The doctor performing my exam stated that, based on my empty medical history and no recent illnesses, he suspected that the body&#39;s immune system reaction  caused an inner ear disturbance, leading to the vertigo.

He had headache, nausea, disoriented.  Then he went to bed, woke up at 9:00 AM and had a seizure, which he has had in the past but it had been over a year.  He rested after the seizure and knew what to do and it took 2-3 days to recover from that due to the weakness in the legs, disoriented.   He has gotten stronger and is pretty much back to his normal self.  He has not had any additional seizures since then.   He had his FU physical today and she is aware of the seizure and told them to report the incident.

Severe enough that upon onset I am unable to stand and must come to the ground to seek stability.  Also experiencing mild cold sweats during these attacks.

This has since migrated down my rib cage. I also experienced nausea, dizziness, headache, and muscle aches the following two days. Those have since subsided.

                                                Started experiencing some dizziness on March 8th that lasted for approximately 3 weeks. Did get the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and a week later felt a sort of hot feeling in my head similar to that ballon sensation when first coming down with the flu but nowhere near as intense. The dizziness was worst on March 10th then slowly resolved itself over the next few weeks. It was mild to moderate in intensity, I could feel a continuation of movement after turning my head sideways, it felt like the head was still going. Strange. I was still able to go to work but the effect was noticable. The only variables in my life recently were beginning Humira on Feb 2nd 2021 and getting the series of Pfizer Covid vaccines on Feb 19 and March 12. I did notify my gasteroenterologist because at first I assumed it was the Humira. He said that is not a side effect. On further research I have seen a lot of people reporting vertigo several weeks out after the Covid shots as if the antibody formation produces and inflammatory response in the ear in some patients. Unknown the symptoms are related to the shot or not. I had one outbreak of Meniere&#39;s Disease in 2006 and has not recurred. Perhaps the vaccine can cause a recurrance?

I started with severe vertigo and left ear pressure on 4-3-21. I have never had this problem in my life. I was okay by 4-5-21, and I though everything was fine. On 4-15-21, the severe ear pressure in my left ear returned along with the severe vertigo. I have now had 24-7 vertigo daily since 4-15-21. I went to my family doctor, on 4-16-21.

It has taken approximately 3 weeks for my HR to return close to baseline at rest but my diastolic BPs remain in the 90s (my resting baseline is 120-130/70-80 BP, 60-70 HR).  I am now 4 1/2 weeks post-2nd dose and still 130-140/90s but HR 70s.  Also, I had been diagnosed with CIDP earlier in the year and since the 2nd dose I have been increasingly fatigued and have pronounced hand and foot weakness each passing week--I have walking difficulty at this time and am unable to grasp and lift even 3# weights.

                                                Experience two large heart palpitations and what seemed stopped beating for a second, this was followed by tremendous pressure in my head, I thought I was experiencing a stroke.  I felt like I was going to black out and was having tightness in my chest , my wife took me to the E.R.  I had an EKG done and it not show any arrhythmia and CT scan of my head did not show any abnormality.  They scheduled me to follow up with cardiologist.  The whole week I experienced the following symptoms: Tightness and sharp pains in chest; Difficulty breathing, especially at night (had to sleep sitting up on couch one night and another night woke up with difficulty breathing , appeared to be the biggest problem when laying flat).  Would get out of breath walking up stairs; Moments I would get really light headed with a feeling like I could pass out; Symptoms last until the 4/16 , when they finally went away.  Follow up with Cardiologist, who scheduled an electrocardiogram and stress tests on 5/7.  The tests results showed that I had a healthy heart and no underlying conditions. I&#39;m 49 and never have experienced any cardiac events. before or have a family history of cardiac disease. I have no known allergies either.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He was not able to walk over to the bench from his seat, so I had to help him from his seat onto the floor to lay down. After laying down and drinking water, he started to regain color to his face. After laying down for roughly 30 minutes he felt strong enough to stand up and walk to the bench where he then sat for an additional 20 minutes.

                                                started getting dizzy about a week after the shot. about two weeks after the shot the dizziness is worse. I fell at work when I was just standing by my desk when I suddenly became extremely dizzy. At home I am having to hold onto things to help with balance. I am also having headaches, tinnitus, confusion, some mild congestion, and extreme tiredness. The vaccine is the only thing thing that is different the last couple of months. None of my medications have changed. I am due for the second shot next week, but I am not getting it due to the side effects I am experiencing.

Progressed to affect both arms within several hours. Numbness, cold, burning sensations, tingling. Also feeling of weakness and slight loss of motor control. Symptoms continued to occur intermittently for around 6 days affecting the arms and legs along the outer part of the limbs. At one point I had almost no feeling in my lower legs. I still have numbness/loss of feeling in the outside portion of my left thigh which became worse after the second does of the vaccine, but has persisted since my first does of the same vaccine. I also experienced severe stiffness and strong pain in my spine. The pain affected different parts of my spine but the worst of it was concentrated in my lower back, which lasted several days.

                                                After the vaccine I waited 15 minutes before returning to my desk.  After sitting at my desk for 10-15 minutes I began to feel light headed/dizzy.  I was having a difficult time concentrating and my immediate supervisor noticed right away and sent me home.  Walking out of the workplace I was extremely dizzy and dropped my bag once, but thankfully didn&#39;t break my laptop.  That evening I began to feel an extremely sore throat and nausea.  For the next several days 7-8 days I had a wet cough with thick yellow mucus, and fatigue.  After 2 weeks I slowly began to have less of a cough.  15 days (day of this report) my cough is minimal but still present.  Symptoms are continuing to lessen daily.

Injection site pain - feels like been punched in arm. Headache in the evening. Night chills and complained of &#34;tight&#34; (not acute) chest pain... but no breathing problems. Morning fever of 101F. Headache, Dizzy, Fatigue, Muscle Pain (esp in legs, asif he had &#34;run a marathon&#34;). He spent most of the day &#34;resting&#34;.  Evening on day two, we noticed a large bump under his vaccinated arm. Radius about 5cm - larger than what I know swollen lymph nodes to look like - almost looks like a bicep between his armpit and nipple. Tender to touch. Morning of day three (48 hours after vaccine) bump under his arm remains and all other symptoms seem milder.

I got in my house and told my wife I was not feeling right and started to notice a dizziness coming on. I was to call the pharmacy to find out what I should do, but noticed my heart rate was up, I looked at my Apple watch monitor and my BPM was 164. I felt flush and told my wife to call 911. Ambulance arrived and took my vitals and ( I do not recall the blood pressure, but it was high for me) when they put me into the ambulance I began to shake uncontrollably and then began to sweat profusely. They took me to the emergency room, but did not administer any drugs. The Dr. came in and said he did not think it was related to the vaccine, but my personal Dr. agreed with me based on my medical history that it had to be related to the vaccine. My resting heart rate (I monitor this daily) is between 45 - 60 and my last blood pressure reading at my yearly physical on April 2nd, 2021 was 100/70.

                                                Patient made an appointment for the COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer). Patient let us know that he has medical induced anxiety. He has passed out from random medical appointments in the past. Patient was sitting within eye view of the pharmacy. A passing by gentleman said &#34;Dude, are you ok?&#34;. I looked over and the gentleman was no longer in his chair. Customer helped gentleman into the chair. The nurse who administered the shot and myself (pharmacist) ran out with the emergency kit. Patient was conscious, but had no color in his face. We gave him water, orange juice, and moist towel for his forehead. Nurse took pulse, it was within normal range. Called 911, EMTs arrived. Patient declined any more help. He walked out of the pharmacy area. Total time of event: 15 minutes.

                                                Was flying on 2 Apr 21 at cruise about 1 hour into flight, experienced loss of color in vision, went from full color to red and gray, somewhat washed out, experienced lightheadedness and a bit of disorientation but not dizziness. Needed to use the bathroom and try to move to improve circulation and had to think about moving my body. I was not uncoordinated but my steps and balance were deliberate vs. unconscious and automatic. I was able to walk down the aisle to the lavatory without any problem but my vision did not immediately improve as I had hoped.  I went into the lavatory and leaned against the side (I&#39;m 6&#39;4&#34; and it was the rear lavatory on a 737). I was not dizzy and my lightheadedness began to clear up slowly as I urinated. The color was also coming back slowly as I finished up and walked back to my seat, again, I had to think about each step and my balance, although I was okay walking back. As soon as I sat down, I began sweating profusely. It lasted about two minutes or less, not long at all and I didn&#39;t get wet from the sweat. As suddenly as the sweat came, it went. My eyesight went back to normal and I felt nothing had happened. I am sure I was awake, aware and lucid the entire time, although it felt like what I imagine a psychedelic episode would be like (I&#39;ve never used any form of hallucinogen, however). I was back to normal when I disembarked the aircraft, felt no adverse or lingering effects either. Nothing to report since.

Symptoms tapered off over 3-5 days. Similar experience with 2nd vaccine but less pronounced with a shorter timeframe, tapering off after 2-3 days. Strongest side effects after first vaccine, symptoms did not become noticeable until a couple of hours after it was administered, increasing next 24 hours before lessening over time. Basically identical to long covid symptoms but lasting only for a few days after vaccinations and not before.

For the first 13 minutes I was talking to my wife, joking, etc.  I felt fine.  However, after 13 minutes or so, I started to felt light heading and week.   Then started to sweat and then I couldn&#39;t speak.  I felt like passing out.   My wife told me that the a man was trying to told we up and prevent me from falling.   I could hear what others were saying.  My wife states I turned pale, eyes looked stright ahead, and my mouth was distorted.  This came all at once and within a minute experienced all these symptoms.  The pharmacy staff gave me an eppy shot to get me back, then I was told to lay down on the floor.  I came to withing a minute or two and felt much better.  They had called 911 for an ambulence to come out.   The responders checked me out (vitals) and all looked fine, but I was highly advised to go with them to the ER to get checked out.

This was followed by 2 weeks of regular PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s noted by my self. This did not seem to be related to any kind of anxiety since I have never had anxiety problems.   I eventually had an echo cardiogram on  03/30/2021 which resulted as normal I also wore a Ziopatch for 2 weeks from 03/30/2021 which resulted as normal. By the time I was able to be tested most of my symptoms had resolved.

I don&#39;t remember exactly when but it was it was very noticeable the following day after receiving the first shot (and very possibly that night) and continued to worsen for the next few days. I&#39;ve have very mild tinnitus most of my life, however this is *far* worse than anything I have ever experienced (can hear it very clearly over day-time background noise, conversations, etc. whereas before could only hear it when it was relatively quiet.) It has been 3 weeks and has not abated, and in fact is probably continuing to grow worse. It is probably noteworthy that within minutes of receiving the shot, a got quite light headed and my face felt slightly numb for a period of an hour or two. These symptoms went away, however the tinnitus has not.

                                                I slowly started developing body aches the evening of 01/26/21.  Later that evening my balance felt a little off if I turn my head or body too quickly.  I got up in the morning of 01/27/21 to get ready for work and feel light headed if I turn my head or try to walk normally and when I started to get into my car. I didn?t feel it was safe to drive so I didn?t.  Still having body aches this morning as well. But the light headedness is new. I didn?t feel that with the first vaccine dose.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

I hit my head on a chair when I was falling and cut my head. I stayed laying down because I was still dizzy and hot. They called the squad and did vitals and I was fine. I sat there for about another half an hour and I went home. I have felt fine ever since. Only thing that hurt was my head from the fall.

                                                I was given the first shot and sent to an observation room. I felt slightly flushed, it went away. By the evening, I started to feel flushed again. I commented to my wife that I felt like my blood pressure was up. (I don&#39;t have high blood pressure). That is the best way I can describe it. I can&#39;t recall if the ringing in my ears was noticeable at that time. My the next day I could still feel the flushed feeling and the ringing  was clearly noticeable and increased over time, until it can overcome TV or someone speaking to me. I also had a feeling of persistent light headedness. About Feb 3 I had pain in my ear and went to a clinic. I was diagnosed with a minor ear infection (right). I was given and took a course of anti-biotics. The infection went away but the ringing never did, sometimes it would lessen, but always louder than prior to the shot. I went ahead and took the second shot on Feb 11, thinking my problem was probably and ear infection. I the ringing could get so loud it would wake me up and keep me awake. On Feb20 I woke up to very loud ringing, nausea, and general feeling of unease. I went to a clinic the next day. I was told there was probably some inflammation and was given a steroid shot. After about 4 hrs the ringing lessened and I felt better, the first relief I had from the start. On Feb 23, I saw my ENT Dr. He gave me a course of steroids and ordered a brain MRI. The MRI came back with negative results...no abnormal indications. The ringing is starting to increase again as of the last several days.

                                                About 4 hours after the shot (on Monday), I developed pain in my left leg--particularly the left buttock and left shin. The pain rapidly became worse. Walking became quite difficult.  Tuesday, I received a steroid injection from my doctor. The pain got slightly better over the next few days. Saturday, I started a course of oral steroids: 20mg prednisone, three times per day. Symptoms have been improving significantly, although as of today (Tuesday) there is still some pain.  The pain was specific to my leg. I didn&#39;t get any other aches.

                                                Within 24 hours I developed chest pain about 2 inches to left of sternum. Within another 24 hours the pain shifted another 2 inches towards my left armpit. Pain can be slight to intense at times requiring me to sit down.  Within 24 hours I developed a painful bump in the trapezoid about halfway between neck and shoulder.  The bump has gone down now (day 10) but the pain continues. It?s relatively constant throughout the day but gets severe enough towards the evening to stop or minimize the use of my left arm. It seems to be activity related. The more I need to do that day, the worse it is in the evening. Pain in left arm has been as expected but continues at day 10. It is slowly subsiding and is minimal compared to the other two pain locations.

He was attended to by the nurse on staff as well as myself. Reported no pain, knew his name and where he was. Stated no history of seizures and was not diabetic. Stated he has not eaten today, only a Starbucks. We got him up to a chair after a few minutes and attempted to take his blood pressure. He passed out a second time and we got him to the floor. He was alert shortly after getting him to a laying position. Ambulance was called and he was taken to be checked out.  Patient did return the next day to thank us and let us know he had a CT and labs done. His physician thought it was a vasovagal episode. He is to follow up with his primary physician soon.

                                                I received my first Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine shot on March 5, 2021, and my second shot on March 26, 2021.   After my first shot, I had minor chills, no fever, and was a little tired for two days.  However, approximately 12 hours after my second shot, I had a 101.0 F fever, with a heart rate of 105.  I did not take any fever reducing medicine.  I had a fever for two days, and slight elevation in my temperature on the third day.  My heart rate decreased over the second and third day, and went back to my normal 50s-60, four days after my second shot.  I had slight nausea the first day, and a loss of appetite two additional days.  My appetite is now back to normal.  Furthermore, I had a lot of soreness in my lower back, neck, shoulders, and knees that lasted 5 or 6 days after my second shot.  Also, I had a low-level intermittent headache the first day after the second shot.  In addition, I had significant chills that lasted 10 days after the second shot.  My chief complaint is feeling very lightheaded / unsteady when in a standing position.   Also, my exercise routine has suffered the past month.  I only walk 15 to 20 minutes and feel very tired.  Certainly, not a normal feeling for me.  I feel very tired over the past month and a half since my second shot. I have checked my EKG a few times over the past 6 weeks.  It is my normal EKG, (RBBB and LAFB) and remains unchanged.

I had been doing fine that week until the day after the second shot. I had severe shortness of breath, bad enough to keep me home and using my rescue inhaler several times that next day. This also occured when I had Covid in November 2020. It took me longer to test negative, 3 weeks. I believe that the shot caused an immune reaction, like it should, but also triggered an asthma attack that lasted several days but progressively reduced as time went on. Last week I had dizziness and heart palpitations. I have no idea if it was the shot still or the meds for my asthma, but I thought I should include it.

They tried to give me muscle relaxants and pain meds. But It did not cure anything. I have had a low-grade temperature(usually exactly 99.5 but sometimes higher ) for 38 days and does not go away. I felt inflammation and at the hospital, they did a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and it showed 144 mg/L. I entered the hospital from 5/21/2021 till 5/25/2021. They ran many tests but found no infections. They did possibly find some preexisting condition that I might have had all along.  The only problem I have is I was completely healthy per se (even with the preexisting condition that I didn?t know about) right before the vaccine I was able to exercise, able to lift weights, good energy level, and eating properly. I feel like the vaccine is still somehow working in my body even that is not supposed to be the case. I feel like my body is still in a state of hyper inflammation and it killing me.

                                                allergic reaction to the Covid 19 vaccine; nerves in his right wrist are bothering him, feels the nerves moving up and down and his arms, and feeling like the nerves in his right arm were jumping; right hand won&#39;t relax, can&#39;t bend the fingers on his right hand, can&#39;t make a fist with his right hand; like he has no control of his arm; right wrist feels like needles and pins; right hand blew up with inflammation; His fingers on his right hand were swollen, right hand looked like it was going to explode; Like his right arm was agitated, right arm was still very uncomfortable; pain in his hand; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 52-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0164), at the age of 51 years old, in right arm at single dose on 23Apr2021 16:30 for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, seasonal allergy and covid-19 in May2020. The patient reported he had symptoms of the covid-19 virus in May2020. He had a positive covid-19 virus test and did quarantine. The patient reported he&#39;s never been allergic to any kind of medication. Concomitant medications included atenolol 50-25 mg at one tablet a day. The patient didn&#39;t know the name of the other medication combined with the atenolol. The patient reported one was for the heart and one was for the blood. He also took medication for seasonal allergies but declined to provide the name. The patient previously received a flu vaccine (NDC/Lot/Expiry: unknown) on 2020 that made him feel bad with a head cold. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EP7534), at the age of 51 years old, in right arm at single dose on 02Apr2021 16:30 for covid-19 immunization. The patient started having some problems maybe a week after that. He started feeling like the nerves in his right arm were jumping. Like his right arm was agitated. His finger on his right hand were swollen. The patient did get his vaccine in the right arm. He thought his arm was going to bother him after he got the vaccine. The nerves in his right wrist are bothering him. Like he felt the nerves moving up and down and his arms, like he had no control of his arm. His right hand blew up with inflammation. His right hand looked like it was going to explode. His right hand won&#39;t relax. On 01May2021 was when he noticed his arm acting funny. He would say that the swelling had gone down from taking the antibiotics but his right arm was still very uncomfortable and he couldn&#39;t bend the fingers on his right hand and he couldn&#39;t make a fist with his right hand. His right wrist felt like needle and pins. The patient went to the emergency room at a hospital two nights in a row on 04May2021 and 05May2021. The first time he had x-rays done. The second time he had x-rays and a sonogram of his right arm to check for blood clots and he had some blood work done. All of that came back negative. The emergency room doctor asked him what arm did receive BNT162B2 in, he told the doctor his right arm, the doctor told him he&#39;s having an allergic reaction to BNT162B2. The emergency room doctor prescribed him an antibiotic to take. He&#39;d already finished the antibiotic and didn&#39;t recall the name, the bottle had been thrown away. The patient followed up with his primary care doctor on 13May2021 and was given a prescription for a muscle relaxer and motrin 600 mg to help bring the swelling and pain down in his hand. In the emergency department he had a right arm and right wrist x-ray. The doctor was trying to figure out why his right hand looked like a balloon. The only conclusion the emergency room doctor came up with was that he was having a reaction to BNT162B2. The outcome of events nerve in wrist bothering, felt nerve moving, feeling nerves jumping, right arm agitated, no control of arm, right hand won&#39;t relax and couldn&#39;t bend fingers was not recovered. The outcome of events hand blew up with inflammation, fingers on right hand swollen, right hand explode and pain in hand was recovering. The outcome of events wrist felt like needles and pins and allergic reaction to vaccine was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                On 5/20/21 the patient was at home with his mother when he had acute nausea, light-headedness, and abdominal pain. He presented to the ED by ambulance. Excerpt from ED notes od MD follows: &#34;Initial ED interventions: iv fluids, low dose iv ativan, iv toradol, iv zofran.  ED course: patient arrives very anxious, writhing on bed, difficult to redirect. With chronic tonicity, not seizing. Mother arrives, and he recognizes her, seems to be consoled somewhat by her presence, but she is unable to direct him, and describes his behavior as irregular, and events acute this evening at her home.  Patient rests, and then HR decrease to 50s on monitior and patient found to be pulseless - I immediately start chest compressions, and achieve ROSC after PEA arrest with administration of EPI/compressions. Patient intubated per procedure note without complication. L femoral central attained per procedure note without complication. CPR performed over ED course intermittently (always PEA arrest) with ROSC achieved with administration of EPI, EPI drip started in addition to sedation meds, and iv fluids. No obvious STEMI on ECG to administer lytics, with suspicion of dissection and AAA prominent. I am able to stabilze and accompany patient to CT suite, where I recognize B/L massive PE immediately. I discuss with Dr. of Cardiology, who agrees with admininstration of alteplase. I disucss risks with mother who consents verbally. Patient without response to alteplase, and with continued pattern of PEA arrest following bradycardia. I discuss etiology of presentation with mother,and that patient is with very poor prognosis of survival, and likely poorer prognosis of neurological status, and patient is made comfort care, and fentanyl drip increased, patient is taken off of ventilation and drips. Pronounced deceased at 22:00.  MDM: Initial concern for but not limited to appendicitis, AAA, diverticulitis, renal stones, pyelonephritis, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis, toxic ingestion, ACS, obstruction, perforation, sepsis (2/2 PNA, UTI, meningitis, intra-abdominal infection), AAA, dissection, PE - as ED course progresses, differential narrows and consider more likely PEA arrest secondary to ACS, PE, dissection, AAA, necrotic pancreatitis, tension PNX (less likely). Considered but do not suspect seizures, stroke. Imaging studies reviewed - CXR with ETT in place, no acute pathology. CTA chest/A/P remarkable for massive proximal B/L PE. Labs reviewed. ECGs without STEMI, with sinus tach initially, LBBB after initial ROSC, and then AFib in RVR on subsequent ECG. Per above, patient suffered massive B/L PE, with subsequent cardiac arrest, despite heoric efforts including thrombolysis. Death called art 22:00.  Diagnosis: massive B/L PEs, PEA arrest.  Disposition: deceased.&#34;

A 51-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 04May2021 (at age of 51 years old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included flu, has gotten the flu before but has never gone on this long.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Clinical course as reported: He is a practicing physician who has been providing vaccinations to patients all of his life.  He ended up with severe right deltoid pain. It is usually not a problem, he has dealt with this with other shots.  By the second or third day, it was very tender and swollen and had axillary lymphadenopathy on the same side he re-ceived the vaccination. It persisted the next day until day 5 or 6. He then started to get worried.  He went to the hospital. They did a CT scan which noted there was notable lymphadenopathy. They thought it was a reaction to the Covid vaccination.  2 days later, he went home and he kept taking Motrin and Tylenol on board. Lymphadenopathy was evident in the left axilla, inguinal nodes, and is still there now. On day 7, he went into full blown flu syndrome, had a headache, body aches and flu like chills, the whole thing. Is still a little bit rhinitic and is very congested, and is draining like a faucet. It has all been happening since he got vaccinated. He was told he was either exposed to covid or it is from the vaccination. He went to urgent care yesterday (20May2021) and they did a Covid test which was negative.  He hates to point fingers but this fatigue has been overwhelming and is never ending.  He called withheld where he got the vaccination. He said the pharmacist has been hearing this from a lot of patients.  He reported for 7 days straight the clinical events as they were happening. Nobody has contacted him, they said some-one would be contacting him the next day and he has not heard from anyone.  This laid him up for 5 days. The last 4 days, he had severe pain in the left foot, and the right hand. It was out of the blue like someone whacked him with a hammer. He couldn&#39;t even walk, it was completely painful.  He hasn&#39;t worked out since he got the damn shot. In 15 days, he has not gone to the gym.  They did an X-ray which didn&#39;t say anything. He was in immense pain. They gave him prescription for Prednisone 50mg and he hasn&#39;t been able to get to the pharmacy to get it yet but will head over shortly.  Has been taking Motrin and Tylenol around the clock. Has been taking antihistamines because his nose has been running like a faucet non stop and he has a sore throat. Sore throat has gotten better in the last 5 days. The pain was really bad. The sore throat has subsided. The  nasal drain-age and his eyes are watery are still there. Has been fatigued and his body aches and he is exhausted.  The second vaccination is due 25May2021 and he is absolutely not getting the second one.  When having other viral syndromes, he has never felt this sick. Has gotten the flu before but has never gone on this long.  He is just feeling like crap. Can barely even get out of bed every morning. It is unbelievable. He hasn&#39;t had any true positive exposure. Has not been exposed to other family members with Covid/ coronavirus.  Have practices strict isolation in their home. They have 5 kids and they did not go near anyone or go to any public places.  For this to happen, it has to be because of the vaccine. Nothing else could have caused this. No one else around him has been sick. Is not sure if they are getting a lot of reports.  When going on line to the Pfizer vaccine reporting, it took him a while to get a number to contact Pfizer directly. He called (Withheld) and they gave him 2 wrong numbers. It took 4 people to get the number to report this to Pfizer. He thinks there is a lot of under reporting.  If he has a deductible, he would like Pfizer to take care of the cost for his ER visit. On 21May2021,  reported that Beginning 05/04 when received vaccine, experienced Very large lymph nodes and Flu syndrome. Outcome for events sore throat was recovered on May2021, for other events was unknown.    The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

Range of motion of the right arm in particular is limited significantly die to pain.  There is dull to throbbing pain during certain times of the day even when arms are not being used.

                                                I had the Pfizer vaccine on Friday, March 21st. An hour after getting the vaccine I could not walk. I could move my feet and legs but couldn?t walk until the next day.  In addition I could understand what people were asking me but couldn?t find the words to answer their questions properly.

                                                I got my first Pfizer vaccine injection on 3/23/2021 and felt no immediate side effects, but almost exactly 1 week later I noticed slight dizziness. Yesterday it was more apparent and today I woke up with it worse. It worried me and I found myself a bit panicky and my heart was racing. When I calm down, heart rate is fine.    It&#39;s more noticeable today. Not to the point of nausea, nor full vertigo, but I feel kinda foggy and unsure about my balance

He is calling because he experienced lymphadenopathy- explains he experienced Lymph node pain/tenderness around his left clavicle. Caller clarified that the injection was on his left side. The pain/tenderness occurred the next day, 27Feb2021 and it was self limiting and it lasted about 5-7 days. He didn&#39;t think anything of it, everything else was ok, the arm pain resolved after one day. On 12Mar2021, he developed similar pain on the right side, but it was a more intense pain/tenderness and lasted maybe 4 days. He still experiences it, but less frequently. He is not sure if he is describing it correctly. During the afternoon, it gets a bit more tender. He doesn&#39;t feel it in the morning, but by the afternoon he notices the pain/tenderness. He did not know if there were any reports of contralateral lymphadenopathy (lymph node pain). He clarified that there is no redness or lump- he doesn&#39;t feel anything, even if he touches it there&#39;s no pain, but periodically there will be a shooting tenderness. He feels like it&#39;s getting better, but it is still persisting. He clarified that on the right side- he is experiencing pain near the axilla, underneath the arm next to the chest. He is waiting to see if it is improving and doesn&#39;t know how long he should wait. He stated that it wasn&#39;t that painful on the left side, it was just a little tender; he knew something was different. The pain wasn&#39;t always there. Sometimes there&#39;s a little pain on the left side still, but not as intense as the right side. The pain is there, it&#39;s not worsening but it is not improving. The patient also reports joint stiffness around neck and shoulder and describes discomfort as ongoing intermittent tenderness.

                                                I received my second COVID vaccination in the afternoon and started to experience side effects from the shot around 1:00 in the morning.  When I woke up to go to the bathroom at 4:30 in the morning I was not feeling well in my stomach and I felt a little dizzy.  On my way back to bed from the bathroom I fainted and fell face first into the wall heater and then to to the floor.  This action fractured my nose and gave me multiple bruises and cuts in my face and upper body.

                                                Upper arm soreness started at about 8:30 pm, about 10 h after injection. Went to be like normal and arm was just sore, but nothing else at that time. At 1:10 am, patient woke up with horrible shakes, verging on convulsions, and the feeling of freezing to death. Uncontrollable shivers/shaking.  At around 1:40 am, patient was able to move enough to get out of bed to find a second blanket and extra strength Tylenol and took the Tylenol with some seltzer water and hid under blankets to get warmer. After about an hour, around 2:30 - 2:40 am, the shaking was reduced enough that the patient was able to relax and try to get to sleep. At 5;30 am, the patient woke up with much the same symptoms, but with the addition of the worst headache he had had since he stopped having migraines in his mid 20s and also his whole body ached like he had been hit by a truck (that [getting hit by a truck] had happened to him once about 15 years ago, so he has the actual reference to compare against).  This experience was worst overall body aches/pains ever experienced by the patient. He took additional Tylenol at 6 am and about 30 minutes later, the chills subsided and the pain was reduced enough that he could go to sleep again. Shortly before 10 am the symptoms started to get worse again and he took ibuprofen (400 mg) at 10 am, after the shakes started to come back. He has traded off every 4 hours taking tylenol and ibuprofen, which keeps the temperature perception swings to a minimum and overall body aches lower, but the headache does not go away. He feels exhausted, and has slept for spurts of 15 - 30 minutes on and off all day.  He was able to each crackers at around noon and some homemade chicken vegetable soup at about 1 pm as the nausea had subsided. Prior to that, he could only drink water and Gatorade. He is hoping that within 24 - 48 h he will feel much better, without having to take Tylenol or Ibuprofen.

                                                He got his vaccine, he felt fine after it for the rest of the day.  The next morning he woke up with dizziness, headache and vision/near sighedness was impaired.  He has some emotional issues that have been corrected but they seemed to have returned.  Also had fatigue that was fairly  mild at first, and over the next 3 days got worse, and has remained the same since that time to present.   About a week some of the dizziness and headaches are not as often, but the headaches have become more severe.  Before it was a low grade migraine that was constant, but other times it is horrific and others not too bad.  No predictability.  No fever, no chills, no sore injection site.  He has notified his doctor who tested his electrolytes which came back normal.  He ended up falling getting out of the shower and hurt his back and shoulder and prescribed him Hydrocodone which did not help the headache.

A 52-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0173 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 08May2021 at 02:38 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included Bug bite (happened 5 days prior to 30Apr2021 and regimen of an antibiotic). He was completely done with the rotation for a least 8 days before he got the vaccine. It might have something to do with this. concomitant medication included dicloxacillin (started it on 30Apr2021 and it was for 5 days. He did not know what it did was). The patient reported that on 08May2021, day one, he experienced, tiredness and injection site pain. On day 2, until now side effects which had not gone away. It hadn&#39;t gotten worse, but it was not any better. The patient felt like congestion, but his nose was bone dry, like crusty dry. It hurts a little bit because it was so dry and he had arm soreness, nothing out of the ordinary. The arm soreness was just normal injection stuff. At first it was a little tender on the injection spot. It went away after about a day. On 10May2021, the patient felt like there were little, tiny baby hands pinching his internal organs randomly throughout his abdomen. It was not a sharp pain, more like a little squeeze all through his abdomen. It felt like his whole throat was swollen. It was not visually swollen, it more felt like a football in his neck. Stretching it was helping. His toes have been locking up like a pre-clamping. He had numbness from his ankles to his feet for 8 days, and now he has numbness from his knees to his feet. It was not completely numb, but it was not normal. The feeling of baby hands pinching his internal organs started the second day after the vaccine and has stayed consistent. The patient&#39;s eyes swollen, and his vision was diminished. Day 2 through today, it felt like his eyes were swollen, his vision was seriously diminished, he had a golf ball sized welt on his arm not at the injection site but 2 inches from it, and he was really dizzy and really lightheaded and almost fainted at the corner store. The feeling like his eyes were swollen started on day 3 after the vaccine. The crease of his eye be-low the eyebrow and on top of the socket got red and puffy and looked like sunburnt skin does. It was at the point that now it feels swollen all the time almost like he had pink eye and his vision has been diminished about 30%. He had a test done yesterday and his vision was 20/25. Some-times he could not even read a text and had to stare at his phone for 10 minutes to make out words. He did not have these issues before. The feeling of his eyes being swollen was a little better in the mornings and about 1300 it gets worse when he gets lightheaded to where was when it started. His vision became diminished about day 3 after the vaccine. It was a little better in the morning, but in the afternoon, it goes to exactly the same as when it started. He noticed the golf ball sized welt on his arm about 3 days ago. The doctor seemed to think a drop of the injection might had travelled from the injection site and his body was creating a defense to it. It was scary to take a shower and then see that. It didn&#39;t hurt. It was not painful, but it was a weird foreign entity. The cramping in his toes started probably day 3 and was consistent. The numbness started on day 2 after the vaccine, and up until 3 days ago it was just his ankles and feet. 3 days ago, it got to the point where it was from his knees to his feet. It has gotten worse since it was now travelling up his legs. On his injection arm- 2 inches away from the injection site appeared a size of a gigantic golf ball - when asked with his doctor he said that he thinks that a drop of the vaccine travelled and his body building a reaction to it and it was very abnormal. The patient also had numbness from his ankle to his feet worsened and from his knees to his feet- almost feels like it was cold and tingly. The patient also had dizziness and lightheaded about day 2 after the vaccine and it was the same. It came in waves but was consistent throughout the day. He would be fine then had a wave of dizziness. He has been laying down so much because he was so tired, ringing ears, felt like his glands were swollen, pressure in his neck to his injection site, and back pains. The patient stated that his doctor was only form urgent care. The patient Felt like whole throat was swollen, toes locking up, really lightheaded, mind has been foggy, and arm soreness. The patient had bizarre side effects from the Covid Vaccine for 11 days now. He thought it was the smart thing to report them to Pfizer. He didn&#39;t like to give personal information. He declined to give his mailing address or his email address. He hated when asked for race, but he guessed it might be important. He did not have a mailing address, phone number, or email address handy for his physician. He went to Urgent Care yesterday to have it checked and they did an EKG and said he had to be sent by ambulance to the ER. The doctor did bloodwork, and she said everything looked alright and to rest a few more days and keep hydrated. The patient underwent the lab work and procedures which included chest X-ray with unspecified result. He thinks it was on 18May2021. His mind has been foggy with all of that. It was yesterday or the day before. He could not be sure. He has been sleeping so much and was in a complete daze. The fogginess he had the whole time as his other symptoms, and it was the same. He has been eating well and hydrating and taking a multivitamin and Gatorade, all the things&#39; people say to do. He asked if Pfizer has heard of this before. He was panicked it might be chronic, and he worries about the safety of the second shot for him. He was sure many people haven&#39;t reacted, but these are freaky side effects. He asked for advice and if Pfizer had heard of this before or if he was some weird anomaly. On his way to get the vaccine he asked 2 people at the city health line if they had taken it and they both said no. He asked 3 other patients and they said they took the Pfizer. One woman said she will take it when they make her. The guy who gave him the shot lied and said he wasn&#39;t eligible. It might have been his way of not having to discuss it. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior vaccination. The patient was tested for Covid post vaccination with Nasal Swab on 18May2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Device Date: 23May2021,Additional information has been requested.

                                                dizziness; nausea; He did not feel well at all and was not able to feel well enough to stand up.; definite lack of coordination; he vomited on himself; his cholesterol was high at 208.; had very little strength; started feeling like something was wrong; just had sort of a feeling like being really drunk; passed out (fainted) in his car 3 times; He was told he had a vasovagal reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 52-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 15May2021 10:50 (Lot Number: EW0173; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included vasovagal reactions in high school. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Within 2 minutes of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine he started feeling like something was wrong. He pulled to the side in the parking garage and as soon as he stopped the car he passed out. He woke back up and was able to put the car in park and he passed out a second time. He woke up again and his foot was on the gas pedal and he tried to roll down the window. He was able to roll down the window but he wasn&#39;t able to get anyone&#39;s attention. He passed out a third time. When he woke up again he wasn&#39;t able to get the door open and he was nauseated. He basically had nausea, dizziness, and a definite lack of coordination. He just had sort of a feeling like being really drunk. He doesn&#39;t drink. He had very little strength but he was able to push his car horn. He was out of it. He could see someone in his car mirror a little ways behind his car and the horn didn&#39;t get the person&#39;s attention so he honked a second time and someone came to help him, maybe from the fire department and maybe some emergency medical technicians. He was placed on a golf cart or ATV to be transported downstairs to a waiting ambulance and while on the ride he vomited himself. He mentioned that the EMTs called it a vasovagal reaction. He was brought to the hospital in which he had a lot of tests done. He did not feel well at all and was not able to feel well enough to stand up. He had tests done at the hospital, a chest x-ray and his blood was drawn. He had a cardiac ultrasound later in the afternoon the next day on 16May2021. The doctor&#39;s didn&#39;t find anything wrong other than his cholesterol was high at 208. He was admitted to the hospital on 15May2021. He continued to have his blood drawn through the night and the next morning, on 16May2021, he had a CAT scan. For his cholesterol he was told to eat better and maybe follow up with a doctor in a couple months to check his cholesterol again. No one had any answers to the effect of what happened to him. Everything was fine, his tests were normal. He was told he had a vasovagal reaction. He&#39;s had vasovagal reactions before and he can tell this was much different than the vasovagal reactions he&#39;s had before. In the past when he&#39;s had vasovagal reactions the world went black like looking through a small circle, his vision got blacker and blacker and then he&#39;d pass out. He did not have this feeling with the Covid 19 vaccine. He can only describe this feeling that he had like an occasion in his past when he&#39;s drank to much and he&#39;s stumbling around. He may have passed out briefly to someone helping him move to a bed and his arms are weighted and he can&#39;t lift them and he&#39;s disoriented but still has a sense of what&#39;s going on but he feels like he could vomit at any second. He&#39;s comparing his experience to the Covid 19 vaccine to drinking to much alcohol and then falling asleep or passing out. He was pretty much out of it for 5 hours. Between the fourth and fifth hours after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine he was comfortable enough to stand on his own for brief moments. He was feeling better and was able to use the restroom. By the next day, around the 24 hour period after the vaccine he was feeling almost normal. He was released from the hospital the next day, 16May2021 at around 4:00PM. He was maybe in the hospital for about 27 to 28 hours. At the hospital he had all these tests and he was found to be healthy with no problems. He also had a Covid 19 virus test, he never asked what the results were but he&#39;s going under the assumption that if he was Covid 19 virus positive the hospital staff would have told him. Passing out, nausea, dizziness required a visit to Emergency Room. The outcome was unknown.

                                                After 2nd shot, I began having a noise in my left ear, for 3 day&#39;s it would come and go, on the 4th day it just stayed on and has been making the noise in my ear at all times. Once or twice a day when I stand up I get dizzy or wobbly feeling, sometimes it is bad enough I have to sit back down. I no longer sleep well. I used to just lay in one spot all night, barely making a dent in the covers. My dog slept in bed every night for over 7 years. But after vax, she stopped sleeping on bed and I wake up to a trashed bed and the covers all balled up on my head. How or what I eat has changed, I no longer like most of the stuff I always liked. I no longer feel right, just always feel off, tired and by the end of most days the noise in my ear is driving me insane. I have never experienced the ear noise or the getting dizzy ever in my entire life until the Govt stuck poison in my arm.

                                                Two days after the second dose, started to experience headaches, lightheadedness and nausea pretty much constant for the next 6 weeks.  Went to primary care physician the 2nd week and he thought it was vaccine related.  One week later it had got worse so went back to other primary care physician in the same office who thought I had vertigo and an ear infection.  I then followed up with an ENT who said I did not have an ear infection but thought my symptoms were vaccine related and stated she had seen multiple other patients with same symptoms.    At one point the headache and nausea was so bad I went to an urgent care clinic who did a CT scan thinking it might be a stroke but later ruled that out.   the initial primary care physician had ordered some blood tests which then prompted a referral to a hematologist/Oncologist who did more testing and concluded that thought my issues were vaccine related.

Lasted 90-120 minutes before going to sleep, then gone by morning.

By afternoon of 12 JAN 21 experienced sudden onset loss of bladder control for first time in his life, followed a few hours later by blurry vision, vertigo, motion sickness, emesis and cold sweats that drenched his clothes. Taken to  ER by paramedics, and admitted  for further observation and evaluation for underlying neurologic vs. cardiogenic problems. Given positional treatments by PT for possible otoliths.  Feels much improved on afternoon of 13 JAN 21, but symptoms not fully resolved. Will likely be discharged from hospital on 14 JAN 21 if problems continue to resolve.

About 10 minutes later, as I was driving home, I had an odd taste in my mouth and my right cheek started to go numb.  I arrived home and started looking for answers (Pfizer information page that lists side effects).  The sensation lasted about an hour or so, then started to subside.  By the time I went to bed, there was just a little tingle at the edge of my cheek bone. Other than being tired and a bit woozy, I feel better today.

                                                Following vaccination, patient felt achy and mildly feverish. During the night, he got up to use the restroom and felt palpitations and lightheadedness, which persisted during the morning. A colleague at work evaluated the patient&#39;s pulse, noting it to be irregular and fast, so patient went to the ED for evaluation. EKG was performed and patient was found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation. Patient was given fluid boluses, 10mg IV diltiazem, and a diltiazem infusion, during which the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm. After stabilization, he was discharged with new prescriptions for metoprolol tartrate 25mg BID and apixaban 5mg BID, to follow up with cardiology.

He said the pain from the shot in his arm had traveled to his neck.At around 11:45 pm he got out of bed and became FREEZING, started shaking, teeth chattering, fever of 101. I gave him Tylenol pm to halt the fever. He was up all night shaking, teeth chattering, burning with fever. This morning the fever is 100. He had Covid over Thanksgiving which started the same way. He went to the ER with Covid and could not get out of bed for ten days.  No additional medical treatment at this time

I told the Dr there , they released me after 20 min , as there was no serious pain . After couple of days with Sore Arm pain , my left ribs area became a little sore and starting to have what felt like nerve jolts from left side of my Neck down my left arm.   The Neck pain and nerve feeling got steadily worse over the next 3-4 days , on the 5th or 6th day the pain was so bad I could not move out of bed in the morning for over 2.5 hours.   With a sudden move there was lightening bolt type pain shooting down left arm and right leg.  Pain subsided over the next 3-4 days.  I would say now it&#39;s 90% .

Then that night I woke up at 2:30 AM with severe pain in my right knee.  I was unable to bend the knee or walk for the next 36 hours.  After that the pain transitioned to the back of my calf muscle for the next few days.  The pain then went back to my knee for a day and then returned to the back of my calf muscle.  On 3/30/21 I saw my primary care physician who then sent me to get an ultrasound which determined that the pain in my knee and calf were caused by blood clots (DVT).  I was then prescribed Eliquis 5 mg blood thinners.

When he came home he complained of numbness and loss of strength in his left arm and as the next hour progressed he began experiencing numbness in his left hip and decreasing strength in his left hand. I called a medical professional who told me to take him to call an ambulance or take him to the nearest hospital. We arrived at the hospital at 2:30pm and symptoms persisted. By the time we arrived his blood pressure had jumped to 185/114  (This morning before the shot he had self monitored his BP @ 128/80)

                                                A week later I am driving  on the highway and I started to feel shortness of breath, within 2-3 minutes I got out via an exit and park at a gas station, I palpated my chest and felt a weak but rapid heart beat. I ingested the carvedilol 6.25mg, I felt dizzy but walked in the gas station to got a granola bar and chocolate milk drink went back to the car. Twenty five minutes after taking the first carvedilol, I felt no changes in heart rate &amp; shortness of breath and took an additional 6.25mg of carvedilol. I then called my wife and talk to her (and my children) about what was happening and where I was. I asked to call 911 if I loose consciousness. At about fity five-Sixty minutes went by and symptoms were unchanged  and I took third dose of 6.25 mg of cavedilol. At approximately 75-80 minutes after onset of symptoms my hear rate went down and shortness of breath improved to normal. I contacted my doctor the next day

A 53-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left (left shoulder) on 30Mar2021 09:00 (Lot Number: ER8733) at age of 53 years old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. Family medical history relevant to events: caller states he don&#39;t think so, his father had high blood pressure and diabetes. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen taken for tooth disorder at 600 mg every 8-12 hours, taking it probably a week before receiving the vaccine. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No events following prior vaccinations. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient experienced slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at on 30Mar2021, chills on 02Apr2021, fever on 02Apr2021, sweating on 02Apr2021, continued muscle pain on 03Apr2021, skin, hair was hurting, couldn&#39;t touch skin on 03Apr2021, muscular pain down to pelvis and knees aching on 03Apr2021, diarrhea on 03Apr2021, fatigue in 2021, headache in 2021, weakness and dizziness in 2021, sinus drainage in 2021, feels dehydrated in 2021.  The patient was calling to report some long term, severe side effects. He received the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He didn&#39;t have anything then muscle pain for the first two and a half days, no reaction until on Friday 02Apr2021 he had extreme chills, fever, sweating, then that continued on to be muscle pain, his skin and hair were hurting, couldn&#39;t touch skin through Sunday 04Apr2021. It dissipated into muscular and inner-skeletal pain. He had muscular pain down to pelvis and knees and things would start aching.  Now it was kind of letting up. It was the 4th day now and no one he knows who had gotten it had such a long term reaction to this. Clarified that he had slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at and that dissipated on Thursday 01Apr2021 and he had no pain anymore and no other side effects. On Friday 02Apr2021 afternoon when it went haywire and thought he may have to go to the hospital on Sunday 04Apr2021. He had diarrhea and almost had everything on the list except redness at the site injection. He also did not have swollen lymph nodes. He didn&#39;t think he needed to go to the hospital, he normally didn&#39;t get sick and hadn&#39;t been ill for years and this was why he wanted to report it because it seemed that it was pulling for along time. He had been sleeping and drinking a lot of liquids. Headache, joint pain, and diarrhea continued all the way through Monday 05Apr2021 and started to dissipate Monday evening. He had no nausea and vomiting. The muscular pain down to pelvis started Saturday 03Apr2021. His knee would ache and then that would stop and then his other knee would ache then stop. It was like it would transfer around lower part of body, and that dissipated late Monday 05Apr2021 night into Tuesday (06Apr2021). Now he had fatigue was tired and had sinus drainage. He felt dehydrated and couldn&#39;t seem to drink enough liquids to get the feeling of dry mouth out.  The diarrhea, fatigue and the sinus drainage was still continuing and the other symptoms seem to have dissipated. He still felt so fatigued and didn&#39;t feel the other symptoms are there. He hoped they didn&#39;t return. It had stayed the same for the diarrhea, fatigue and sinus drainage and he was still tired. Later added he did have weakness and dizziness, but assumed it was fever and chills. Caller states he did have weakness and dizziness and Saturday 03Apr2021 and Sunday 04Apr2021 were the worst two for all of the symptoms at the same time. It had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021 evening. Outcome of weakness and dizziness: Caller initially confirmed it had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021. However, he later stated he was still experiencing slightness there. He still feels some weakness, and feels about 60% right now.  He thought it would be a good idea to get vaccinated because he had family members that had contracted covid-19 and be less weary of the virus. He was hesitant now to get the second shot. He was taking ibuprofen because he had issues with a tooth. He was taking Benadryl for the sinus and hadn&#39;t taken it in 36 hours and hadn&#39;t taking anything else. He was already taking Ibuprofen for the tooth issue, but was also using it to relieve some of the symptoms and if it was indeed that he may have contracted something after that. He hadn&#39;t been to the doctor but for checks ups in years and years.  Time of Onset (24-hour clock): Caller stated it started about 1-2 pm in the afternoon on Friday 02Apr2021 and came on very quickly. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of diarrhea, fatigue, sinus drainage was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Blood clots in right leg below knee; he passed out from pain; pain in his right knee; he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all; knee was swollen; couldn&#39;t walk/limping around; his knee more stiff; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 53-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 21Mar2021 at 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing Factor V Leiden heterozygous, allergies to mushrooms from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and a torn meniscus in his right knee and he had surgery 3 to 4 years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Cephalexin and Percocet and experienced allergies. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested post vaccination. On 22Mar2021 at night around 2:30AM, the patient woke up and started walking to the bathroom and he passed out from pain. He had pain in his right knee. He thought he had torn his knee again. He had surgery 3 or 4 years ago for a torn meniscus in his right knee and he thought he had torn his meniscus again. He passed out, his wife found him and he went back to bed. In the morning, his knee was still very very sore, he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all. He took an Advil between 6:30AM and 8:00AM. He hadn&#39;t taken any medications prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. His knee was swollen but the pain was manageable. He couldn&#39;t walk, he was on crutches for about 24 hours then the swelling started coming down and he put a brace on his knee. He could then walk without the crutches but it was still painful. The next day he had pain in the back of his knee. He thought the pain was caused because he had put the brace on and had been using the crutches. Like he had made his knee more stiff from not using it. He was limping around and the pain was bearable. At that point, the pain was maybe a 4 on a scale of 1-10 where his pain had been a 9 on a scale of 1-10. He took another Advil and he realized the pain in the back of his knee wasn&#39;t going away. He went to see his family doctor and his doctor was able to get him in that same day for an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed 2 blood clots behind his right knee. The patient had blood clots in right leg below knee. The week of the report, he got an appointment with a hematologist. The hematologist reviewed his case and the doctor isn&#39;t 100% sure the blood clots were from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine but the doctor isn&#39;t ruling it out either because it happened within 24 hours of receiving his first COVID-19 dose. He hadn&#39;t done anything strenuous before getting the COVID-19 vaccine, nothing that he thinks would have caused the blood clots. He would like to add, what he thinks is relevant, is that he is positive for Factor V. He reports he has one copy and Factor V only impacts about 3% of the population. The hematologist thought that he might be prone to developing blood clots. The hematologist reports that he has had patients who have had the COVID-19 virus who have developed blood clots. Maybe it&#39;s possible that the COVID-19 antibodies were trying to build up his immune system to COVID-19 and it created something similar to having the COVID-19 virus. If he is predisposed to blood clots then the COVID-19 vaccine may have precipitated the blood clots. His second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for Sunday, 11Apr2021. He had talked to both his family doctor and his hematologist and they both thought he should be ok in getting the second COVID-19 vaccine. He was prescribed blood thinners. If the second COVID-19 vaccine caused more blood clots the blood thinners would help him. He was asking if there is any additional information or guidance on receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine after his reaction. The pharmacist told him that the COVID-19 vaccine trials were all done in the left arm. He received his vaccine in his right arm and his right knee was affected. If he gets the second COVID-19 vaccine he&#39;s getting it in his left arm. He was prescribed Eliquis 5mg take one tablet twice daily. The outcome of the event blood clots in right leg below knee was recovering while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                It appears that I obtained gout as a result of the vaccination I received on May 2nd, 2021. I have no prior history of gout. Several hours after my vaccination my big toe on my left foot began to hurt. By Monday morning, May 3rd 2021, my big toe and the area surrounding it had swollen and was very painful, making it difficult to walk. I began putting my foot in cold water as well as hot water with epsom salt.to reduce the swelling and get rid of the pain. On Tuesday morning, May 4th, 2021, my toe felt better was still painful to walk and put pressure on it. There is still swelling on my foot in the area around my big toe as well. In googling my issue and feeling that this could only be due to receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, I decided to contact a podiatrist. I scheduled an appointment to see Dr.  on Thursday, May 6th 2021 @ 11:30 a.m.

A 53-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0151) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 09Apr2021 12:30 at age of 53-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high cholesterol, anxiety disorder, known allergies: Clonazepam (KLONOPIN), food allergies: sea bass and orange roughy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; lovastatin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; ibuprofen taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, lot number EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 18Mar2021 11:00 AM at age of 53-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was currently 11 days out from receiving his second COVID vaccine and he was still having very strong side effects. This included an emergency room visit on 16Apr2021. He was generally very good health and he exercised regularly including running so these were very abnormal effects for him. Beginning one day after receiving his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19: 1. Strong chest pressure and fluctuating heartbeat. 2. Slower breathing and respiratory response. 3. Extreme fatigue &amp; very low energy (for example, walking up two flights of stairs made him very tired and spikes his heart rate, abnormal for him). 4. Loss of appetite and loss of weight. 5. Abnormally wide fluctuation of blood pressure while not exerting himself. For example, higher blood pressure readings (155/95) with a slower pulse (60) or the opposite scenario, (110/89) elevated pulse 98. 6. Difficulty relaxing and sleeping. 7. Nausea and some dizziness. 8. Stomach pain and diarrhea. 9. Headaches. 10. Low grade fever. As of 26Apr2021, it stated the day after the patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination (10Apr2021 12:00 PM), he began to have side effects which he expected to some extent. However, as of today, he has 17 days straight of side effects or perhaps an adverse event. His symptoms began mildly the day after but suddenly increased greatly within the next couple days and he had been dealing with this ever since. He had made two emergency room visits, seen his general practitioner, and as of today (26Apr2021) a cardiologist who ordered imaging. His symptoms range from, extreme fatigue, nausea, strong stomach and intestinal discomfort, weight loss, shortness of breath, sudden increased heart rates and high blood pressure readings, intense chest pressure and some pain, powerful involuntary shaking of my body that comes in waves, and pressure and pain in the back of his head at the cerebellum. His life was basically come to a screeching halt and he was searching for answers! The doctors he had spoken to were unclear as to what was wrong with him and why. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment received for the events. COVID tested post vaccination on 17Apr2021 included PCR and Nasal Swab, both showed negative result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Every joint hurt really bad (From: Apr2021 To: 18Apr2021, duration 17 days), and he couldn&#39;t walk. So, he went to the emergency room and the ER people told him he had arthritis and to go home and take Tylenol. He came home, took Tylenol, and then his chest and back started hurting. He went to the doctor and the doctor ran an arthritis test, lupus test, and all these tests, and it came back negative. The only test that came back positive was the inflammation test. He had 3 times the normal amount of inflammation a person is supposed to have. He stated his chest hurts really bad and his back hurts really bad. He keeps going to the hospital and then they keep sending him home. Caller states he is not sure if he&#39;s not going to die but all of his other items are out of whack, like his diabetes is out of whack. He can confirm after all the joint pain went away, then the chest and back pain/inflammation popped up. The chest and back pain has worsened. It&#39;s worse than yesterday. He has not taken any aspirin or anything. The back pain has worsened. It feels like he did chest exercises. It hurts to the touch. He has back inflammation.

He does not know what to do and what he can and cannot take also has diabetes and his blood sugar seems to be extremely high, which it never is. They are working on getting his blood sugar under control, but it seems like it&#39;s been out of whack for a little bit. He later clarified that he switched medications prior in March and he is on some new stuff and he expected it to be out of whack. He also adds that it&#39;s like he has a sore throat but he doesn&#39;t have a sore throat, it&#39;s like when you get a cold and it&#39;s kind of hard to swallow. He explains when arthritis issue/joint stuff cleared up, he had the sore throat, the chest pain and sore throat appeared. It&#39;s been 3 or 4 days and it has not gone away. ER Dates - 15Apr2021.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 53-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203; expiration date: Jun2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 18:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing lyme disease. There were no concomitant medications. The patient went through post- vaccination especially because he has Lyme disease. He has had this pre-existing autoimmune disease for 8, almost 9 years, he wants to add this information to the database. Caller states the first shot he would say was kind of catastrophic, the second shot, he will go into. Caller states the second shot, he showed up at the military vaccination place locally and they actually declined his ability to get it with them because of his first reaction even though he had the go ahead from his Lyme specialist and primary doctors. Caller states because of this, he went after four weeks instead of three and he went to a high risk clinic to protect him from anaphylaxis. He has received both doses, the first dose was horrendous and the second was quite easy. Caller states no reaction whatsoever with the second, though he still has remaining symptoms. Reporter Details: Caller states his legal name is (Name), he goes by (Name). Caller states he would prefer if company contacted him and also so that maybe they can warn people with autoimmune or Lyme that the first one is going to be kind of rough. Caller states he works with the public. Prescribing Healthcare Professional: Caller states unsure of email address. Caller states the only thing missing off the initial story is that all in all, the second shot was really good. Caller states he does have some very lingering issues still that he is going to be seeing the Lyme specialist about. Caller states the first dose, it&#39;s pretty intense. Caller states the second one, he had fatigue and neuropathy from the stupid autoimmune stuff. Caller states there is residual symptoms, but nothing like the initial ones. Caller states what he did was he just jotted some notes down about every third or fourth day up until the second shot just to detail each symptom. Caller states he only wrote about 5 days worth of little sentences. Caller states 27Feb2021, the first dose, it was a Saturday so by Monday 29Feb2021, it started with itching, burning rashes, so like a visible rash on his chest with raised bumps, neuropathy- shooting pains in his fingers and toes that feels like bugs are crawling all over him, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. Caller verifies all of these symptoms actually began on 01Mar2021. Itching, burning rashes: Caller states he would say they lasted about 2-3 weeks because he went to the walk-in to have them check and called his primary doctor and went into his primary and had him check. Caller states it ended sometime in Mar2021 and he has recovered completely. Neuropathy: Shooting pains in his fingers and toes: Caller verifies it began 01Mar2021. Caller states he would say he still has about 20% left. Caller states it is hard to sleep at night because he still gets itching and burning and stuff. Caller states it is persisting, but certainly not as bad. Headache: Caller verifies it started 01Mar2021. Caller states it ended Mar2021 and has recovered completely. Fatigue: Caller states began 01Mar2021. Caller states this is one of the bad ones he would say. Caller states he still, he would like to go for a walk or work out and he barely has the amount of energy to work let alone the others. Caller states he can&#39;t workout or walk. Caller states if he goes up and down stairs, he&#39;s exhausted. Caller states that&#39;s definitely a lasting one. Caller verifies it is ongoing, persisting. Dizziness: Caller verifies it began on 01Mar2021 and is ongoing. Caller states when he walks he literally cannot turn his head quickly or he feels like he&#39;s going to throw up or pass out. Caller verifies it is persisting. Caller states he would say about 4 or 5 days later from getting the first shot, this was really interestingly weird, he had mouth sores that wouldn&#39;t heal and debilitating malaise and fatigue. Caller states malaise so bad he couldn&#39;t get through work, he could barely work. Caller states the mouth sores were so weird. Caller states everything he is telling company he has read about online. Caller states he has had canker sores from low immunity, but this was on the tip of his tongue, either side of the tongue tip, it came and went three or four times through the entire month. Caller states it was like his immune system was on the edge of crashing, then he would sleep a lot more. Caller states he would do whatever he could do to make it come back. Caller verifies this debilitating fatigue is different than overall fatigue that began 01Mar2021. Caller states the debilitating malaise began 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. Debilitating Fatigue; Debilitating Malaise: Caller states the debilitating fatigue also began 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. Caller states it is acute. Caller states ended sometime in Mar2021. Caller states recovered completely but is still left with some fatigue. Caller states recovered with lasting effects maybe. Caller says the other one, he could barely get up, he could barely work, he literally couldn&#39;t function. Caller states the overall fatigue has not left, it&#39;s ongoing. Mouth sores that won&#39;t heal: Caller states began around 004Mar2021 or 05Mar2021 and stopped sometime in Apr2021, it took about a month. Caller states he recovered completely. Caller states he just wrote what happened down about every 2 days up until 14Mar2021. Joint Pain: Caller states literally every single joint in his body was killing him and felt inflamed. Caller states it began around 03Mar2021 or 04Mar2021. Caller states joint pain is ongoing, but has improved. Air Hunger, shortness of breath upon exertion: Caller states if he went up and down a few stairs, he would breathe almost as if he was having an asthma attack, it was shortness of breath upon exertion and started about four days after. Caller states it began around 05Mar2021. Caller states he actually had it this morning, felt like he just walked up a flight of stairs. Caller states he is very physically fit, so that should not happen. Caller states it&#39;s ongoing and has improved. Numb Extremities: Caller states a week later from 01Mar2021 he had numb extremities. Caller states he started being very aware of the fact that his fingers and toes were starting to lose feelings on 08Mar2021. Caller states it resolved within a week on 15Mar2021. Caller states it was a weird sensation that happened for a while but is completely resolved now. Body Temperature Regulation Issues: Caller states two days later, he had body temperature regulation issues. Caller states he was cold when he should have been hot and hot when he should have been cold. Caller states began around 03Mar2021/04Mar2021 and is ongoing, but not terrible, it&#39;s probably the least of the issues and has improved. Heart was pounding out of his chest; face was flushed: Caller states a day or two later, his heart was pounding out of his chest and his face was flushed to the point where people were asking if he was okay. Caller states he felt like he got a quick burst of a run and then stood still. His face was visibly red and very aware of his heart beating out of his chest and this is with no exertion. Caller states he was laying on the couch and he could feel his face flush while doing nothing basically. Caller states began 02 or 03Mar2021 and just stopped a week ago around 12Apr2021. He recovered completely, for now, it seems. Caller states he went to (Clinic name) on (Address), he doesn&#39;t have the doctors name, it was a walk-in. Caller states they literally said no big deal, it&#39;s all side effects of the vaccine, they just said he&#39;s fine. Caller states they simply recommended anti-inflammatories, Tylenol, which was smart and he wishes he thought about it. They also recommended Benadryl to stop the reaction. Caller states it was very helpful, the Benadryl really helped a lot. Caller states there was also a good amount of insomnia because of all the symptoms, it would be close to impossible to sleep. Insomnia: Caller states it seemed to get worse, started a week later because it  was getting disconcerting to him so he couldn&#39;t sleep. Caller states it started 08Mar2021 and have had that on and off with Lyme. Caller states has struggled for years, is ongoing and is persisting. Caller states on 14Mar2021, he couldn&#39;t sleep, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, completely weak and dizzy, his left leg and quad was spasming like when he had Lyme&#39;s, left knee itches, tingles, and burns and that&#39;s where he got bit by the tick and that&#39;s when he had his symptoms when he was acute. Caller states it resolved within 3 weeks after the initial onset of the shot. Caller states when he had Lyme initially, that&#39;s what he experienced, his left knee swelled, burned and itched, his left knee cap. Caller states ended 17Apr2021. Caller states its a situation where some of those are still there because of Lyme and some are gone. Caller states the knee cap stuff and can&#39;t get out of bed was gone on 17Apr2021. Caller states he has recovered completely. Caller states he still is weak and dizzy and his left leg and quad are still spasming, but it&#39;s better and is improved. Caller states on 20Mar2021, his left knee cap hurt, was twitching and tight, his left toe was numb, felt like something is chewing on his toe with a sensation of worms under the skin and sleep disturbances. Caller verifies the sensation of worms under the skin and something chewing on his toe is all related to neuropathy, which is still there. Caller states he had written down that on 20Mar2021, he was supposed to get his second shot at 1800, but was denied due to side effects he was experiencing and was rescheduled for 31Mar2021 at a local high-risk clinic. Caller states on 22Mar2021, he slept good, but was fairly weak all day. caller states he took a shower mid-afternoon, and couldn&#39;t get off the couch. Caller states basically all he did was take a shower and threw himself on the cough the whole day. Caller states he has written that he has the sensation of ants crawling over the top of his back, no desires to go outside, and light sensitivity. Caller verifies the ants crawling over the top of his back was also neuropathy, and he recovered completely within 3 weeks. Light Sensitivity: Caller states throughout the whole thing, had it today and is still ongoing and persisting. Caller states began sometime in Mar2021, its been the whole time. Caller states 28Mar2021, he only slept 6 hours and woke up completely fatigued, could not get out of bed until 2:00 in the afternoon, has a complete loss of appetite, had a drink and 2 eggs and laid down, couldn&#39;t move until 1930. Caller states got up, had a nutrition shake, he wasn&#39;t desiring solid foods whatsoever, had 100% malaise, fatigue, no appetite, and was dizzy. Loss of appetite: Caller states he has lost 7 pounds since the first shot. Caller states he wasn&#39;t really interested in eating. Caller states he has a natural desire to eat and nothing sounded good. Caller states started Mar2021, is ongoing, and has improved. Caller states 31Mar2021, he got the second shot, he had a little bit of irritation, tingling and burning at site and definitely a flushed face throughout the day, almost like a sunburn. Caller states he was joking with clients and said the first shot killed him and the second shot cured him. caller states after the second shot, he is 80% better but can list the remaining symptoms. Caller states what he is left with is fatigue, he does not have any energy to do anything other than work, sleep issues, neuropathy, and dizziness. Dizziness: Caller states the dizziness has been consistent and goes with the sleeplessness, ongoing since Mar2021 and is persisting. Irritation, tingling, and burning at injection site: Caller verifies the irritation, tingling, and burning is at the injection site of the second dose. Caller states it happened within a few hours on 31Mar2021 and resolved within a week on or around 07Apr2021. Covid Vaccine: First Dose: Caller verifies he received the injection in his left arm around 1800. Caller unsure of NDC. Covid Vaccine: Second Dose: Caller verifies he received the second dose on 31 Mar2021. LOT: ER8730, Expiry Date: They didn&#39;t write that down so caller unsure. NDC: Caller unsure of NDC. Caller unsure of dosage given. Caller states was given via injection in his right arm around 1300 or 1330. Covid Vaccine: Indication: Caller states first off he owns a business, he did it to be responsible to the public. Caller states he wants his business to appear as safe and compliant as possible. Caller states he definitely was afraid because of the Lyme disease. Concomitant Products: Caller states he made sure he did nothing before purposefully. Test Results: Caller states after the first shot, he went to (Name) family physician, they did a lot of blood work trying to make sure his inflammatory markers weren&#39;t going up, to make sure he wouldn&#39;t have issues. Caller states the good news was he was great, everything looked normal, there was nothing crazy in the blood work. Caller states they though the shots would have triggered an autoimmune response of Lyme. Muscle/Joint: He reports a bit of muscular/joint pain in the area where the shot is, if he goes to reach  The outcome of the event &#34;itching, burning rashes, like a visible rash on his chest with raised bumps&#34;, &#34;headache&#34;, &#34;can&#39;t workout or walk&#34;, &#34;exhausted&#34;, &#34;immune system was on the edge of crashing&#34;, &#34;immune system was on the edge of crashing&#34;, &#34;face was visibly red&#34; was resolved in Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;debilitating malaise&#34; was resolved with Sequel in Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;Numb Extremities&#34; was resolved in 15Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;mouth sores&#34; was resolved in Apr2021, the outcome of the event &#34;face was flushed&#34; was resolved in 12Apr2021; the outcome of the event &#34;couldn&#39;t get out of bed&#34; &#34;left knee itches, tingles, and burns&#34; was resolved in 17Apr2021, the outcome of the event Back disorder was unknown, the outcome of the event &#34;complete loss of appetite&#34;, &#34;Joint Pain&#34;, &#34;Body Temperature Regulation Issues&#34;, &#34;barely has the amount of energy to work let alone the others/Weak&#34; was resolving, the outcome of the other events was not resolved.

Checked into Urgent Care ficility again. Dr. took a check x-ray and EKG. Both came back normal with nothing unusual found.

MRI of the brain with and without contrast was done showing no acute intercranial abnormality.  MRI cervical spine showing no spinal cord abnormality.  And MRI T-spine showing no spinal cord abnormality.  Lumbar puncture was performed in the emergency room.  Protein was found to be elevated at 109.  Glucose was elevated at 134 CSF cell count within normal limits.  CSF PCR panel within normal limits.  Patient continues to complain of weakness.  Lumbar puncture was completed showing a protein elevated at 109 likely representing GBS.  MRI brain, cervical spine and thoracic spine showing no structural lesion.  At this time we will start IVIG 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days.  Patient will be seen by physical therapy and Occupational Therapy.  We will also consult inpatient rehab.

                                                tunnel vision; little woosy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for himself.  A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) in left arm on 19Jan2021 08:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma and high cholesterol; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included simvastatin. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient experienced events as stated, &#34;like I was seeing tunnel vision and a little woosy&#34; on 19Jan2021 13:00. No treatment was given to the patient for the events. The outcome of  the events was recovered on unspecified date. The events were considered non serious as it did not result in death, was not life threatening, did not cause/prolonged hospitalization, were not disabling/Incapacitating and were not a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

                                                Patient is noticed to have generalized weakness, holding his head towards right side, mild right facial puffiness with mild left facial droop, and sent to ER, on 1/22/21. Patient also had mild fever for the last two days and was on Tylenol, blood pressure also remained elevated moderately than the usual readings. Patient was admitted through ER for 2 days and was discharged on 1/24/21, with a diagnosis of possible TIA, Todd&#39;s paresis post seizure. Patient&#39;s CT head and MRI of brain was negative for acute stroke. Patient&#39;s left facial droop and right side facial puffiness resolved over a week but noticed to have right sided pronounced weakness with moderate swelling on right arm. Patient used to eat by himself,but now not able to do so and not able to hold cup in the right hand. Patient was again sent to ER for repeat CAT scan of head, further evaluation and management. Not sure if patient had an adverse reaction to Covid-19 vaccination, but definitely these symptoms were developed after 2 weeks of receiving Pfizer vaccination, which may be coincidental. Patient was followed up by the neurologist a week after the discharge from hospital who couldn&#39;t rule out adverse reaction of vaccination. Patient is awaiting for an EEG, carotid ultrasound and Echo as an out patient.

The second night the symptoms returned around 11:00 and persisted until morning.  They went away with more Tylenol and all but the injection site pain did not return. On the second dose I had the same symptoms The same night as injection.  They did not go away with Tylenol, and continued through the entire next day.  Fever never broke.

                                                38 hours after vaccination I woke in the middle of the night with extreme abdominal pain, dizziness, and severe diarrhea.  This continued for 2 hours.  I lost 6 pounds.  After continuing with some diarrhea all day on February 12th, I began having bloody mucous chunks as my stool.  I was advised by my doctor to go to the ER.  I was diagnosed with colitis in the ER and was admitted for several days for treatment due to the severe blood coming out.  CT scan showed severe inflammation, and stool sample showed blood and lactoferrin marker high.  I was given many antibiotics and fluids and was released home on February 14th, 2021.  I am still receiving treatment with oral antibiotics, and appointments with my physician.  I had to be absent from work for over 7 days.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EN6201), via an unknown route, on 12Feb2021 (at 12:45) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Relevant medical history included atrial fibrillation from Jun2020, ablation surgery for atrial fibrillation on unknown date, ongoing atrial tachycardia, and ongoing premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Past drug history included allergy to penicillin. Relevant concomitant medications included vitamin NOS, mineral NOS (MEGA MEN) and amino acids NOS, carotenoids NOS, herbal NOS, hyaluronic acid, methylsulfonylmethane, minerals NOS, vitamins NOS (GNC MEGA MEN SPORT). Within approximately two minutes of receiving the shot, he felt a warm sensation travel from the left shoulder area to his chest/upper stomach, his eyes burned, he could taste something, and his heart rate became rapid at a steadily increase amount. He watched his heart rate tick up on her watch to approximately 113 BPM. His normal resting heart rate was upper 60s. He felt dizzy and out of it for about 30 minutes. He felt like he had tunnel vision and lost speed sensation in the car he was driving. His pulse stayed at 92-94 BPM for approximately two hours. He wasn&#39;t anxious about getting the shot and had actually been looking forward to it. The patient was not treated for the events. The patient had recovered from &#39;felt dizzy&#39; on 12Feb2021 while the remaining events resolved in Feb2021.

                                                Patient was nervous prior to the vaccination. Once he received the vaccine he asked to use the bathroom and while he was in there he felt nauseous and came out of the bathroom. He then felt extremely light headed and nauseous that he almost collapsed to the floor. The pharmacist and myself (an immunizing pharmacy intern) rushed to check on him. He reported a little difficulty breathing but was still conscious. We proceeded to call 911 and gave one dose of 0.3 mg Epi-pen. After about 5 minutes he felt much better and was able to sit up. He reported that he never lost complete consciousness but was extremely nauseous and lightheaded. Patient handed over to EMS.

He was able to sit back down. No falls or trauma to his head or any part of his body. He was placed on a stretcher to a private section of the arena and monitored. Initially, his blood pressure was 103/69,  and interval blood pressure 20 minutes later was 139/73.  He was given water to drink, which he tolerated.  He reports that he has similar reactions to needles in the past, but the current presentation is longer than usual (symptoms usually resolve in five minutes). He was able to recover from the symptoms after 25 minutes of monitoring.

When I woke up the next day, the hives and rash covered everywhere except my head.  I took a shower and it became hard to breath, my eyes were very light sensitive, nauseous, and very dizzy.  I tried to make it back to my bed, but fell twice.  The second time I fell I stayed on the ground for about 5 minutes.  When I got up, everything was back to normal.  I left soon after to the Hospital emergency room to get checked.

                                                Drove to vaccination site. Had a coffee and muffin on way down; had a coffee and veggie wrap on drive back.  Once back home and at my computer for day, room started spinning - I made it outside to back porch, then vomited all food and liquid from the morning. I could not stand - felt like a giant hand was pushing me down - so I laid on my back porch for several hours. When I did stand up, the vertigo (dizziness and nausea) was immense. Made it to couch inside and toward evening gradually made it to bed upstairs, crawling part of the way. By the next morning the  spinning still present but about 50 percent less. Better if I kept eyes shut; spinning and nausea if I opened them. This eventually subsided later in day - I was able to hold down crackers and ginger ale.  By the following day (Wed.) I was able to work - the room spinning and dizziness was finally gone. And by this point able to hold down food and liquids.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 24Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 54 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cholesterol. The patient was diagnosed with BPH a few years back 2016 or 2017 and had a uralist in 2019 and that resolved his issues. The patient had been on no BPH meds and back to normal since that procedure. Co-suspect medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) from an unknown date to 01Apr2021 at 40 mg, 1x/day for blood cholesterol. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced prostate infections, and abdominal discomfort. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced arm pain, and was lightheaded. He described the arm pain as he had deltoid pain but he also had pain like he had been hit from his right pectoral down his arm to about 4-5 inches above his wrist. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, sweat, urinating blood, and dark colored urine. The patient was concerned with the dark urine so he stopped taking atorvastatin, and called his physician who said he didn&#39;t need it anyhow. The patient visited the urologist office and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) as treatment for dark colored urine, urinating blood and prostate infection. On 06Apr2021, the patient experienced leukocytes in urine. Relevant lab data on 06Apr2021 included a urinalysis which resulted in leukocytes and blood &#43;3. The action taken in response to the event dark urine with atorvastatin was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events prostate infection, and abdominal discomfort was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events arm pain, and lightheaded was recovered in 26Mar2021. The outcome of the events couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, and sweat was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of the events urinating blood and dark colored urine was recovered on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the event leukocytes in urine was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the serious events Prostate infection, Blood in urine, and Urine color abnormal are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drugs. Relevant medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may provide a plausible explanation for the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021450744 same patient/SD, different AE/dose

Patient had just finished working out for about 45 minutes when he noted tightness across his lower chest/epigastric region. Found to be in V tach upon arrival and underwent electrical cardioversion with relief of symptoms. Patient was aspirin loaded and started on heparin and lidocaine drips. He underwent cardiac cath which did not show any hemodynamically significant stenosis. Also underwent cardiac MRI which demonstrated a non-viable transmural infarct of the inferior wall. Etiology of VT was thought to be scar mediated from prior MI. Patient underwent uncomplicated ICD placement and was started on metoprolol. ICD interrogation POD 1 was unremarkable. Patient discharged in stable condition with close follow up with PCP, Cardiology, and EP. Patient with unchanged coronaries and unchanged ejection fraction.

                                                Client received his first COVID19 Pfizer dose (Lot #EW0187 Exp:  08/31/21) on 06/15/21 at 1654.  Client was accompanied by a friend and after receiving the injection they were instructed by RN1 to sit in the observation room for 15 minutes.  At approximately 1710 client was sitting in a chair in the observation room and informed RN2 and EMT that he felt dizzy.  RN2 and EMT opened the zero-gravity chair for client to sit in and client was able to transfer himself into it.  EMT also gave client a bottle of water and he took a few sips.  Client reclined in the zero-gravity chair and EMT took his vitals at 1722 (BP:  160/104, HR:  102, O2Sat:  97).  RN2observed that client was alert and oriented to time, place, event &amp; self and did not exhibit any cognitive impairment.  Client informed EMT and RN2 that he did not have any shortness of breath or trouble breathing.  Client also stated that he has a history of high blood pressure and fibromyalgia.  Additionally, client stated he was currently chewing nicotine gum because he had quit smoking two weeks prior.  EMT obtained vitals at 1731 (BP:  155/100, HR: 112, O2Sat: 97).  Client stated he was feeling a little better.  EMT took vitals at 1736 (BP:  151/102, HR: 109, O2Sat: 97).  Client stated he had eaten and drank plenty prior to getting vaccinated.  EMT took client?s vitals again (BP:  141/101, HR: 94, O2Sat: 97).  At 1755 client informed RN2 and EMT that he felt fine and was leaving.  EMT and RN2 observed client was using a walker and could stand just fine.  RN2 informed client that he should go to urgent care if he began to experience any dizziness and/or his blood pressure continued to exceed recommended guidelines. RN2 also recommended client monitor his blood pressure and seek medical attention if he began to experience any shortness of breath, trouble breathing, or chest pain.  Client and his friend then left the observation room.  EMT went to the Lead room at 1758 and informed Lead RN of the incident that just occurred with the client.  Lead RN reviewed details with EMT and determined that EMT and RN2 had not obtained a complete medical history on the client, determined what medications he was taking, and/or if he had any known allergies.  Lead RN immediately walked to the observation room with EMT and informed both he and RN2 of the proper protocol for follow if a client has a reaction to a vaccine.  Lead RN noted that while RN2 and EMT adequately monitored the client and documented their actions, they did not obtain all necessary information or notify a Lead or Co-Lead RN of the situation as it was occurring.  EMT and RN2 communicated that they now understand what the proper protocol is and will ensure that it is followed if future incidents occur.

                                                double vision whenever he moved his head; vision was disrupted when he would move his head; equilibrium was totally off; Head felt wobbly, head was in a fog type haze; The felling was scary; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 at vaccination age of 54-year-old via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22May2021 16:00 (Lot Number: EWO179) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Covid-19 in Nov2020 to Nov2020 prior to vaccination. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA) and alprazolam (XANAX), both indications, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received the most recent COVID-19 vaccine in a public health clinic or facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that 2 days after the vaccination (24May2021 08:00), the patient&#39;s vision was disrupted when he would move his head. He saw almost what you would call double vision whenever he moved his head, like while driving or looking from one side to the other. He couldn&#39;t drive for about 3 days because the movement of one car would look like 2 cars. This didn&#39;t happen when head was still and looking straight. His equilibrium was totally off, his head felt wobbly, his head was in a fog type haze for about 2 weeks. The feeling was scary. He mentioned that he did have covid Nov2020. He added that he made phone call to his doctor and they said to give it 2 weeks before coming in which is exactly when symptoms started to subside but still feel a little off. The patient did not received treatment for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

                                                about 36 hours after injection, after waking up, I had vertigo/dizzy spells when changing positions. These lasted over 24 hours depending on activity (which was not much as the early bouts were nauseating). In subsequent days, the dizziness has subsided to much more tolerable levels but still present after waking up or changing from laying down to standing up.

                                                Patient received first dose of Pfizer vaccine 3/24/21. Patient became unsteady and was directed to stretcher. Patient has a hx of HTN and reports not taking his BP medication for &#34;a while.&#34; Patient was unsure what BP medication he was on. Reports potentially taking Lasix and Vit K. Patient reports not eating or drinking prior to receiving the vaccination. Alert and oriented. Denies SOB/chest pain.     Vitals taken at 10:45AM:  BP 197/11  HR 75 SPO2 98% RA   ED rapid response called. Pt unable to stand up from stretcher.   Patient was taken to ED and neurology was consulted.  Neurology noted:  55-year-old man past medical history of hypertension coming with uncontrolled hypertension systolic over 220.  Concern for gait instability, no evidence of strength weakness on any extremity with confrontational testing.  No evidence of change in altered mental status, no evidence of cranial nerve palsy, and no evidence of sensory loss.   No evidence of coordination problems with finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing bilaterally.  He exhibits 5 out of 5 confrontational testing to all extremities muscles as above albeit with giveaway weakness.  NIHSS 0.     Although patient presents within TPA window he has had no disabling symptoms and therefore is not a candidate for TPA.  Although the patient presents with a mechanical thrombectomy window he has no disabling symptoms and no evidence of LVO either on exam or my preliminary read of his CTA head and neck.  As such he is not a candidate for mechanical thrombectomy.   Symptoms do not localize well although patient presents with clear hypertensive urgency versus hypertensive emergency.  Would recommend full medical work-up for this condition as we rule out signs of acute ischemic stroke.   Patient passes dysphagia screen in the ED.  Recommendation: 1. Admit to Observation.  2. MRI brain without contrast 3. Obtain stroke labs A1c, TSH, lipid profile 4. PT OT consult evaluation and treat 5. Social worker and case management consult for stroke work-up

A 55-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Mar2021 00:30 (lot number: ENG6199) (at age 55 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization administered in a pharmacy or drug store. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication included tramadol taken for numbing shot for tooth, start and stop date were not reported. No other vaccines received in four weeks. The patient experienced the following with his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Shot was painful and in about 15 to 20 minutes later everything felt fine. But by the time he and his wife drove out of town, he started to get HOT with the sweats, terrible headache, dizziness and started to lose his vision. He pulled over to let his wife drive and by the time he got out of the car he could barely navigate to the passenger side. They turned around and headed for the hospital, 8 min away, at this time he couldn&#39;t see anything, he was nauseated but knew the hospital was pretty close. During this whole time his heart rate never raced just kept and even beat. His breathing was also just fine. By the time they got into the parking lot his vision was slowly getting better, so they sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes with the air conditioner on as high as it could go. His wife read through the side effects, he was experiencing many on the list. They left without going in. Onset of the events was reported as 12Mar2021 12:45 AM. Treatment was not given for the events. The patient recovered from the event &#34;shot was painful&#34; on 12Mar2021; while recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Mar2021.

                                                The needle was inserted high up on my left shoulder, which was quit painful.  When the vaccine was injected, it caused additional discomfort.  Within 30 minutes, the left shoulder joint became agonizingly pain with any movement and I had loss of mobility.  Several hours later, the pain continued to worsen and any movement of the arm caused debilitating sharp pain.    During the night I used ice packs and took Advil, however the problem continued to worsen.  Today I am very concerned that the vaccine may have caused an injury to my shoulder.

                                                I was at the Neuroscience center and in the auditorium shorty after.  Where I started to sweat, blurred vision, very difficult to breath and losing some motor skills.  Luckily I got up in time and went to one of the nurses up front that got me to a waiting area to cool down, some water and to breathe without the mask.  Probably stayed about 30 minutes as my vitals were pretty low before returning to normal.  I will say it was pretty hot and a little crowded in there and the nurses all said it&#39;s been happening a bit with the heat in there. And it was about 11:40am so I only had crackers in the morning.

A 55-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP6955; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 24Mar2021 (at the age of 55years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heterotaxia (Situs inversus), ankylosing spondylitis, back problem, and cerebral palsy; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included diazepam, methocarbamol, meloxicam, salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), and unspecified muscle relaxant; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient reported side effects that has official after taking the COVID shot (confirmed as Pfizer COVID Vaccine). The patient stated &#34;I&#39;ve got cerebral palsy in my left hand and it seems to be a better connection in my left hand, I can now, it&#39;s easier for me to pick up small objects and I used to have problems doing that. It is like, I am messenger pain is eating my nerve endings. But here&#39;s what happened, 2 days after taking the shot around 26th, I took the shot on 24thMarch, 2021; I took Diazepam, Meloxicam and muscle relaxer (captured as unspecified medication) for back problem. I don&#39;t even know if it had anything to do with it, might be just been all the shot, but methocarbamol too. I took those 3 drugs, 2 hours after that, my whole hand, my whole left hand, just my left hand started hurting (further clarification unknown hence captured as suspect conservatively). In my left-hand kind of after feeling and I couldn&#39;t move my fingers as well. And afterwards it was in March, it started hurting, my whole hand swelled a little bit. It had like a slight fever to it, it was warm, and it swelled up just slightly not up here, nothing big. I still can&#39;t put in my ring, but it was slightly bigger than what it is today, and this hurt. It felt like, I&#39;ve chills my whole hand like it&#39;s going down. So, I work it out, I stretched it, that helped the pain so I could work with them during my fingers stopped working it out. And then afterwards I found out I could, my hands were moving better, it works better. Before I&#39;ve like little jerks in my hands, you know my hand wouldn&#39;t do what I wanted it to do. What I wanted to do more, I can press button, I can pick up smaller objects. It&#39;s not 100 percent better, it&#39;s not as good as my right hand which had no cerebral palsy in it but it&#39;s a lot better than it was. So, I just wanted to report that.&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.

I read where this was a side effect.  It has know been 11 days and the pain is getting worse daily and every step I take is about a pain level of 7-8 in my left knee.  It feels like my knee could break at any time.  I am going to wait until 2 weeks after my shot before I call my DR.  I read where side effects could last 2 weeks, but wanted to get this report in.  I am literally walking with a severe limp because of the pain.

The client looked flushed.  The client was instructed to lay on a mat on the floor.  Client drank some juice and ate some pretzels.  After 20 minutes he reported that he was no longer experiencing any symptoms.  As the client was standing up he reported that he felt dizzy but this resolved as he walked around the room.  He then wanted to sit outside so two nurse&#39;s went with him .  After 40 minutes he reported that all of his symptoms had resolved.  We followed up with the client on 4/25/21 and the client reported that he had not experienced any additional symptoms.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base. He had pain in the base of his right foot. Blood tests were in the second week. Glucose was high and he is hypoglycemic. Glucose 117 mg/dl (79-115 normal range), zinc 54 mcg/dl (60-120 normal range), CMV IGG AB &gt;10 u/mL (positive is &gt; or = 0.7 range). The outcome of the events was unknown.

I needed to remove the mask as I was having difficulty with the rapid heart rate and feeling of fainting. I also felt pins and needles type feeling in my legs and my face felt slightly swelled. I felt tired and that tired feeling lasted for the entire day. I stayed at the vaccination site for approximately 30 minutes at the advice of the EMT and went home. Later I had a slight headache but heart rate became more normal.

The ringing, deafness &amp; fullness continues until today. I have lost a lot of hearing acuity in both ears. I felt really ill (flu like) on 5/20/21. I had full body aches and severely sore throat. The PA prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg dosepak. I have been taking according to instructions. Today, I developed vertigo for the first time in 14 years.

A 55-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number, Expiration date, NDC and UPC number was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jun2021 at 11:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 55-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Regarding lot number patient stated that it looks like EW, patient thought he was not sure if it was 6185 or 0185, not sure it looks like 0 but it looks like 6 too but patient think it was 0. The patient medical history included shortness of breath, sleep apnea and kidney disease (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient sees a doctor for lot of conditions one was for shortness of breath and sleep apnea and sees a neurologist for Bph. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. Patient explained he was reluctant from getting vaccinated and nervous before the shot. On 06Jun2021, after patient took the shot, probably around 11:30 in the morning, patient was same, soon after 5 min maybe more, patient got a sensation on the left side of his tongue 5-10 mins, then  kind of a weird taste came to his mouth, patient started to get a little dizzy, a little light headedness, weakness in his chest and both his arms, got shortness of breath but had been seeing a doctor for shortness of breath prior taking the Covid shot and had kind of reluctant of taking the shot but some other issues going on side,  patient decided to take it, a couple of hours after the shot, patient had a headache, had the diarrhea. Patient described the weird taste like having a penny in his mouth. Patient explained he consulted a doctor on that Monday (07Jun2021), who said she encountered patients who also had the sensation on their tongues following vaccination, and that it was normal. Today (08Jun2021) patient had feeling just a little bit of nausea and patient kind a feel like a little brain fog, it was just his head doesn&#39;t feel right, the major concern was says some things risks factors and some of them had severe reactions, patient had a reaction difficulty in breathing, dizziness and feel little bit weakness, patient kind of a felt like his throat was going to close and he won&#39;t say he had any difficulty in swallowing, but it was not normal. Patient developed symptoms which spooked and scared him. Patient did not have his lab test but was constantly going to patient had just had right heart catheter right two weeks ago, you know last for him, patient was supposed to take another lab test to conduct at the end of the month for cholesterol, but patient saw neurologist for kidney disease. Events did not improve, patient just had this brain fog you know. Patient had to call a doctor after he got home, they did not prescribe him anything, patient mean he did bunch of appointment with doctor with the phone as soon as he got home from taken a Covid shot he was little worried. Patient stated he was concerned about getting the second dose of vaccine scheduled on 27Jun2021. Patient stated he will not be able to consult his doctor before the vaccination appointment and was not able to get further assistance from a pharmacist. Patient repeated he does not know what to do about the second dose. Patient was kind of reluctant taking the next shot, if he was going to feel the something like this again, he don&#39;t want to, as he already had uneasy you know just had and patient did not had difficulty in breathing all of time this comes and go,  from the sentence he described it says on pamphlet that there was severe reaction to the shot and don&#39;t want to take the second shot and then end up in hospital because patient had more from it so his question was he was afraid to take the second shot. Patient don&#39;t had answer to that he means he would like to talk to somebody who can give him information kind of help me to relax little bit if it was normal and in in response it was responded that decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by the company. Patient was referred to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection, as healthcare provider knows his health situation and had access to information that can better help inform this decision. The outcome of brain fog was not recovered and outcome for other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number is requested.

I also developed upset stomach , but that one went away.  The dizziness continued into the second dose and still continues.  The second dose is EP 7533.  I still get dizzy when i lay down and when get up, then it sort of normalizes, but when i lay down flat back and head up, dizziness starts.  I have to be careful when i get out of bed and have to wait until i gain my balance back.

                                                On Thursday April 1, 10 days after the vaccine (1st shot)  I began to experience itch hives all over my body.  I took Benadryl at 2 pm and 8 pm to relieve the symptoms. It helped. At 7 am,  morning of Friday April 2,  I took Claritin to relieve symptoms but it was not effective. At 9:15 am,  morning of Friday April 2,  my lips and cheeks began to go numb, and it felt as if my throat and tongue were swelling.  At 9:30 am. I checked in to the ER.  They monitored my condition and indicated my blood pressure and oxygen levels were normal. At approximately 10:15 am, my mouth began to feel normal again. While at the ER, the  doctor checked out my hives and gave me Prednisone. She also gave me a prescription for 4 days of Prednisone, 50 mg tablets,  and advised to continue taking Benadryl to relieve symptoms. I have taken Prednisone once a day for past couple days and Benadryl 3 times a day. Hives are still present today Sunday April 4, 2021 but milder than previous days.[Not certain if this is important, but on  day 3 and 4 after the vaccine, I reported dizziness on mobile app check-in. The dizziness went away by day 5. I had no other symptoms appear until day 10 reported here.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer reported that her 56 years-old male son (patient) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation on 24Mar2021. Relevant history and concomitant drugs were unknown. The reporter stated that her 56 year old son received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine a day earlier than she received hers (which was on 25Mar2021) and while waiting after getting his vaccination, her son became &#34;very, very dizzy.&#34; He told the nurse working at the vaccination site that the dizziness was getting worse and &#34;getting very bad.&#34; He was asked how his breathing was and he told the nurse it was okay, but an ambulance was called for him anyways and he was sent to the hospital. Her son reported feeling better when he laid down but still reported feeling dizzy. At the hospital, her son was told that all the test came back okay. When her son got up to use the restroom with the assistance of the doctor, the doctor told him that he was dehydrated and gave him IV fluids. Caller stated that her son reported feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; after the IV fluids but &#34;couldn&#39;t hardly walk&#34; and had to have someone else drive him. Her son reported feeling &#34;alright&#34; the next day. Caller stated that she was reading in the information pamphlet on the Pfizer vaccine that a severe reaction could include dizziness. Caller was worried about her son getting his second dose and think she should speak with his physician before receiving his next dose, and would like to know if this was okay. She was concerned because she states that she had heard that people have gotten sick from the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was resolving. Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

I checked my standing blood pressures and notices that it was very low 83/56 with a heart rate of 110. This went on for several weeks with standing blood pressures in the 80-90&#39;s/50-60&#39;s . I was having difficulty with daily activities where I would get tired just going up and down steps.   I was very concerned and made an appt with my Dr.  He did not think it was related to the vaccine. I was treated with chemo and radiation in 1984 for Hodgkins disease  (MOPP and ABVD) were the chemo agents.  This treatment as left me with mild orthostatic hypotension which I have been dealing with for over 10yrs however I have

                                                Became very unsteady on my feet within 2 weeks of getting the fist shot. Went for second shot despite being unsteady, it has not gone away now going on 10 weeks. Hearing is down and fullness in my left year.  Saw an ENT and my family practitioner. Nothing they can do, so I  take meclizine on the really bad days, which helps a little. Very hard to function since the shot.

                                                After walking for about 4 miles in my friends neighborhood my left knee became tender and swollen. The next day I went on a 3.5 mike easy hike and my left knee became very swollen and I couldn&#39;t walk on it. I was pondering going to the emergency room... Thought maybe I tore something.  I&#39;m a former college football player and I&#39;ve had all kinds of injuries. My knees have been bullet proof so far. I&#39;ve never had a swollen knee. About six months ago I hyperextend my left knee and it was still a little tender. Long walks and hikes never caused any swelling just painful if it was hyper extended.  It&#39;s possible the flight was a factor but I think the shot somehow caused my knee to swell.  After the hike I was walking around again in a few days.  The strangest thing... The tenderness behind my knee that had been there for almost six months was gone and hasn&#39;t come back.  Just wanted to document this odd reaction.

If he was too happy or too nervous get upset. He can eat spicy food, not super hot, but he can eat anything and it doesn&#39;t go crazy. He has a little bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes. He can&#39;t take a multivitamin or supplements because he would get sick to his stomach, this was before the vaccine. He was getting that same sick feeling now that he would get if he was taking a multivitamin. He had his blood drawn a week before he had the vaccine to check his kidneys with the pills he is on. It was perfect and normal, and he has had nothing since then. In his 20s he had the flu vaccine, and he had never had the flu in his life. That year he got the worse flu sick of his life. He never got the flu vaccine or other vaccines after that. That was probably between 1987 to 1990. His folks passed away. He had been in the hospital when he was little.Concomitant medications included acetaminophen taken for back pain, sciatica from an unspecified start date and ongoing; nabumetone taken for sciatica, back pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient experienced he passed out for 2 days (medically significant) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, been sick pretty much everyday (non-serious) on 07Apr2021 22:00 with outcome of not recovered, not feeling good in his stomach (non-serious) on 07Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, slept all day for several days (non-serious) on 08Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, responding strangely to people/but is still there and is so weird (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting (non-serious) on 15Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, his whole torso hurt and his stomach (non-serious) on 15Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, diarrhea (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, getting really irritable (non-serious) on 09Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, he had no energy (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of recovering, he was lethargic/weakness (asthenia) (non-serious) on 12Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, dizzy (non-serious) on 10Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast (non-serious) on 17Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, breathing hard (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, wouldn&#39;t feel good (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, arm started hurting where he got the shot (non-serious) on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, headache (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, his arm was a little sore (non-serious) on 13Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, a fast heartbeat (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, chills (non-serious) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown. Patient got sick around 10:00 at night. He was supposed to get his second dose but he was so sick and they said lets give it a week. Then he talked to his doctor and he said to wait 2-3 weeks to make sure he is back to normal. So he is scheduled for the second dose next week at 6 weeks. He asked if it was okay that the shot was given in the sunlight. He stated that he saw that it was in an ice chest but the person had to walk it over to him 20 feet and deal with his sleeve for a second or two so it was in the sun. He said all that walking it was 100% in the sun and he has read that it should not be in the sun. He asked if this could have caused bacteria and caused his symptoms. He stated his doctor was only concerned about giving him antibiotics for bacteria if it was in the sun and if that was a problem. He just read from CDC, once mixed the vaccine can be left at room temp for 6 hours and mixed vaccine does not need to be protected from light. So it sounds like his first shot was good. He had gotten the shot at about 1430 in the afternoon. He was like he is going to get the shot and everything will be great. He didn&#39;t think there would be an effect. Then strangely enough at about 2200 he was about to eat dinner and he got to not feeling good in his stomach. It had been close to 8 hours. The next day he slept all day, got up and had coffee, and Saturday he was in the chair in the living room. He is never in the chair during the day because he works. He slept all day and all night and the next day. He was responding strangely to people, and he was in and out of it. He had the shot on Wednesday and then his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting. He has back pain anyway and bone spurs on his spine. He was telling his wife whatever pain he is normally in was enhanced. His whole torso hurt and his stomach. The following Monday he had diarrhea. Then he started getting really irritable and didn&#39;t want to talk and was impatient. He was lethargic and had no energy. That was the second week. By the end of the second week he had a couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast. He thought it was a heart attack, then thought it was just pain not a heart attack. Every time he wouldn&#39;t feel good he would start breathing hard. Once in a while he gets pain through his chest area. His stomach would start and he would breath hard every time he didn&#39;t feel good. The third week he was supposed to get the second shot. He called the department of health for New Mexico. The nurse called back and said not to do the shot that week but to wait a week. He rescheduled for a week later. By the third week he was still not feeling good and called the doctor. He asked about the pain in his chest 3 times and he said it seemed to be okay. His arm started hurting where he got the shot in the second week. He still had no energy and he told the doctor this. Patient started taking 2 extra Tylenol during the day for pain. Lately he has been good until one little thing and then all of a sudden his stomach is hurting and he is holding his stomach. He was good today, all he did was eat a cookie and he didn&#39;t get sick. He was worse for a little while in the first or second week, he was really bad. It came and went over the next 2 weeks and now it is coming and going less frequently. He slept through 2 or 3 days. Thursday, Friday, and then Saturday he was in and out. He woke up to take the garbage out on Friday then saw he already took it out and forgot it was out there. And it was Saturday. He was kind of out of it. When he would respond strangely he would respond with a question he just asked and someone answered. It is like brain fog or like he is on something. It started after the weekend, more on 12Apr2021. Once in a while he will forget a little something still, but just once in a while. He would walk and hold his rib cage with both arms when he was hurting. He wrote down that it felt like somebody had hit him in the back with a bat in the lower back. One day it was that bad. His back pain was on Thursday 15Apr2021. The pain now is not like where it hit him with the back. He has back pain every day but more than he used to. The sore like he was hit in the back pain was just the one day. He had diarrhea 12Apr2021, 13Apr2021, and 14Apr2021 then it left for probably a week. Then it came back last week one day. Instead of every day it was every 3 or 4 days. He has not had it in the last 4 days. He hopes it is done. He noticed any time he has salad or lettuce he feels bad in the morning so he stopped eating those. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. The irritable feeling started right away the Friday of the week he got the shot. He is still struggling some, it will come and go. Yesterday he was zonked. With having no energy it is a big thing. He has to do something instead of what he would be doing. He works all day and takes long orders and stuff. Now he does like one order when normally he did 10. One for him is a huge little sore so he will lay on his right side. His left arm still hurts like a pulling hurt from his neck to his arm. It has been every day from 13Apr2021. It is much better and he will move and it will relax a little bit. It was really weird. The whole time he held the phone with his left hand up until one second he moved his phone and it was the same pain. At night the left side where he had the injection pulls on his neck muscle coming from his arm. He was actually taking two Tylenol in the morning and two at night when he went to bed. With the pain he takes 2 during the day, 650mg each. He was just taking 500mg and then his wife said take these. It seems to have gotten a little better. He always took them 2 times a day and now he takes them 3 times a day. After the first dose he experienced difficulty breathing dizziness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, chills, nausea, headache, he passed out for 2 days and has been sick for 5 weeks. He started having some dizziness a couple of days later and reports, it&#39;s like I would stand up too quickly and get a head rush, that kind of dizzy feeling. He confirmed that his dizziness did not start until a couple of days after he received his first dose.

A 56-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 26Mar2021 11:15 (at the age of 56-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Penicillin allergy, pain, arthritis, was hospitalized when the patient was small for 15 days in a bubble following an allergic reaction, and had knee surgery. Concomitant medications included ongoing vitamin c [ascorbic acid] taken to make sure he doesn&#39;t catch a cold; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN BAYER) taken for pain, arthritis, and as a preventative to make sure he doesn&#39;t get any clogs; and ongoing ascorbic acid, betacarotene, biotin, boron, calcium, calcium pantothenate, chloride, chromium, colecalciferol, copper, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, iodine, iron, lycopene, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, nicotinamide, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, silicon dioxide, thiamine, tin, tocopheryl acetate, vanadium, vitamin k nos, zinc (CENTRUM MEN) taken for multi-vitamins, after a certain age you need to take a multi vitamin. On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t move his body, wasn&#39;t feeling like himself, he started having chills, shivering, and fever yesterday (29Mar2021) then had a rapid test and he came positive, and butt cheeks hurt; on an unspecified date, scalp hurt, and everything hurts. Brushing his teeth hurts. It was further reported that they went to take a rapid test in the morning of 30Mar2021 and he came positive. The patient didn&#39;t have problems Friday/Saturday/Sunday. Yesterday (29Mar2021), he woke up and he felt like he&#39;s been having aches and pains and when he took a shower, washing his head hurt. And his butt cheeks hurt from sitting down. He&#39;s allergic to penicillin and they kept them there for 30 minutes. Everything was fine. No side effects from Friday through Sunday. But yesterday (29Mar2021), he started having chills, shivering, and fever. Additionally, it was reported that the patient was tested for Covid-19 prior to getting vaccinated and the results were negative. The wife also clarified that last night, 29Mar2021, the patient had chills, couldn&#39;t move his body, and had a temperature of 101-102. Therefore, they both made an appointment to get tested at 09:30 this morning (30Mar2021) to get tested. The patient&#39;s test came back positive. The wife again states they are going back tomorrow for a rapid and mouth Covid-19 test. Furthermore, it was reported that yesterday (29Mar2021), her husband woke up and wasn&#39;t feeling like himself. In the night, he was hot, shivering, and his temperature got up to 101. The patient&#39;s temperature was not so high this morning but that he still wasn&#39;t feeling himself. He began not feeling like himself yesterday morning, 29Mar2021. The patient confirmed that he still feels unlike himself today. The wife also reported that every time her husband would move he said that everything hurts. Brushing his teeth hurts. He even said his butt cheeks hurt. When her husband was taking a bath and passed the soap over his head, his scalp hurt. The wife makes the comment that this isn&#39;t like her husband. The patient works like a mule and doesn&#39;t complain about anything. That&#39;s why the wife got worried. For example, the patient had knee surgery and walked out limping but did not use a cane because that was the kind of man he is. He was not whiner so when he tells you something&#39;s wrong, something&#39;s wrong. The patient&#39;s second dose was scheduled 16Apr2021. The patient was allergic to the penicillin class in generalized. When the patient was small, he was hospitalized for 15 days in a bubble following an allergic reaction. The wife reported that the patient drinks (takes) every day religiously one Centrum for men, one Vitamin c, and an aspirin. She clarified all the medications that her husband drinks (takes) he has been on for at least 10 years, since he was 35 or 40 years old, tops. All of these medications are approved by the doctor. She mentions when she try and give her husband a pill, he just looks at it. He won&#39;t even drink (take) a Tylenol. Her husband works construction and was around a lot of dust. Sometimes, he will work with Clorox and stuff like that cleaning towers, so he just takes Vitamin C to stay safe. Their son was a vet and when her husband helps their son with the animals, he takes it to make sure he was clean. She also clarified that her husband drinks (takes) the aspirin that was for arthritis because he&#39;s 57 and has worked very hard. She believes the dose was 325 or 500, she was not sure. She clarified further it&#39;s the aspirin that&#39;s for body and aches. His doctor doesn&#39;t let him take any more than one tablet daily in case he gets cut, he could bleed. The patient takes the aspirin daily because both his dad and mom died of aneurysms so he was told to take an aspirin daily to make sure his arteries and everything are clean. It&#39;s a preventative to make sure he doesn&#39;t get any clogs and for the pain. She makes the comment unfortunately, their son that&#39;s 35 had to have 2 open heart surgeries. She and her husband have not been in contact with anyone. They have 3 small grandkids and a son with a history of open heart surgery. The wife reported that she and her husband live in a bubble. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101-102 on 29Mar2021 and COVID-19 test which was negative on an unspecified date in Mar2021 and then became positive   on 30Mar2021. On an unspecified date, the patient recovered from COVID-19 while outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

                                                Approximately 1 hour after I received the shot I pressure and stiffness on the left half of my head and face. I did not have muscle weakness any where or slurred speech. That sensation was not painful, but it was very noticeable like someone&#39;s hand was on your face. That was present for about two days at a significant level. Five weeks later it is still present but at a much milder degree. Also persistent over the entire 5 weeks since the shot is mild dizzyness off and on each day, along with increased headaches. Since i have chronic post concussion syndrome, it is normal for me to get headaches, but since the vaccination I have been getting headaches more frequently and I am a lot more sensitive to the usual triggers. I have a persistent mild pain in or around my left eye that never existed before.

                                                I had my first shot of Pfizer vaccine last Friday morning (March 5). In the evening, I felt fatigued. So I went to sleep early. When I got up Saturday morning, I felt dizzy. The dizziness went away in a few minutes. In the next 36 hours, I had the angina feelings - tightness in the left chest and I felt heart be squeezed occasionally. When I stand up and walk, I felt better. Finally Sunday evening (March 7), I took a walk outside and felt symptom free. Maybe the walk helped, maybe the &#34;thrombosis&#34; had run its course before my walk.   I have not had the severe angina symptoms since my PCI procedure in Feb 2018. I am sure the recent occurrence is related to the vaccine.   Besides reporting the adverse event, I want to get advices whether I should receive the second shot.   Thank you!

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

This is the second of two reports. The reporter describes events following both vaccinations in a vaccine series. This report is for those events which occurred following the second vaccination.      A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3249), intramuscularly on 01Feb2021  (at the age of 57-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s historical vaccinations included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 after which he experienced inflammation, joint pain and burning sensation in the joints. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The vaccination was administered at a hospital. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen (TYLENOL), tamulosin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) all from unspecified dates and for unknown indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Per the reporting physician, he got his first vaccine on 22Dec2020.  His MCP and PIP joints and SI joints started burning close to 3rd week in Jan2021. He had some minor SI pains intermittently before but none with hands. Continued hurting enough that he started taking Osteobiflex and fish oil and more tylenol for inflammation. After second vaccine on 01Feb2021 the symptoms he experienced after the first dose have been getting worse.  He mentioned that his hands burn all the time, at times like tonight bad enough that they keep him awake.  He has red nodular areas on some of his knuckles and a distinct nodule at the proximal ulnar aspect of my left 4th finger PIP that is uniformly erythematous. Not all knuckles have the same degree of burning, but all including thumbs have it. The SI joint pain is more variable and at time does not bother him, but the hands get swollen and tight to close everyday. He plans to start some prednisone tomorrow due to the progression of the burning. The clinical outcomes of the events burning sensation in joints worsened, swelling of hands, stiffness joints, inflammation, condition worsended, erythema, nodule on extremity were reported as not recovered. The outcomes of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administration and off label use were unknown.  It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021154881 Same patient, same drug, different AE, different dose of vaccine.

Patient reported that he was going to get lightheaded as he normally gets this way with vaccines or blood draw. Patient never passed out; however, he almost fell when getting up from the vaccine chair, he reports lightheadedness and requested to lay down on the ground and have his feet elevated. Oxygen was brought to patient by post observation and 2 Liters delivered maintaining 99% saturation. After approximately six minutes, patient decided to get up from the ground. Two staff including patient?s wife assisted him to stand however, patient requested to be seated for a while. Patient was then moved to post observation where he was conscious, speaking clearly and monitored for an additional 30 minutes with no further incident.

Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

He is experiencing cramping all over his body but especially his legs. He has a terrible headache, feels nautious  and dizzy. Today has been the worst. This is day 3 after the  Pfizer shot.  The internet says it is normal for the lymph node in about 14% of patients. Your flyer handed out at injection day didn&#39;t mention all of this.

Lower extremities had pitting edema: lower legs and feet. I tried a diuretic (flouresime) but it did not help. I tried elevating legs and no change. Used a tems machine with electrodes to increase blood flow in calves but it did not help. Could not get shoes or socks on and ankles were so swollen that walking was very difficult since range of motion was inhibited and could not bend ankles. No relief until 2 weeks later it is now starting to subside. Still significantly swollen when getting 2nd vaccination today 4/2 at 12;20 pm lot EP7533.

Symptoms started during the evening of 3/30/21 after vaccination.  PCP was contacted on 3/31/21 and we were told the effects would only last 48  hours.

It felt like I was on a ship in heavy seas.  I don&#39;t think I could have driven a car.  I laid down around noon and slept for about 90 minutes.  Upon waking the symptoms had lessened.  I had another occurance (about the same severity as my post-nap symptoms from previous incident) on April 4th.

                                                Approximately 1-2 minutes after injection, my throat began to close and I was having difficulty breathing and speaking. Dizziness followed. I told the attendant that I needed help. They knew that I had my epipen with me. From that time on, all I recall was asking someone to use the pen. An employee successfully administered the epipen. I was then placed on the floor with my head raised as I could no longer swallow or breathe. All that I can recall from that point was speaking with paramedics at the CVS and was feeling successful results from the epi pen. I was taken to Rockledge Medical ER where they took me in immediately and administered steroids and other antihistamines.

Patient was found down on 4/25/2021 for an unknown amount of time and EMS was called. Patient noted to be seizing on EMS arrival. Blood glucose was noted to be 32 and an amp of D50 was administered. Patient arrested, received CPR (approximately 1 round) and was intubated in the field. His second glucose reading was undetectable and he received a second amp of D50. Patient also received sodium bicarb, calcium, and epinephrine and transported to ED. Patient subsequently transferred to Medical Center. He was treated for septic shock. His mentation remained very poor after pressors weaned off and sedation stopped. He likely had severe brain injury from hypoglycemia and anoxia - poor brainstem reflexed but did have spontaneous breathing - very poor prognosis - patient was extubated for comfort measures and all interventions stopped after family discussion and per their plan.

The weakness is so severe that he could not bend the elbow to lift (flexion)the hand up, nor lift the shoulder forward or out.(no flexion or abduction). no new symptoms in the Right arm or either leg.  there is severe atrophy of the proximal musculature of the left shoulder and upper arm.

                                                began to experience dizziness/vertigo 2 weeks after 1st dose of pfizer vaccine.  For the first 5 days symptoms were intermittent, occurring 0-2 times per day, for several hours at a time.  Intensity was mild to medium.  Symptoms were worse when moving around, or with more head or eye movement.  Eating could also make symptoms worse.  On the sixth day the symptoms went from intermittent to constant, except when lying down. Symptoms remain constant on day 8.  Intensity still varies from mild to medium throughout the day.  I have not sought medical treatment at this point, mostly due to other people with the same symptoms reporting that Drs/ENTs were unable to find anything wrong or help them.

                                                Day of Vax:  At about 2pm....I had a severe reaction forcing me to lay down for several hours....body aches and pains, mental confusion, really weird feelings throughout my body. I had to take sick time from work.  I felt better in the evening. Day 2(wed):  woke up with moderate/extreme fatigue....body did not feel good...could not work took more sick time...spent most of day in bed. Day 3(thurs):  Was going to try to get back to regular schedule.....worked in the morning...did my usual lunch time hike.....in the afternoon suffered from another bout of moderate/extreme fatigue...could not work..took more time off....in the evening had chest pain in my back between my shoulder blades. Day 4(fri):  I am filling out this form...woke up with pain in between my shoulder blades....that seems to be feeling a little better now....I am trying to get back to my regular routine and have been working this morning.  I believe that I will continue to get fatigued for a few more days....and I&#39;m very sensitive between my shoulder blades.

I had felt fine from after the shot at 10:30am that day (Thursday 5/6/21)  until that evening, where I did feel some soreness in those joints. I took two Alleve pills an hour prior to bedtime.  I woke up in pain at 2:00AM that night (5/7/21) on the said joints, about a level 6-7 out of 10.   By morning the pain had subsided a bit, but I was in pain walking for the next day (Friday) and today (Saturday).

Second stage was dizziness/ vertigo seemed like my brain was going to explode.  Ringing in ears and then intense vivid dreams.  It?s been two weeks since the second shot and I am still dealing with the dizzy spells. The headaches have gone . Also another symptom was I would get weak at times not for long but in spells. Still trying to over come this pressure and dizzy feeling other than that now I am getting better.

About 6 days post vaccine, I woke up with flushing and both ears started to ring, more signficantly in the left ear.  I took my blood pressure and it was elevated at 160/90.  I went to the doctor the next day and had an MRI (came back normal).  I was prescribed blood medication (amlodipine). I went to an audiologist and was found to have hearing loss.  I went back to my PCP and my BP was still elevated and was prescribed atenolol in addition to amlodipine.   Currently, I am still having flushing, fatigue, and tinnitus.

This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it&#39;s still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it&#39;s lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can&#39;t think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn&#39;t want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn&#39;t know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node&#39;s reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks.

Note that  I had similar reactions to the flu vaccine&#39;s for 17 straight years , with the exception of the brain fog. Flu shot reactions stopped when I started taking Amway  Double X multivitamins and tripling up on Vitamin A, C, Zinc and echinacea 3 days before through after the vaccine.  Shot 1 - initial  side effects: 40 minutes after shot within a mile of returning to work from hospital, I suddenly got lightheaded and very tired with brain fog creeping in. Since that was closer than home, I continued  on to work hoping it would soon pass.  Brain fog,  dizziness and fatigue all  continued to worsen, and I was taken home. Effects lasted 9 hours. 3-4 days later the symptoms all came back and lasted 2-3  days, with the addition of temperatures in mid to high 96 range. My normal temperature is a degree low at 97.8.

                                                No initial symptoms other than sore arm at injection site which lasted for about 23 hours. On January 28 in the middle of the night woke up with pain in left hand. Could not move left hand. Was sleeping on back - not on arm or hand.  No restricted blood-flow.  Massaged hand and it became responsive.  This was followed by burning and tingling sensation in hand.  Hand was cold to touch first day. Burning and tingling and muscle tension increased for first couple days.  Would be intermittent and location varied. Hands and feet most common. Left back scapular area and left pectoral muscle common.  Muscle tightness would cause joint pain without signs of any redness. No temperature. No discoloration. Not as bad in middle of the day. After a few days. When second shot was administered on February 9 at 12:10 AM went home and all sensations stopped for about 12 hours. Took Tylenol with some benefit to diminish but not end symptoms. In past few days have read about taking antihistamines which has often helped.  Symptoms are not as intense as they started out to be, but they continue to linger.  Muscle tightness has largely given way to fluttering sensation or paresthesia and burning is mostly in bottom of left foot only. Any muscle tightness can be rubbed out (massage) for the most part. Occasional joint tightness continues in fingers - crack knuckles and it improves.

                                                Pt reported he got the second COVID vaccine at 8:33 am at the  Center at an event run by Health Clinic. At 10 am he began to feel unwell describing &#34;disorientation&#34; which upon further explanation seems he is describing difficulty with his proprioception, ie not able to tell where his body is in space, and disequilibrium, ie having to stop and hold on to something while walking. This lasted most of the day and subsided by evening. He has continued to have ongoing shorter episodes 3-4 times per day lasting 5-10 minutes. In addition he has noted increasing weakness in his right thigh, particularly when going from sitting to standing and the through swing while walking. He describes these as &#34;paralytic attacks&#34; that occur once or twice per day and last hours. Both symptoms are similar to those he had post CVA in 2019 and greatly improved with PT and home exercises. In addition he has noted fecal urgency and fecal incontinence in the last couple of weeks, he is unsure if this is directly related to the vaccine.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

                                                Right Foot started hurting the night after the vaccine. The next day, it hurt to  walk on it. Mainly around the base of my 2nd and 3rd toes. The next day it hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t walk on it and saw the doctor. A red area had developed on top of my foot at the base on my toes. Doctor though could be Gout but didn&#39;t really look like it and usually that is in the big toes. Plus the timing of this issue and my vaccine were suspect. Had X-ray on that Friday, two days after vaccine and everything looked fine they said. I was prescribed Celebrex  and over the weekend took two per day due to the pain. I stayed in bed all weekend and pain got worse before taking another dose of medicine which helped for a while.  Swelling continued to be about the same or a bit more and the redness moved over to my big toe and then up my foot around towards the right side. Today my right side of foot is really soar now as well and still can&#39;t walk on it and still swollen. Doctor at a urgent care sports medicine location prescribed me Prednisone steroid to see if that helps. But so far 5 days after vaccine and my foot is still swollen, red across the top and so painful it keeps me up at night and I can&#39;t walk on it. I&#39;m hoping the steroids work.

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscularly on 19Mar2021 at 13:00 (01:00 PM) (Batch/Lot Number: ep6955) at the age of 58-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. There was no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history and patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced lightheaded/syncope episode on 19Mar2021 at 13:15 (01:15 PM). The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. It was unknown if the patient received treatment for the events. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported event syncope episode cannot be completely ruled out given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had surgery for spinal stenosis on 07/09/2020, including a decompression and fusion at L4/L5.  I reported the following symptoms, which I attribute to the COVID-19 vaccination, to my spine surgeon.  I had my second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, March 29th at 5:45 PM.   Lower back pain in the general area of my surgery (07/09/2020) woke me up from sleep around 4:30 AM Tuesday (03/30/2021) morning.  Being woken up from sleep had never happened previously - not before surgery, following surgery, ever.  I recall the pain being a dull throbbing ache, nothing sharp.   I recall being generally pain free Tuesday during the day and went for a mile and half walk Tuesday evening and hit  about 20 40-yard (or less pitch shots) Tuesday evening.   I woke up Wednesday at my usual 6:45 AM.  Although I don&#39;t recall being in pain getting out of bed, I do remember being in excruciating pain the remainder of the day.  It hurt to walk (landing either foot) and the only position that I had any relief was sitting at work.  The pain was frequent, sharp, and up to a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.  I felt exhausted and feel asleep at 7:30 PM Wednesday night.   I was in significantly less pain Thursday, although it was still uncomfortable rising from a seated position and bending at the waist (to assume a putting position in the office) caused pain to the extent that I chose not to fully bend.  Thursday night was generally OK but there was one point, while seated on a couch, where I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the general area of my surgery.  I tried to change positions to alleviate the pain, but it persisted for 30 seconds before finally subsiding.  The pain felt like I was being stabbed and it was a 8 or 9 on a 1 to 10 scale.   Friday was a repeat of Thursday.  Generally, I have very little pain except when I stand from a seated position (1 or 2 on a 10 point scale) or bend slightly at the waist (3 or 4).  The pain is dull but the pain from bending does prevent me from bending comfortably.   All of this pain is new this week since Monday.  This past weekend I worked in the yard, including some heavy lifting and digging.   Is there any chance this is a side effect of the vaccine?  Should I schedule an office visit to evaluate the pain?  NOTE:  I was generally symptom free by Saturday, 04/03/2021 and totally symptom free by 04/05/2021.

                                                I woke at 6:30am on 04/07/2021 in a state of complete confusion and disorientation.  It was a level of disorientation I have never experienced before in my lifetime.  I fainted one time and was having extreme difficulty getting my bearings and walking and was simply in total &#34;mental disarray&#34;.  I was having difficulty producing words, a prolonged stutter, you might say.  I was shaking.  The local paramedics came and I was taken to the local ER.  Because I was having difficulty speaking, the paramedics (and later the physicians) thought I might have had a TIA.  An MRI on 04/07/2021 at 5pm produced a negative result.  So i can only attribute my reaction to the vaccine.  It was very significant, and i thought it made sense to report it.

I do not have a history of arthritis at the location. Has become increasingly worse to the point that I cannot lift the arm without severe pain in the shoulder joint area. Tylenol and ibuprofen do not seem to help.

He swallowed a few times but was difficult to do so.  It then eased up and then 30 minutes later when he was getting up to leave he was light headed.  He walked out and got to the car, came home and still felt a little light headed, sat around for a couple of hours and was doing better.  He went outside to do a few things and was stumbling around and went back into the house.  He went to take a shower and still had the bandaide on his arm, took the bandaide off and while driving off he saw that he had a rash the size of a 50 cent piece around 7:30.  He got up the next morning and the rash was gone, the dizziness was gone and everything was fine.  He did not take anything for his reaction.

                                                passed out/unconscious; feel weak; dizzy; not normal; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 26Mar2021 09:45AM (Lot Number: ER8730) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no other medical history or known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not have COVID test post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. After taking the vaccine the patient waited for 15 minutes prior to departing the facility in order to make sure there was no adverse reactions. At approximately 10:15 10:30 AM the patient drove back home. After driving for about five minutes while stopped at a traffic light the patient completely passed out at 10:45, he was unconscious for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, almost crashed his car and EMT support had to be called. The patient regained his conscience but it took him over a half hour to feel 50% better. Until 8:30 PM 26Mar2021, the patient still felt weak and dizzy and not normal. No treatment was received for events. The outcome of events was recovering.

Staff stayed with the patient until EMS arrived (patient remained conscious and stable).  EMS preformed BGM 146, attached heart monitor, communicated with patient, and walked patient to the rig for transport to escalated care.

                                                Initial symptom was swollen lymph nodes in left armpit--where I got the shot. I am informed enough to know this means I had active antibodies that recognized the virus and attacked it. This lasted approximately 4 days.  After day 2, this began where I am today; occasional vertigo/loss of balance with persistent high blood pressure/headaches consistent with when I contracted Covid 11/2020. I have been to my primary doctor twice. The possibility of this being a vaccine reaction has never come up. It is as if I have the headache/blood pressure portion of Covid infection all over again.    There is no outcome yet. Having read other people&#39;s comments, it is a waste of time and money to get diagnostic tests, and physicians are guessing. No thank you,  I learned of these symptoms and this website from the many internet forums (one is listed above) where people are discussing their vaccine reactions. I never wanted this vaccine, but there is considerable pressure to get vaccinated, even when you contracted the virus. I feel vaccine passports are going to be forced on people. I regret the decision to do this.  My second shot is scheduled for 4/30, but I am cancelling it, I am certain this is Covid vaccine related. I am a very healthy and physically fit 58 year old that eats well. Don&#39;t drink, don&#39;t smoke, mainly vegetarian diet.

Within a few hours, I begin to experience some discomfort and a limited range of motion.  By the next morning, the right side of my neck was stiff. This may have been a result of me unable to sleep comfortably on my right side. I have also been having some slight headaches. Headaches are very rare for me, and these particular episodes do not tend to subside with over-the-counter relief. The oddest thing is my inability to focus visually. I wear corrective eye wear, but mostly for close work and reading. This Saturday, 4/24/2021, I had difficulty reading the subtitles on the television, with or without my glasses.

I had patient elevate his legs. i got cold compresses for his face and some water to drink. He then said he felt like he had to vomit, which he did into our wastebasket. He sat back and his eyes rolled back. I felt he was going to pass out. I had a pharmacy technician call 911 and stayed with the patient until EMS arrived. Patient was checked out and released to go home. I spoke to patient today and he said he was fine after a few hours.

                                                About 17 hours after the shot, preparing to go to my office I suddenly became dizzy in a way similar to an episode of vertigo I had 15 years prior.  I notice I had a headache that got worse in minutes. I sucked down 3 and 1/2 two hundred mg Aleve pills and hit the sack. Four hours later I drank 14 oz of water and took another 2 Aleve since the headache was still strongly with me. My body had a general soreness and an ache. I went back to bed thinking I might need to call my MD. About 3 hrs later, I took more water, ate nothing, took 2 more Aleve, and my wife made a call to schedule an appointment with Dr. I was awakened by my wife for dinner. I had an appetite but was foggy and sluggish. I took two more Aleve skipped any alcohol - and went to bed for the evening. The following morning -  Jan 18th, 2021 - I awoke with no headache, no soreness, no vertigo.

Got moderate (3 to 5 on 10-steps scale) pain in left upper arm/shoulder around 9 pm, limited mobility. Took 2 extra-strength Tylenols.    Between 2 and 3 am woke up because of severe headache (7 to 8), couldn&#39;t normally sleep because of that. Temperature 99.6 F. Another 2 Tylenols about 4 am. Not effective. Drinking a lot of water.    Decided to stay home. Contacted my supervisors by text and e-mail, left a voice message for EH.   8 am - another 2 Tylenols. Tried to sleep - slept till 1 pm. Headache improved (3-5), 99.3 F. Water and tea, minimal activity.    Received instructions from EH - to stay at home if any symptoms will take place, to get COVID test upon returning to the hospital.    Condition was improving during the day. Low pain and discomfort in the evening (2-3).    Sleeping normally during the night. No symptoms in the morning. No reason to delay returning to work.    Took COVID test at 9 am. Negative.    No symptoms since then&#34;

                                                I have had a weekly routine of fasting one day a week for the last 20 years. Sometimes I would extend this to 3 days, water only. I am healthy, 6&#39;1&#34; weight 170-180 all of my adult life. Resting HR &lt;56. 9 days after having my first vaccination, I did a 24 hour fast. I woke at 2 am to go to the bathroom. I became lightheaded and passed out while standing over the toilet. I layed on the floor for over 5 minutes with my head spinning. I then realized I was hypoglycemic. I have never had this issue. I took some orange juice and recovered my strength. I hit my head on the top of the toilet which required my to have 5 sutures in my chin at the ER that night.  Today I was working out for 30 minutes on an elliptical. I work out 4 to 5 times weekly.  10 minutes after returning to my room I noticed I was dizzy and checked my pulse from my watch. My HR was 210. this lasted for over 10 minutes. I have never had this issue.   I believe it would not be in my best interest to take the second vaccination.

                                                Came to Vaccine clinic feeling unwell with headache and lightheadness.  After the vaccine, he was c/o feeling unwell with 9/10 HA, lightheadedness, dizziness.  He noted that his HA/symptoms had been present for 2-3 days prior and he had been taking ASA without relief.  He was HD stable but diaphoretic.  Clinic staff administered glucose gel without effect after he stated that he was diabetic and had only eaten a banana all day.  Because he continued to report feeling unwell and was ill appearing, EMS was called and the patient was taken to local ER.  At local ER he was told his blood pressures were high, and he was given something via IV (unsure what). He reported then that he did not take his blood pressure medication on the date of the vaccine administration because the timing conflicted with the COVID vaccine. He was discharged from ED after four hours and PCP follow up arranged within the week.

                                                Six days after receiving the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a sudden, total loss of hearing in the left ear. This was accompanied by extreme vertigo and loud tinnitus which has not abated.  I have visited an ENT specialist and had three audiology tests, which has confirmed that there is no hearing function in the left ear.  ENT diagnosed as  labyrinthitis due to viral infection. Tried to reduce inflammation and potentially restore hearing function by injecting steroids directly into the ear. These treatments have not worked.   I received the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 4/11/21 as scheduled.

                                                I had the vaccination (my second) and waited the required 15 minutes after the injection.  I felt fine and got on my bike and road home.  I took a longer route (10 miles), and I remember things up to almost the end.  The bike ride ended with a bad fall, I presumably had a syncopal event and crashed my bicycle.  Bad hit on helmet, and I was unconscious for probably five minutes.  I was found and woken up by a passerby (I have no memory of this) and then the EMTs arrived.  Checked into Emergency Room.  They suspected a cardiac event, but I have so far passed all the tests (exercise stress test, echocardiogram, normal QT).  I have *never* had an event like this, the bike ride, while a little long, was quite normal for me.  I also note that I had possibly not had enough to eat or drink that morning.  So, based on the curious timing of this event, I personally believe it&#39;s related to the shot.  I also don&#39;t really believe this is an anxiety related syncopal event (it was more than an hour after the shot), but rather I suspect an immune response, perhaps aggravated by dehydration/lack of enough food.  But who knows?  I was out cold, and don&#39;t remember the minute or so up to the crash.  I did go back to inspect the bikeway that I was on to see if there was anything there that could have caused a crash (tree branches, rough surface) and I found nothing.  It was a pretty flat easy bike path at that point.

The day following my vaccine, my tinnitus became significantly more intense and started &#34;pulsating&#34;.  Best I can describe is the volume of the ringing pulses louder with my heartbeat.  In addition, I had two brief episodes of Vertigo within the past week whereas I normally get them no more than once or twice per year.   I&#39;m unsure at this time whether a second shot will make it unbearable.

He didn&#39;t scratch, said he wanted to pull Band-Aid off and scratch but didn&#39;t do it. He says it cleared up but he&#39;s been feeling a little funny, just maybe a little sick to his stomach, dry mouth, stuff like that. He says he didn&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem, says he had that problem like after 3, 4, or 5 weeks and all of a sudden he has a little episode where he gets to feeling funny, says his judgement is off and the brain things get a little not right. He stated he then fell a lot, says he&#39;s been falling a bunch of times in the last week, he&#39;ll feel better and it won&#39;t bother him. He says it&#39;s a cycle he&#39;s gone through since he lost oxygen. He doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s anything, it&#39;s confusing, says it has so many symptoms, and when he read this it has so many symptoms.  Confirmed patient was referring to COVID vaccine. He states he hasn&#39;t had eczema then most of it, sometimes he&#39;ll scratch, it will build up like a scab and he&#39;ll scrape it off, put some of the ointment on there. but a band aid on top, leave it down for a couple of days, after a shower, a couple of showers, it comes off. He says it clears it up, says if it doesn&#39;t, just wash, wash it hard, it scrubs the scab off.  He states the worst thing he had was his toenails, he had to work on them, had fungus things push under the nail, under the side, and he cut it. He used cortisone 10 on it, says they always quit making something that works well, states you know how you get a yellow toenail. He says he&#39;s been putting Neosporin on it. Clarified corcetin is Cortizone 10, it is pretty strong stuff. He says he puts it on these places on his arm using Neosporin. Attempted to clarify that itching began after use of Cortizone 10, states nothing like that, says it did itch a few days after still a little bit, there were three little places under that Band-Aid where they put the shot. He ended up putting Neosporin right when he took that band aid off it was itching, says he washed it good, then put Neosporin on it, says it&#39;s cleared back up to its normal roughness.  For event itching, he states at first it was almost a scab, but it was not quite a scab, it was wet like a little bubble. After the scab, when he got ready to take, it was itchy after the band aid was on there a couple of days, he took a shower, washed it, and put more ointment on it. Each time he took the Band-Aid off, he washed it, washed his arm, and put the Band-Aid back on. He did the same again and it&#39;s gone away.  He states he is feeling a little bit bad, his stomach is a little bit bad. He hadn&#39;t checked it lately, when he gets a fever, says 98.6 is about a half point to a point high. He was really, really tired, says he slept and slept and slept. Says this is similar to the cycle that he goes through with his brain injury, says it&#39;s the same cycle he goes through. He also stated he lost so much weight laying in bed.
