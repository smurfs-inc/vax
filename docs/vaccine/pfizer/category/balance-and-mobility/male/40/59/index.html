A 40-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the arm on 07Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included clonazepam. The patient had historical vaccine first dose of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced tiredness. On unspecified date, the consumer stated, &#34;I just want to, I didn&#39;t have, I was just little tired with the first shot I received. But I am little concerning on the second one like I woke up at the middle of the night, I got it yesterday at about 13:00. I woke up at about 2:00 in the morning on 08Jan2021 nd I couldn&#39;t even really move but then I was up for most of the night. My temperature is like  between 102.6 and 103.5 and my back hurts really bad. So, I am hoping that these are normal things but I am curious at any point is there something I should watch out for taking on that stuff further. The first shot was not anywhere near to bad which I know is to be expected but the second one being the worse, it&#39;s like dramatic, I have had a fever for I don&#39;t know like eighteen hours. Is there anything I should just make sure, or like this can be a normal side effect, correct?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

He stated that he never gets headaches and was on a pain scale of 7-8 at that time.  Vitals were taken. BP 135/86, pulse 91, temp 96.4. We dosed the patient with 1000mg of Tylenol at 3:05pm.  At 3:15, the patient stated that his headache had increased to a pain scale of 9.  He wasn&#39;t doing well so the staff laid him down.  At this point the staff felt it was a situation that needed more attention.  They took the patient to the ER where he was given saline and something for headache.  The also drew labs. Not sure what labs they drew.

A 40-year-old male patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 21Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), COVID-19 in 2020 (Jun2020 or Jul2020; tested positive for COVID-19 at that time and has 3 tests after that which were all negative) and since then lost weight (2020), and root canal. The patient had no issues with vaccines in the past. There were issues with the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, because he would be positive to TB, but this is because of his culture, he is from a specific country, and so they cannot take that vaccine. The patient clarified that he did not take the TB vaccine, what he meant was he is aware he can&#39;t take it. On 21Dec2020, the patient works in healthcare and had a patient that came in that tested positive for COVID-19 and so because of that, everyone including him that came in contact with the COVID-19 positive patient had to check and get tested. This happened the same day as his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the test (Dec2020) came out negative. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had not had any antibody test for COVID-19. The patient asked the doctor, but she never scheduled him for that, until after last month, she talked to him about it, but by that time he told her that he doesn&#39;t need it now - it&#39;s been almost a year. The patient had the first dose on 21Dec2020 and at that time he did experience symptoms the next day (22Dec2020). At that time after the first dose administration (21Dec2020), he could not lift his arm and it was bruised under the arm. The next day (22Dec2020), he had back pain, with his neck he could not turn it (neck pain), he could not be on his left side where he got the shot on left arm, it was like that for 3 days. Then on Thursday (24Dec2020), he had headache every time he bended his head down, he would be sleeping and would wake up in middle of night because of the headache, it felt like a sinus headache on one side of the head, and when he bend his head down, he would feel it, it stayed this way till 29Dec2020 (Tuesday). The patient has a question trying to find out with his employer. They told them they need to take the vaccine, they pushed them to take the vaccine, he works in healthcare. If they get sick at the job, he asked if they (employer) would pay for it, how would he get paid. The job told him he gets paid sick days and asked how they would do that. The patient asked how long the vaccine was alive in the body and how does it work. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

I have never had a reaction like this to any other shot/vaccines.

My heart began to race and I was lightheaded. I reported the reaction and was given an oximeter to check oxygen and heart rate. Heart rate was 140, oxygen 99. BP was also checked and was normal. Was given water and sat for another 10 minutes. Felt better and heart rate was under 100 until another wave of lightheadedness came over me and heart rate spiked again to over 120. It came down again. A few minutes later lightheadedness came back, shaking started, and heart rate spiked again. It lasted about 10 minutes. After 55 minutes of staying at facility I was able to leave. However, did have one more brief episode of lightheadedness and heart rate spiking. Sore arm and extreme ringing in one ear were only side effect the  following day.

Once he received the vaccine, he became nauseous, sweaty, clammy, dizzy and lightheaded. Pt explained to immunizer that he was switched to night shift and had taken his diabetic meds without food soon before his shift at 5:30pm. An EMT was on scene and she proceeded to call more medics. I checked on the pt and he was vomiting and very pale. Medics checked pt vitals and okayed him for work.

                                                Within few minutes, I started feeling high heart rate and dizzy. Notified health care professional and they took me in to observe vitals. Heart rate and blood pressure was higher than normal. EKG looked normal but with higher heart rate. Started feeling better in an hour and went home. The high heart rate recurred the next several days but would go away after few minutes.  Occasionally I get a headache and feel resting heart rate is higher than before. Definitely feeling better after two weeks compared to day of the shot.

Initial blood pressure was 75/50s, and subsequent monitoring show that his blood pressure was in the  136/85. No itching, rashes, shortness of breath, facial swelling, tongue swelling, or anaphylaxis.

I also had trouble with balance and fine motor skills.  Had some personality changes too: became very moody with erratic mood swings. The next day I slept all day because of exhaustion and aches. When I woke up on Wednesday (36hrs later) I was literally screaming in pain because of how bad my arm and shoulder hurt. It hurt to move it, and hurt not to move it.  It was excruciating and ibuprofen didn&#39;t seem to help at all. Throughout Wednesday I could hardly move my left arm. Getting dressed or washing my hair was very difficult and very painful.  I was also still very uncoordinated. My left armpits lymph nodes were so swollen that (1) it filled in my entire armpit so there was no more pit, just a very soft bulge, and (2) the fluid extended all the way to my chest and it looked like I had one breast and one pec.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

                                                Patient received 2nd dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at 2:04pm , &lt;5 minutes after vaccine administration he developed hypotension with loss of consciousness for few seconds. He was sitting in a designated chair for the protocol 15 min observation and fell from the chair to the ground, hitting the right side of his temporal - redness noted around area with skin intact.

                                                Patient screened for first dose of Pfizer vaccine. He checked no history of allergies or reactions to medications or vaccines. In the initial screening he informed me he had a phobia of needles but this is usually with blood draws. He reported he should be fine with vaccinations. I inquired on previous reactions and he denied any allergic reaction just that he does not like them. I asked him how I can help give the vaccine. We had him look away and to think of a different situation. I asked him if he would like to know when I am administering or just use distraction. He chose to be informed when he would feel a slight poke. Vaccine was administered with no issues.  Within the minute following the vaccine patient started to feel dizzy. Hung his head a bit but was responsive. I requested staff assistance to help the situation including RN to prevent any episodes of syncope.  We provided water which he was able to drink. He was still seated and we suggested putting head between legs. This was not comfortable for him so we moved him to the floor. About 3-4 min in he began to sweat a bit more and appeared Pale. We obtained a BP and pulse. BP was 112/60 and pulse around 60.  When he felt hot, sweaty and appeared pale we all decided to call EMS to be cautious. He maintained BP, no SOB, did not lose conscious. EMS evaluated him, med list provided and vitals. He was on medications for anxiety.  They released him after about 30min and reported a panic attack and not related to the vaccine.  Patient walked out of the clinic with his partner and was stable. He is requesting 2nd dose of the vaccine. I informed him nurse would review and would have a plan for future injection.

Pt verbalized understanding importance of reporting worsening symptoms to PCP and me as well as going to the ED for life threatening symptoms. Pt came back at 4:30PM after signing out and asked to stay in observation. During this time, his symptoms worsened from chills to body aches and dizziness. Gait with assist was unsteady. I brought him down to the ED at 4:50.

By 4:15pm, I was experience acute lower back pain that made it difficult to stand up.  The pain continued for the rest of the evening.  By the morning of Saturday March 13th, the pain had subsided to a tolerable level.  By the morning of Sunday March 14th, the pain subsided even further.  It is now Wednesday March 17th and the pain is not gone although it is much reduced.  I attempted to get an appointment with my PCP to discuss the wisdom of getting (or not getting) the 2nd shot on April 2nd but so far I have been unsuccessful in getting an appointment due to scheduling limitations at the office.

He is a Service Member and reported  high levels of baseline activity, including running 10 miles each Saturday. He received vaccine #1 25 JAN 21 (EN5318) without AE. He received dose #2 on 16 FEB 21, (EN6200). He experienced no immediate symptoms suggestive of IgE event. On day 1 he reports feeling cold, mild fatigue but no other symptoms. On day 2 he was baseline. On day 3 he noted numbness, tightness  and discomfort to his right  calf. On day 4 (Saturday), his usual long run day, he experienced dyspnea and lightheadedness after running 20-30 feet. He states he noted tightness in his calf and instead walked the track while his wife completed her run. He rested day 5.  Day 6 he noted significant edema to his calf, which he describes as double normal in size, and iced it. Day 7, he tried to schedule with PCP and based on triage was sent to ER. ER diagnosed R DVT and bilateral PE&#39;s. He was admitted overnight, started anticoagulation therapy. He saw hematology, and the workup was negative for other causes.

                                                Woke up at 0700 drenched in sweat with chills. Slight fever of 99.7F . Started my work day from home with a meeting at 0900 and knew by 0920 that I had to take the day off.   Spent the entire rest of the day and night in bed. Fever peaked at 101.1F , nausea, constant headache, shaking chills and then sweats, extreme fatigue and full body severe muscle soreness. Light headed and very weak.  I slept all day until almost 1500. When I woke up my fever was gone. I&#39;m left tonight feeling hungry again along with some residual sore muscles and aches.  The fever responded well to Ibuprofen. I hydrated with water and Gatorade.  It pretty much felt like influenza for just under 48 hours. I feel like I&#39;m past the worst of it now, but I&#39;m not fully recovered.

                                                On April 18 and 19, following my 2nd injection, I had very bad chills and could not get warm. I was nauseous although I did not vomit. On April 22, I began having severe sharp stabbing pains just to the right of my belly button. It felt like I was being stabbed with a very hot knife, and after about 15-90 seconds, it would go away. Anytime I reached for something, bent over, twisted, turned or tried to hug someone, I would get this same pain and it would double me over in pain.  On Monday April 26 at 7pm, I finally checked into the Emergency Room  at the direction of my Primary Doctor.  They did a bunch of blood work on me and sent me for a CT Scan of my abdomen.  All of the blood work came back in normal ranges, and the CT Scan showed my appendix was &#34;borderline&#34; according to the surgeon. They consulted with Dr and decided to admit me for a surgical consult and further examination.  They gave me fluids and morphine through an IV for the first 24 - 36 hrs, and then switched to Norco by mouth. I continued having pain throughout my stay.  On Thursday, April 29, they took me to surgery for &#34;exploratory surgery&#34; with the intention of removing my appendix and looking around to see if anything else stood out to them that would cause me this pain.  They stated my appendix had scar tissue on it and they removed it, but said they did not know if this would stop the pain I was having.  On Friday April 30, I was released from the hospital at approximately 6pm.  By 9pm on Friday, I began having those same sharp, stabbing, burning pains in my abdomen again, now to the right of my belly button again and further towards my right side.  I also had sharp burning pain in the inside of my upper right arm, between my bicep and tricep muscles.  This pain continued on through the weekend occurring more frequently and more severe.  On Monday morning at about 1:30am, I woke up with severe abdominal pains all over and went into the bathroom.  I had diarrhea and nausea and felt like I was going to vomit.  Between 1:30am and 7:30am, I went to the bathroom 6 times.  I went to work on Monday and continued having abdominal pains and diarrhea all day and night.  On Tuesday, I went to the bathroom a total of 17 times. On Wednesday, I saw my primary Dr.,  who examined my abdomen and pains.  He suggested I take immodium for the diarrhea and a supplement for muscle pain, as he felt this was the cause of my pain. On Wednesday, I went to the bathroom 21 times and was very nauseaus.  I started the Imodium and it had no effect on me whatsoever.  On Thursday, I had to call off work because I couldn&#39;t stop using the bathroom.  By 4pm, I had been to the bathroom 18 times.  I returned to the ER.  They took a stool sample and did an ultrasound in the ER.  They decided to admit me again for surgical consult and pain management.  On Friday, Dr ordered another ultrasound of my abdomen, specifically my gallbladder, kidney, and liver.  He also sent me for a CT Scan with contrast.  They completed a total lab workup of my blood.  All of these results came back normal, and nothing on the images showed anything wrong with my organs.   On Saturday May 8, Dr came to the hospital to examine me. He stated everything related to my GI was fine.  He asked if I have back pain, which I told him I do.  At this time, I was in extreme pain and I couldn&#39;t even touch my skin. Dr attempted to examine my abdomen, and just by placing his hand on my stomach, I screamed in pain.  He then put his hand behind my back and pushed a little, and it cause extreme pain in my abdomen.  At this time, Dr suggested that maybe the pain is caused by something going on in my back.  Maybe a pinched nerve or something.  He ordered an X-ray of my upper and lower spine.  Later that day, the results of the X-ray came back and showed there was nothing wrong with my spine.  With these results, Dr then ordered an MRI of my lumbar and thoracic spine.  On Sunday May 9 at 1030am, I was taken to radiology for an MRI.  The initial report shows that I do not have any pinched nerves and nothing notable that would cause this type of pain in my body.   As of now, no diagnosis or explanation for the pain I am experiencing. The pain is gradually getting worse and at times I am unable to move at all without extreme severe pain in my body.  At times, my right groin hurts and I am unable to stand on my feet, as it feels as if I have pulled a groin muscle.  The pain in my abdomen takes my breath away and feels like I am being set on fire in that area of my body.  The pain no longer goes away and is constant, but moves throughout my right side from my groin to my shoulder only.  I am not able to put my right arm behind my back because I get this pain in the back of my shoulder area.  This pain is only on my right side at this time.  So far, there is no explanation for this pain.  I never had anything like this until I got the vaccine.

I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

A 42-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL8982 or E68982), intramuscular on 13Jan2021 16:00 at single dose in left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 42 years. Medical history included retinal blood clot in his retina which was why he was tested for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Meniere&#39;s disease for which he was asked to try meclizine which was for inner ear but he did not start taking meclizine, and six years ago, they did blood work and he was told he may have RA or he may have markers for RA but he has had no further issues and does not take any medication for this. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Historical vaccine included  influenza immunisation (flu shot) in Sep2020 and first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231) administered on 22Dec2020 around 15:15 at single dose intramuscular injection in left deltoid, and on 06Jan2021 he started to experience dizziness/feeling dizzy and going to throw up on 11Jan2021. He received the second dose of the Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021 and for the last days it seems that the dizziness is being incrementing, reported as worsened. His physician recommended him to perform laboratory tests and the results came back without abnormal findings except for cholesterol and vitamin D. He was told his cholesterol was a little elevated and his vitamin D was two points low, regarding his lab work. He got a vitamin D supplement which he started to take. He will start on his cholesterol medication today that was prescribed. Reportedly he has a Roomba and when he went to go press the button for it, he just about face planted. He looked online and could not find anything about the dizziness aside from dizziness could be a sign of a severe allergic reaction. He does not have hypotension or anything like that. Dizziness was not resolved, while outcome of other events was unknown. It was stated dizziness is not reported as a side effect of the vaccine.

On Wednesday, I noticed light bruising up and down my arms. Thursday morning around 10 AM, I started to have side effect - some so severe they must be documented. At 10 AM, I felt lightheaded and had brain fog. By noon my head was pounding with a headache followed by an upset stomach. At 2 PM things started getting bad and continued to worse. It was not the headache or stomach that need to be noted but a sudden and severe onset of depression and anxiety. - Depression like I have not felt in years when I was at my worst. Throughout the day the depression worsened and by 7 PM, I was unable to stop crying and was overwhelmed with anxiety and  PTSD panic attacks. While I have the training to understand  this is temporary, - I am very worried about what I?m feeling , because there was no warning or mention of this side effect. I have the resources needed for this but people that are more fragile need to prepare for the sudden o set of critical/ debilitating depression.

I lost all energy and struggled to get out of bed and walk. Laid in bed all day, took Tylenol, slept off and on. Didn&#39;t subside until 6:00pm the next evening when I broke out in a sweat and got some energy back.

When I went to see that patient, he was laying on the floor with his eyes rolled in the back of his head and was unresponsive. He was not alert. He started having a mild seizure and I rolled him over on his left side. While I was bracing the patient, pharmacist came in and administered an Epi-pen to his left thigh. Patient stopped seizing so I rolled him back on his back. He became alert and was able to provide me his name, DOB and what he was at the pharmacy for. I rested my hand under his head and monitored his pulse until the paramedics arrived

                                                Pt was found in severe distress in the bathroom by his wife.  He couldn&#39;t walk or stand, complained of being dizzy with slurred speech and was throwing up a lot. 911 was immediately called. The EMTs during their assessment said his BP was normal but when he was asked his name, he started saying the alphabet&#34;ABC... XYZ&#34;.  He was transported by ambulance to ER. Cat scan showed he had a bleed on the brain.  The doctors told us it was because he had very high blood pressure, however where the bleed was, they said he wouldn&#39;t need surgery and that the body would reabsorb it over time.  He was admitted to the ICU and has been there ever since.  Several days later, he started having difficulty breathing and they discovered several blood clots in his right leg that had broken off into his heart and lungs.  He had emergency surgery to remove the clots in his heart (approximately 10) and was given heparin in small doses over an 8 hour period so that it wouldn&#39;t cause the bleed in his brain to increase.  The doctor should fill in the rest.

                                                10 min after injection, my mouth started getting hot, then it moved down my throat and it was difficult and painful to swallow. I got quite dizzy. They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

The pain gradually increased, became more intense, and more constant.  Mild fever and chills started happening, and I took Ibuprofen.  By about 4 days after the vaccine, the abdominal pain was severe enough that I had some difficulty walking and I couldn?t sleep at night.  Pain was 6-8/10.  I went to the ER, and CT scan with IV contrast showed 18 mm appendicitis.  I underwent laparoscopic surgery and it was found to be perforated.  It was removed.  I am currently recovering in the hospital.  I received the vaccine as a health care provider at my hospital, specifically I am a practicing pediatrician physician for over 10 years.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

                                                I had some sort of reaction.  I was glad to get the shot and was not nervous about getting the shot. 5 minutes after the shot I felt something cold go down my left arm from my shoulder to my hand.  A minute or two after that both my hands went numb, then both my arms went numb.  I asked others around me if anyone felt anything and everyone else was fine.  A minute or two after that both my legs went numb. I started to black out but made it to a chair before this happened,  I drank some cold water and felt awake about 5 minutes later.  30 minutes after that i felt comfortable enough to walk.  For the rest of the day i felt like i was legally drunk and felt lots of pins and needles on the back of my hands and feet. I did not feel dizzy or nauseous at that time. i also felt a lot of pressure on the inside of my skin all over my body. I&#39;ve never felt anything like that and it was a bit uncomfortable.  The next day i was too dizzy to walk without becoming very nauseous.  I still had pins and needles on my feet. i had chills as well which i guess is a good sign.  my appetite was fine. i felt clear-headed as well.  Two days after the shot i felt slightly dizzy and by the third day i felt fine except for minor muscle cramps all over my body.  For the three days after the shot i also had some pretty strong forearm and calf muscle cramps and my arms (biceps and triceps) felt pumped up like i just had a great arm workout, but they weren&#39;t swollen at all.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

After receiving the shot, had him sit in a chair next to the table for a few minutes to see if would occur again.  After about 2 minutes, pt began reporting that he felt that he was about to faint again.  He began to dry heave and passed out momentarily for 2 seconds before coming back to.  Pharmacist caught him before he fell.  Gave pt water and took blood pressure.  Patient began to feel better.  Sat for 30 minutes and then he felt fine to leave.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

During evaluation BP was found to be elevated (160 or 180&#43;/100&#43; approximately (don&#39;t recall exact numbers).  Within an hour subsided enough for me to return to work, and dizziness subsided over the next several days.  Similar reaction to booster dose on 2/16/21; less acute but dizziness continues 1 month later.  Severity is not debilitating at this time.

                                                Severe spinning, nausea, vomiting, occurred at 2:15 a.m. while on duty, was transported to ER and diagnosed with Peripheral Vertigo. Follow ups with ENT, Neuro and PCP have continued with Vestibular Rehabilitation. While in ER, the MRI, MRA, CT, CT with Contrast was done, showed no signs of anything that could have caused this. Ironically tracking back, I received my 2nd Dose of the Pfyzer Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. and this occurred on February 13th at 2:15 a.m. I have not had any other issues before this nor any signs of damage to the nerve or ear that regularly affects Vertigo Patients per my Neuro and ENT. The incident took place 4 weeks and 2 days after the 2nd vaccine. 2 days after the 2nd dose, I experienced Low grade fever, chills, and body aches that lasted only 12 hours, but nothing with the 1st vaccine nor anything after the 2nd dose issue until the Vertigo.  I am unable to drive, conduct my job, which requires me to go to emergency calls and carry a Taser (CEW). I have been off work since this occurred and still not eligible to go back to work.

I sleep at night, and wake up around 2am with sever chills, take 800mg Ibuprofen, and within an hour my chills break and I start feeling better.  The process repeats itself in the afternoon and then again in the evening.  I&#39;m constantly tired and fatigued, and have been unable to exercise or work out since.   I&#39;m still experiencing the symptoms as of today.

                                                I felt light headed, dizzy and I almost passed out approximately 20-25 minutes after the injection. I then took 1 tablet of Claritin in order to counter the reaction. I sat down outdoors, removed my mask and jacket so I could breathe better. I also ate a sandwich since I thought maybe I felt dizzy because I didn&#39;t eat a full breakfast. I stayed outdoors sitting down for 2 hours before getting up. I felt better after about 1 to 1.5 hours. However, as of March 6, 2021, sometimes I have a drowsy feeling like I&#39;m on cold medication. However, I did not take any medication today. Also, for the 1st COVID vaccine I took on 11 Feb 2021, I took 1 tablet of Benadryl, which countered the allergic reaction which is why I did not have symptoms to report for the 1st dose.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

                                                Received  second dose of  Pfizer COVID vaccination on January 9, 2021. At the time of the vaccination he experienced discomfort of  left deltoid (site of injection) as well as paresthesia at the injection site. He also experienced systemic symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias for 24 to 36 hours. Over the course of the next several days he experienced continued significant numbness and weakness in left upper extremity, specifically in left deltoid muscle. By Sunday 1/17/2021 the significant left deltoid weakness and numbness persisted, specifically not being able to lift his arm greater than 45 degrees using his deltoid. He contacted health on 1/17/2021. On 1/19/2021 he had a consultation with a physician. Based upon his clinical examination, and symptom complex, physician does not believe that this is a cervical spine issue but rather a local nerve injury related to the injection site. He was prescribed a steroid taper. Unclear whether this is temporary or permanent issue.

Would sit up and move around and headache would dissipate with 30 minutes.  Am not able to lay on back or on side.  Received booster on 1/26/2021 and have had same  events.  OTC pain killers are not working.  Once I initially wake up I move to recliner and fall asleep.   We have a sleep number bed and have not had this issue in the past, although don&#39;t know if it is the vaccine or a unknown subtle change in day to day activities.

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 45-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL6269), via an unspecified route of administration in Left arm on 04Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 45-years-old) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. 51 hours after receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting down watching a film. His left arm began to tingle, and he felt a wave of dizziness and nausea come over him. He stood up, walked a few steps and sat back down. He broke out in a cold sweat, chills, and saw stars. He leaned forward with his head in his hands, and apparently fainted for a moment and lost control of his bladder. All events started on 06Feb2021 06:00 PM. No treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Feb2021. No covid prior vaccination, no Covid tested post vaccination, no known allergies.

He reported that after returning home he has dizziness and weakness that lasted 45 minutes and then resolved without treatment.  He did not seek care. On the day of his second shot (2/22/21) he said he had not taken his blood pressure medication that morning.  His blood pressure was143/98 and pulse 70 prior to vaccination.  At 10 minutes after the injection he reported feeling dizzy and having shortness of breath and feeling dry mouth.  His O2 sat was 98%.  Pulse had increased to 82 and then several minutes later was 110.   He was placed on a monitor but a large size cuff was not available at the vaccination site.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine  Approx 8 hours after receiving the vaccine, I suddenly became slightly dizzy and moderately nauseous.  I also became very tired even though I was well rested.  The nausea and dizziness lasted approx 2-3 hours.  At that time I developed moderate injection site pain.  I was very fatigued for the remainder of the night and through the next day (6 Jan).  I was no longer fatigued as of 7 Jan but starting that morning I had a very difficult time focusing mentally.  That condition lasted until late on the evening of 7 Jan.  As of 8 Jan, all symptoms have resolved and I feel fine.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after receiving my second COVID shot and right before I went to bed at 10pm I started getting chills.  My symptoms worsened as the night went on, I was shaking and could not get warm.  I also had a very bad headache and I had trouble lifting myself up.  At about 3am I started sweating and feeling feverish.  I got out of bed to take Tylenol and drink water, and had trouble walking and I was breathing heavy.   At 6am I decided to take a hot bath with Epsom salts to help with my aches and headache.  When I got out of the bath I felt very dizzy and fatigued and need assistance from my wife to get back in bed.  At about 9am I started feeling better.  I sat myself up and ate apples and salty tortilla chips and drank lots of water.  By 1pm I was able to walk without difficulty and I felt better with only a mild headache.

Over the next hour, it traveled superiorly up to his left cheek and to the inferior ear. He had a steroid and antihistamine sent in to the pharmacy and took this once he got home about 1930. Shortly thereafter, he started developing tongue numbness. He woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and reports he nearly fell into the bathroom wall due to the intensity of vertigo he was experiencing. The vertigo worsened throughout the day and he is very unsteady on his feet, requiring assistance and support from his wife to ambulate. He is unable to drive and reports exacerbation of dizziness when moving his head side to side. His wife reports he had a fever throughout the night 01/10/2021-01/11/2021. He feels the left eye is dryer and a bit weaker than usual and he has had to administer drops to help keep it moist.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 46-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 12:15 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization.

The patient went to bed around 11 pm and woke up the next day (14Jan2021) at around 6:30 am with very bad dizziness. He felt like his eyes were rolling around in his head which made him very nauseous and sick to his stomach. His wife called a friend who is a nurse and she said to keep an eye on him for a little while and see how he was in an hour or so. She said that if it gets worse call 911 otherwise get him to the clinic at 10 am. He reported that he was feeling much better by then but went to clinic at 10 and doctor saw him asked questions gave me something for nausea and dizziness. He felt good the rest of the day with slight lightheaded. He mentioned that he needs get his second shot on 03Feb2021 and was concerned about getting it. He inquired on what is the recommendation on getting dose #2. It was not reported if the patient been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.

I was vomiting with intense force but nothing was coming up. My abdomen was bloated to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand upright and breathing was very painful. I was in that condition for about 12 hours before the swelling began to lessen. Now, 2 days later, I am still unable to eat and drink as normal and have moderate gastrointestinal discomfort with bloating.

We put the patient on the floor and elevated his legs and feet. His color came back to normal. Paramedics were dispatched because of his underlying medical condition. Paramedics checked his blood sugar and it was 145. Patient became very dizzy again when paramedics helped him to sit in a chair so patient decided to go to hospital with them to be checked out.

                                                On March 25, 8 days after the vaccine shot in my left arm, I began experiencing intense pain on the left side of my neck and head. By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

                                                Very minor light headedness the day after injection; typical sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 09:30 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high BP and Pre-diabetic, both from unknown dates. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergies. The patient experienced very minor light headedness the day after injection on Jan2021. It lasted throughout the day. Also reported typical sore arm on Jan2021. Neither of which required any medical attention. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient complained of feeling light-headed and a little dizzy at 10 minutes post-administration.  Pulse-oximetry applied revealed normal spO2, but tachycardia to 140bpm (this patient&#39;s resting HR is approximately 55-65).  Apple Watch data confirmed rapid increase in HR at that moment.  BP increased from normal baseline to about 150-160 SBP.  No chest pain reported.  No signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis (rash, wheezing, etc.).  HR gradually recovered to normal levels within 30 minutes and patient was released after 60 min observation.  Patient reported generalized fatigue in weeks following injection.   Nineteen (19) days after injection, patient developed unprovoked resting tachycardia to approximately 180bpm (following some moderate weigh-lifting exercise).  Symptoms did no resolve sufficiently and patient was transported by EMS to ER for evaluation

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

I also experienced headache, vertigo, chest heaviness, vertigo, and chills for 3 days  following the vaccine.  Still have the ringing.  I cancelled the 2nd vaccine.

This 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; borderline diabetes. Concomitant medications included losartan; alirocumab (PRALUENT, injection) on 20Jan2021. Since 23Jan2021, patient was dizzy all along and almost fainted and was still having symptoms of mild migraine and he don&#39;t know like some light sensitivity. Doctor believed it was from vaccine. Patient was wondering how long was this going to be last as he had second shot coming out. He didn&#39;t think it was an adverse reaction and he thought he should get the second shot. But this was continuing to me and it had already been two weeks and patient still having symptoms of mild migraine. Patient was worried about taking the second shot as a result. He had never had a migraine before and was told it was probably from the vaccine and that was not something he wanted to hear. Patient wanted to know if this was normal to still be having this side effect for this long. Patient was taking acetaminophen (for migraine), it was not a TYLENOL, it was from a different brand. Patient did liver and cholesterol test and blood test in Jan2021 at Cardiologist and they came back fine, nothing was found there. The outcome of event migraine was not resolved. The outcome of rest events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Within a half hour, I felt dizzy and light headed. in 45 minutes - I could barely stay awake. I had to stop driving. Within two hours, I had a bad headache. I became slightly agitated that day. The headache lasted throughout the day - I took Ibuprofen but that didn&#39;t help much. Sunday, the headache was still there. It wasn&#39;t a migraine; but intense. I was agitated.  My agitation level grew and my irritability grew and the headache I had the whole day. Sunday evening about 7 pm the agitation and irritability got very intense - I was having impulse control issues with it. I don&#39;t have anger issues but I wanted to yell at TV or throw my phone. From 8- midnight, I was lethargic and fatigued - I didn&#39;t have the energy to roll over;: had extreme anxiety I was sweating and having weird thoughts like harming my animals and harming myself; my  mind was racing and then I would get really depressed. Until about midnight, I have had past struggles with anxiety and depression - there had been a past feeling like this - but it was really extreme - it was worse night of my life. Lasted four hours, and finally I slept for about one hour. I remember thinking, I finally can take a breath. My racing thoughts were gone and sweating was gone. The irritability had subsided enough that I could try to gain control of my thoughts again. I had really bad nightmares the rest of that night; I was confused _ I didn&#39;t know where I was - confused about that - occurred about three different times until I got up at 5:30 am for work. To summarize, for the next week, I had moments of anxiety and depression. I had mental fog. I played pro football - and I had post concussion syndrome. It was very identifiable to what I had had. So this was occurring in moments - forgetful; depressed; and random moments of anxiety - like I was going to go play football again. 7-10 days - it got a little better each day. Ten days it took to subside. I still exercised and taking extra fluids to get back to my normal.  Exercised help. No fever occurred. With COVID - I had had a sense of anxiety and depression and some mental fog when I had COVID I didn&#39;t have it to this extreme.  Did not get the second dose.

ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.  Completed 5 day course of high dose steroids, 6 days of IVIG and on ongoing PLEX. Neurological improvement noted 3/25

I expected my shoulder to be sore as typical with previous vaccines I have received.  After dinner my should was very very sore and painful, but in a different way than I had experienced before.  The pain feels like it is in the joint rather than in the muscle.  The pain will subside if I keep my shoulder immobile and take Tylenol.  If I use my arm/shoulder the pain returns and worsens with use.  My range of motion is limited and becomes worse with use.   I will wait until the end of the weekend and seek medical treatment if this does not resolve.

Denies abdominal pain but feels nauseated and has been vomiting off and on all day. No other GI sx. Pt has known hiatal hernia but doesn&#39;t take anything for GERD right now because he doesn&#39;t have heart burn sx. Denies chest pain. Gets sweaty randomly and chilled, but this is more chronic.

Gave patient zofran, prilosec, carafate for suspected gastritis sx. Recommended he come get labs in the morning as well. Pt agreed.  4/1 ER HPI: 47 y.o. male who presents with complaints of nausea vomiting abdominal pain ongoing now for the past day reports that is better with rest worse with movement denies any other complaints issues  4/1 Admission HPI: 47 y.o. male that was recently diagnosed with Parkinson&#39;s disease.  He presented to the emergency room with the a several day history of fluctuating blood pressure and nausea/vomiting and generally feeling very poorly.  He has been having a lot of new onset health issues lately and so his wife and family were concerned.  He was brought into the emergency room.  He denies any severe abdominal pain.  However, he states he has been feeling extremely nauseous.  He is vomited at least once a day for the last 5 days.  He does admit that he is under an extraordinary amount of stress between his new onset Parkinson&#39;s, his insurance business, and his full-time job as a pastor.  The patient also does have a history of alpha-gal allergy.  He states it is possible he ate some cross contaminated meat, but states that this nausea and vomiting does not act like his typical response to eating something that he is allergic to.   The patient states that about a month and a half his neurologist did increase his Requip up from 0.5 mg 3 times a day to 1.5 mg 3 times per day.  However, it has never made him nauseous before.  He denies any definite chest pain.  He denies any exertional dyspnea.  He does admit that his blood pressure has been fluctuating for quite some time.  He states he was having a skin biopsy done last week and they almost abandon the procedure because his blood pressure was so high.

                                                I received the first dose of Pfizer EK5730 at 18:07 on 12-30-2020.  For the first day my arm was a bit sore but nothing to bad.  The next few days 48-72 hours later I started to have many more  symptoms, some minor to sever including joint pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.  lesser included some nauseas.   The joint pain was so bad at one point i had to pull over while driving.  on 1-2-21.  as of writing this now 14 days out I still have some joint pain especially in my arms.  No other symptoms of note.   I would add that I tested positive for COVID -19 on 10-18-2020 and was not released from quarantine until 11-5-20  I did seek treatment during this time through by calling my Dr. did not require any hospitalization.

Staff recommended he take an ambulance to hospital as a precaution so he agreed to go.

The throwing up only happened that morning but the dizziness continued. The dizziness happened when I turned my head to quickly or bent over.   After the second dose (taken at 2:30pm on 2/11/2021) I have dry heaved nearly every morning since. I&#39;m not throwing up anything but the dry heaving happens nearly every morning and continues to even today (3/2/2021). I don&#39;t feel nauseous even though I dry heave... which seems strange. I still feel like I have vertigo, which I did not have prior to taking the COVID19 vaccine.

Pain requires walking with a limp. Second shot was in left arm and knee joint pain occurred in the right knee approximately 18 hours after.   I now find it difficult to walk normally on both knees. Pain at times is 7/10.  No previous knee issues.

Tried warm shower and OTC Meds but no change.  It was no better Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.  Went to hospital ER on Sunday 3/22 for x-ray etc. and diagnosed with calcification tendinitis.   Received 800mg Ibuprofen script.  Feeling slightly better today with more range of motion but still cannot lift arm much.  Still very painful at the core of the joint.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I got up in the morning of 01/27/21 to get ready for work and feel light headed if I turn my head or try to walk normally and when I started to get into my car. I didn?t feel it was safe to drive so I didn?t.  Still having body aches this morning as well. But the light headedness is new. I didn?t feel that with the first vaccine dose.

                                                At about 2am on 2/10/21, Patient got up from bed and fell down a flight of stairs. He was initially bleeding and unconscious and was brought by EMS to the hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital he had a temperature of 40 C. He was found to have 2 small left temporal hemmorhagic contusions on CT scan. He had a seizure during the hospitalization. He was initially treated for HSV encephalitis but it is not clear if that was confirmed. The hospital team may not have known of the recent vaccination. He improved during the hospitalization, but remained with a very unsteady gait. He could not return to the group home. He was transferred to a rehab facility to receive PT on 02/16/2021. He remains at rehab. Prior to the fall, on the 3rd day after vaccination, on 2/8/21 at about 10 am, the patient coughed and had a small blood on the inside of his face mask while at his day program. He was seen by his PCP and had no abnormal findings. He had a CBC, BMP and CXR and all were unremarkable.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

I hit my head on a chair when I was falling and cut my head. I stayed laying down because I was still dizzy and hot. They called the squad and did vitals and I was fine. I sat there for about another half an hour and I went home. I have felt fine ever since. Only thing that hurt was my head from the fall.

                                                I was given the first shot and sent to an observation room. I felt slightly flushed, it went away. By the evening, I started to feel flushed again. I commented to my wife that I felt like my blood pressure was up. (I don&#39;t have high blood pressure). That is the best way I can describe it. I can&#39;t recall if the ringing in my ears was noticeable at that time. My the next day I could still feel the flushed feeling and the ringing  was clearly noticeable and increased over time, until it can overcome TV or someone speaking to me. I also had a feeling of persistent light headedness. About Feb 3 I had pain in my ear and went to a clinic. I was diagnosed with a minor ear infection (right). I was given and took a course of anti-biotics. The infection went away but the ringing never did, sometimes it would lessen, but always louder than prior to the shot. I went ahead and took the second shot on Feb 11, thinking my problem was probably and ear infection. I the ringing could get so loud it would wake me up and keep me awake. On Feb20 I woke up to very loud ringing, nausea, and general feeling of unease. I went to a clinic the next day. I was told there was probably some inflammation and was given a steroid shot. After about 4 hrs the ringing lessened and I felt better, the first relief I had from the start. On Feb 23, I saw my ENT Dr. He gave me a course of steroids and ordered a brain MRI. The MRI came back with negative results...no abnormal indications. The ringing is starting to increase again as of the last several days.

A 52-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6205, Expiry date: Jun2021), via intramuscularly to the left arm on 26Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included Hypertriglyceridaemia ongoing. Concomitant medication included Fenofibrate. The patient previous vaccination included Shingrix used for shingles and experienced with sore arm. The patient lab test included Sar-cov-2 which was negative. Patient reported that he received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech covid vaccine on 26Feb2021. He is due for his second dose this Friday 19Mar2021. He is calling because he experienced lymphadenopathy- explains he experienced Lymph node pain/tenderness around his left clavicle. Caller clarified that the injection was on his left side. The pain/tenderness occurred the next day, 27Feb2021 and it was self limiting and it lasted about 5-7 days. He didn&#39;t think anything of it, everything else was ok, the arm pain resolved after one day. On 12Mar2021, he developed similar pain on the right side, but it was a more intense pain/tenderness and lasted maybe 4 days. He still experiences it, but less frequently. He is not sure if he is describing it correctly. During the afternoon, it gets a bit more tender. He doesn&#39;t feel it in the morning, but by the afternoon he notices the pain/tenderness. He did not know if there were any reports of contralateral lymphadenopathy (lymph node pain). He clarified that there is no redness or lump- he doesn&#39;t feel anything, even if he touches it there&#39;s no pain, but periodically there will be a shooting tenderness. He feels like it&#39;s getting better, but it is still persisting. He clarified that on the right side- he is experiencing pain near the axilla, underneath the arm next to the chest. He is waiting to see if it is improving and doesn&#39;t know how long he should wait. He stated that it wasn&#39;t that painful on the left side, it was just a little tender; he knew something was different. The pain wasn&#39;t always there. Sometimes there&#39;s a little pain on the left side still, but not as intense as the right side. The pain is there, it&#39;s not worsening but it is not improving. The patient also reports joint stiffness around neck and shoulder and describes discomfort as ongoing intermittent tenderness. The reporter reported events Lymphadenopathy-Lymph node pain around left clavicle, Lymphadenopathy-Lymph Node Pain/tenderness on right side- near the axilla, underneath the arm next to the chest to be serious due to Medically significant. The outcome of events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts needed.

By afternoon of 12 JAN 21 experienced sudden onset loss of bladder control for first time in his life, followed a few hours later by blurry vision, vertigo, motion sickness, emesis and cold sweats that drenched his clothes. Taken to  ER by paramedics, and admitted  for further observation and evaluation for underlying neurologic vs. cardiogenic problems. Given positional treatments by PT for possible otoliths.  Feels much improved on afternoon of 13 JAN 21, but symptoms not fully resolved. Will likely be discharged from hospital on 14 JAN 21 if problems continue to resolve.

About 10 minutes later, as I was driving home, I had an odd taste in my mouth and my right cheek started to go numb.  I arrived home and started looking for answers (Pfizer information page that lists side effects).  The sensation lasted about an hour or so, then started to subside.  By the time I went to bed, there was just a little tingle at the edge of my cheek bone. Other than being tired and a bit woozy, I feel better today.

                                                Following vaccination, patient felt achy and mildly feverish. During the night, he got up to use the restroom and felt palpitations and lightheadedness, which persisted during the morning. A colleague at work evaluated the patient&#39;s pulse, noting it to be irregular and fast, so patient went to the ED for evaluation. EKG was performed and patient was found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation. Patient was given fluid boluses, 10mg IV diltiazem, and a diltiazem infusion, during which the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm. After stabilization, he was discharged with new prescriptions for metoprolol tartrate 25mg BID and apixaban 5mg BID, to follow up with cardiology.

When he came home he complained of numbness and loss of strength in his left arm and as the next hour progressed he began experiencing numbness in his left hip and decreasing strength in his left hand. I called a medical professional who told me to take him to call an ambulance or take him to the nearest hospital. We arrived at the hospital at 2:30pm and symptoms persisted. By the time we arrived his blood pressure had jumped to 185/114  (This morning before the shot he had self monitored his BP @ 128/80)

                                                Blood clots in right leg below knee; he passed out from pain; pain in his right knee; he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all; knee was swollen; couldn&#39;t walk/limping around; his knee more stiff; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 53-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 21Mar2021 at 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing Factor V Leiden heterozygous, allergies to mushrooms from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and a torn meniscus in his right knee and he had surgery 3 to 4 years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Cephalexin and Percocet and experienced allergies. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested post vaccination. On 22Mar2021 at night around 2:30AM, the patient woke up and started walking to the bathroom and he passed out from pain. He had pain in his right knee. He thought he had torn his knee again. He had surgery 3 or 4 years ago for a torn meniscus in his right knee and he thought he had torn his meniscus again. He passed out, his wife found him and he went back to bed. In the morning, his knee was still very very sore, he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all. He took an Advil between 6:30AM and 8:00AM. He hadn&#39;t taken any medications prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. His knee was swollen but the pain was manageable. He couldn&#39;t walk, he was on crutches for about 24 hours then the swelling started coming down and he put a brace on his knee. He could then walk without the crutches but it was still painful. The next day he had pain in the back of his knee. He thought the pain was caused because he had put the brace on and had been using the crutches. Like he had made his knee more stiff from not using it. He was limping around and the pain was bearable. At that point, the pain was maybe a 4 on a scale of 1-10 where his pain had been a 9 on a scale of 1-10. He took another Advil and he realized the pain in the back of his knee wasn&#39;t going away. He went to see his family doctor and his doctor was able to get him in that same day for an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed 2 blood clots behind his right knee. The patient had blood clots in right leg below knee. The week of the report, he got an appointment with a hematologist. The hematologist reviewed his case and the doctor isn&#39;t 100% sure the blood clots were from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine but the doctor isn&#39;t ruling it out either because it happened within 24 hours of receiving his first COVID-19 dose. He hadn&#39;t done anything strenuous before getting the COVID-19 vaccine, nothing that he thinks would have caused the blood clots. He would like to add, what he thinks is relevant, is that he is positive for Factor V. He reports he has one copy and Factor V only impacts about 3% of the population. The hematologist thought that he might be prone to developing blood clots. The hematologist reports that he has had patients who have had the COVID-19 virus who have developed blood clots. Maybe it&#39;s possible that the COVID-19 antibodies were trying to build up his immune system to COVID-19 and it created something similar to having the COVID-19 virus. If he is predisposed to blood clots then the COVID-19 vaccine may have precipitated the blood clots. His second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for Sunday, 11Apr2021. He had talked to both his family doctor and his hematologist and they both thought he should be ok in getting the second COVID-19 vaccine. He was prescribed blood thinners. If the second COVID-19 vaccine caused more blood clots the blood thinners would help him. He was asking if there is any additional information or guidance on receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine after his reaction. The pharmacist told him that the COVID-19 vaccine trials were all done in the left arm. He received his vaccine in his right arm and his right knee was affected. If he gets the second COVID-19 vaccine he&#39;s getting it in his left arm. He was prescribed Eliquis 5mg take one tablet twice daily. The outcome of the event blood clots in right leg below knee was recovering while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) in left arm on 19Jan2021 08:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma and high cholesterol; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included simvastatin. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient experienced events as stated, &#34;like I was seeing tunnel vision and a little woosy&#34; on 19Jan2021 13:00. No treatment was given to the patient for the events. The outcome of  the events was recovered on unspecified date. The events were considered non serious as it did not result in death, was not life threatening, did not cause/prolonged hospitalization, were not disabling/Incapacitating and were not a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

On the first dose I got these Symptoms at 11:30pm then they subsided by 6:30 am with multiple doses of Tylenol.  I was able to return to work the next day.  The second night the symptoms returned around 11:00 and persisted until morning.  They went away with more Tylenol and all but the injection site pain did not return. On the second dose I had the same symptoms The same night as injection.  They did not go away with Tylenol, and continued through the entire next day.  Fever never broke.  Unable to go to work with fever over 100.  All symptoms persisted through the next night until morning when fever finally broke, and I was able to go to work.  That night the symptoms return overnight, but were gone in the morning, and all but the injection site pain did not return.  It has been 5 weeks since the first injection, and two weeks since my second, and I still have injection site pain and weakness in both of my arms.  It is not as severe as the first five days following injection, but still persistent and noticeable.

I lost 6 pounds.  After continuing with some diarrhea all day on February 12th, I began having bloody mucous chunks as my stool.  I was advised by my doctor to go to the ER.  I was diagnosed with colitis in the ER and was admitted for several days for treatment due to the severe blood coming out.  CT scan showed severe inflammation, and stool sample showed blood and lactoferrin marker high.  I was given many antibiotics and fluids and was released home on February 14th, 2021.  I am still receiving treatment with oral antibiotics, and appointments with my physician.  I had to be absent from work for over 7 days.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EN6201), via an unknown route, on 12Feb2021 (at 12:45) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Relevant medical history included atrial fibrillation from Jun2020, ablation surgery for atrial fibrillation on unknown date, ongoing atrial tachycardia, and ongoing premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Past drug history included allergy to penicillin. Relevant concomitant medications included vitamin NOS, mineral NOS (MEGA MEN) and amino acids NOS, carotenoids NOS, herbal NOS, hyaluronic acid, methylsulfonylmethane, minerals NOS, vitamins NOS (GNC MEGA MEN SPORT). Within approximately two minutes of receiving the shot, he felt a warm sensation travel from the left shoulder area to his chest/upper stomach, his eyes burned, he could taste something, and his heart rate became rapid at a steadily increase amount. He watched his heart rate tick up on her watch to approximately 113 BPM. His normal resting heart rate was upper 60s. He felt dizzy and out of it for about 30 minutes. He felt like he had tunnel vision and lost speed sensation in the car he was driving. His pulse stayed at 92-94 BPM for approximately two hours. He wasn&#39;t anxious about getting the shot and had actually been looking forward to it. The patient was not treated for the events. The patient had recovered from &#39;felt dizzy&#39; on 12Feb2021 while the remaining events resolved in Feb2021.

                                                Patient was nervous prior to the vaccination. Once he received the vaccine he asked to use the bathroom and while he was in there he felt nauseous and came out of the bathroom. He then felt extremely light headed and nauseous that he almost collapsed to the floor. The pharmacist and myself (an immunizing pharmacy intern) rushed to check on him. He reported a little difficulty breathing but was still conscious. We proceeded to call 911 and gave one dose of 0.3 mg Epi-pen. After about 5 minutes he felt much better and was able to sit up. He reported that he never lost complete consciousness but was extremely nauseous and lightheaded. Patient handed over to EMS.

He was able to sit back down. No falls or trauma to his head or any part of his body. He was placed on a stretcher to a private section of the arena and monitored. Initially, his blood pressure was 103/69,  and interval blood pressure 20 minutes later was 139/73.  He was given water to drink, which he tolerated.

I again had ringing in my ears that was intermittent for several weeks.  On March 15th,  I have had non-stop ringing in my ears for the last five days.  I also am experiencing dizziness and slight off-balance due to the ringing in my ears.  I do not have any cold or fly symptoms and feel fine with the exception of the ringing in my ears.

I did not have trouble breathing or swallowing. Very similar to what has happened to me sometimes getting blood drawn but happens at time of appointment not after.  Reclined, deep breaths and started to feel better within 10 minutes.  An hour later feeling much better.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

                                                Patient received first dose of Pfizer vaccine 3/24/21. Patient became unsteady and was directed to stretcher. Patient has a hx of HTN and reports not taking his BP medication for &#34;a while.&#34; Patient was unsure what BP medication he was on. Reports potentially taking Lasix and Vit K. Patient reports not eating or drinking prior to receiving the vaccination. Alert and oriented. Denies SOB/chest pain.     Vitals taken at 10:45AM:  BP 197/11  HR 75 SPO2 98% RA   ED rapid response called. Pt unable to stand up from stretcher.   Patient was taken to ED and neurology was consulted.  Neurology noted:  55-year-old man past medical history of hypertension coming with uncontrolled hypertension systolic over 220.  Concern for gait instability, no evidence of strength weakness on any extremity with confrontational testing.  No evidence of change in altered mental status, no evidence of cranial nerve palsy, and no evidence of sensory loss.   No evidence of coordination problems with finger-to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing bilaterally.  He exhibits 5 out of 5 confrontational testing to all extremities muscles as above albeit with giveaway weakness.  NIHSS 0.     Although patient presents within TPA window he has had no disabling symptoms and therefore is not a candidate for TPA.  Although the patient presents with a mechanical thrombectomy window he has no disabling symptoms and no evidence of LVO either on exam or my preliminary read of his CTA head and neck.  As such he is not a candidate for mechanical thrombectomy.   Symptoms do not localize well although patient presents with clear hypertensive urgency versus hypertensive emergency.  Would recommend full medical work-up for this condition as we rule out signs of acute ischemic stroke.   Patient passes dysphagia screen in the ED.  Recommendation: 1. Admit to Observation.  2. MRI brain without contrast 3. Obtain stroke labs A1c, TSH, lipid profile 4. PT OT consult evaluation and treat 5. Social worker and case management consult for stroke work-up

A 55-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Mar2021 00:30 (lot number: ENG6199) (at age 55 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization administered in a pharmacy or drug store. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication included tramadol taken for numbing shot for tooth, start and stop date were not reported. No other vaccines received in four weeks. The patient experienced the following with his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Shot was painful and in about 15 to 20 minutes later everything felt fine. But by the time he and his wife drove out of town, he started to get HOT with the sweats, terrible headache, dizziness and started to lose his vision. He pulled over to let his wife drive and by the time he got out of the car he could barely navigate to the passenger side.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer reported that her 56 years-old male son (patient) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation on 24Mar2021. Relevant history and concomitant drugs were unknown. The reporter stated that her 56 year old son received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine a day earlier than she received hers (which was on 25Mar2021) and while waiting after getting his vaccination, her son became &#34;very, very dizzy.&#34; He told the nurse working at the vaccination site that the dizziness was getting worse and &#34;getting very bad.&#34; He was asked how his breathing was and he told the nurse it was okay, but an ambulance was called for him anyways and he was sent to the hospital. Her son reported feeling better when he laid down but still reported feeling dizzy. At the hospital, her son was told that all the test came back okay. When her son got up to use the restroom with the assistance of the doctor, the doctor told him that he was dehydrated and gave him IV fluids. Caller stated that her son reported feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; after the IV fluids but &#34;couldn&#39;t hardly walk&#34; and had to have someone else drive him. Her son reported feeling &#34;alright&#34; the next day. Caller stated that she was reading in the information pamphlet on the Pfizer vaccine that a severe reaction could include dizziness. Caller was worried about her son getting his second dose and think she should speak with his physician before receiving his next dose, and would like to know if this was okay. She was concerned because she states that she had heard that people have gotten sick from the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was resolving. Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

It&#39;s worse when getting up out of a chair or bed, but also feel it when just staying still.   I can still function, but it is strange.  Also: a  day after the second shot (Day 2), I got &#34;sick&#34; for two days  (Day 2 and 3)-- sluggish, exhausted, unable to focus.  Spent two days in bed.  But was fine by Day 4..  Then the dizziness started on Day 8.

                                                Sore arm at injection site; Slightly dizzy for about 1 h after vaccination; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself).  57-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 12Feb2021 09:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 12Feb2021, the patient experienced sore arm at injection site (24 to 48 h post injection) and was slightly dizzy for about 1 h after vaccination. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at a workplace clinic. Treatment was not received for the events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered. Case was reported as non-serious.

                                                I had my first shot of Pfizer vaccine last Friday morning (March 5). In the evening, I felt fatigued. So I went to sleep early. When I got up Saturday morning, I felt dizzy. The dizziness went away in a few minutes. In the next 36 hours, I had the angina feelings - tightness in the left chest and I felt heart be squeezed occasionally. When I stand up and walk, I felt better. Finally Sunday evening (March 7), I took a walk outside and felt symptom free. Maybe the walk helped, maybe the &#34;thrombosis&#34; had run its course before my walk.   I have not had the severe angina symptoms since my PCI procedure in Feb 2018. I am sure the recent occurrence is related to the vaccine.   Besides reporting the adverse event, I want to get advices whether I should receive the second shot.   Thank you!

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.

This is the second of two reports. The reporter describes events following both vaccinations in a vaccine series. This report is for those events which occurred following the second vaccination.      A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3249), intramuscularly on 01Feb2021  (at the age of 57-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia from an unknown date. The patient&#39;s historical vaccinations included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 after which he experienced inflammation, joint pain and burning sensation in the joints. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The vaccination was administered at a hospital. Concomitant medications included acetaminophen (TYLENOL), tamulosin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) all from unspecified dates and for unknown indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Per the reporting physician, he got his first vaccine on 22Dec2020.  His MCP and PIP joints and SI joints started burning close to 3rd week in Jan2021. He had some minor SI pains intermittently before but none with hands. Continued hurting enough that he started taking Osteobiflex and fish oil and more tylenol for inflammation. After second vaccine on 01Feb2021 the symptoms he experienced after the first dose have been getting worse.  He mentioned that his hands burn all the time, at times like tonight bad enough that they keep him awake.  He has red nodular areas on some of his knuckles and a distinct nodule at the proximal ulnar aspect of my left 4th finger PIP that is uniformly erythematous. Not all knuckles have the same degree of burning, but all including thumbs have it. The SI joint pain is more variable and at time does not bother him, but the hands get swollen and tight to close everyday. He plans to start some prednisone tomorrow due to the progression of the burning. The clinical outcomes of the events burning sensation in joints worsened, swelling of hands, stiffness joints, inflammation, condition worsended, erythema, nodule on extremity were reported as not recovered. The outcomes of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administration and off label use were unknown.  It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021154881 Same patient, same drug, different AE, different dose of vaccine.

A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

This 58-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot # EI0142, expiry date Mar2021), intramuscular once to the left deltoid, on 28Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 58-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included an antihypertensive medication taking for several years. On 28Dec2020 the patient experienced side effects including sore deltoid (lasted for 2 days, Dec2020), and on 01Jan2021 the patient experienced upper bicep pain which he felt 5 days later (his friend said it may be lymphadenopathy).  The caller had the COVID vaccine on 28Dec2020, and from 28Dec2020 he had a sore deltoid for a couple days, but then almost a week later developed, he thought it was tendonitis, it was the upper part of his bicep, really he could not extend his arm all the way, it was so painful in that area, and it&#39;s still somewhat painful, but better. The sore deltoid was pretty much after the shot and into the next 48 hours, that went away, then he noticed this soreness around the upper part of his bicep, not until, probably, maybe 5 days later, on 01Jan2021. He was chatting with someone, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, that person felt it was lymph nodes, so maybe, there is possibility, caller thought this was muscle pain, as it hurts when he tried to extend his arm, it does not hurt when sitting here, but when he extends, especially over his head, it is really quite painful but it&#39;s lessened, he thought it was a tendonitis, but it could be the lymph nodes active or enlarged, he is not sure, he has never noticed lymph node pain, so he never knew what it was.  Causality for soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as yes. He is pretty sure, since he has not done anything that aggravated that muscle, he can&#39;t think of anything, and it is in the general vicinity of the injection. States he is on an antihypertensive medication, but has been taking it for several years. He doesn&#39;t want to go through a report for the person he spoke to, who mentioned soreness in the underarm area, but it is interesting: the caller told him that had soreness, caller knows he also did report it, he reported it to Pfizer, actually he doesn&#39;t know if it was Pfizer or Moderna, but he reported it to whichever company, and said he thought was inflamed lymph nodes, so that was the first time he thought it was not muscle, but maybe the lymph node&#39;s reaction to vaccine, he has never experienced this kind of discomfort, he could not straighten his arm, as he would straighten the pain was at the upper insertion at the bicep, so that is where he came to this conclusion, his preliminary conclusions, he never thought it would persist this long. He thought, as time went by, it would be better tomorrow, and it has gotten better, but has not gone away.  Sore deltoid was reported as non-serious while soreness around upper part of bicep was reported as serious medically significant because it has persisted for so long, he would have not expected it to keep going on, but it is almost going on two weeks. Outcome of the event soreness around upper part of bicep, lymphadenopathy, and tendonitis was not recovered while the outcome of the sore deltoid was recovered in Dec2020. His second dose is scheduled tomorrow (14Jan2021) and wants to know if he can still take it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events myalgia and lymphadenopathy were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tendonitis with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I&#39;ve had both the first and second shot, with the second shot initial side effects occurring 10 minutes sooner and lasting  about 6 hours longer.  2nd wave effect occurred 3-4 days after shot;  it&#39;s only been 2 days since the  2nd shot, so that effect hasn&#39;t hit yet.   Note that  I had similar reactions to the flu vaccine&#39;s for 17 straight years , with the exception of the brain fog. Flu shot reactions stopped when I started taking Amway  Double X multivitamins and tripling up on Vitamin A, C, Zinc and echinacea 3 days before through after the vaccine.  Shot 1 - initial  side effects: 40 minutes after shot within a mile of returning to work from hospital, I suddenly got lightheaded and very tired with brain fog creeping in. Since that was closer than home, I continued  on to work hoping it would soon pass.  Brain fog,  dizziness and fatigue all  continued to worsen, and I was taken home. Effects lasted 9 hours. 3-4 days later the symptoms all came back and lasted 2-3  days, with the addition of temperatures in mid to high 96 range. My normal temperature is a degree low at 97.8.

                                                No initial symptoms other than sore arm at injection site which lasted for about 23 hours. On January 28 in the middle of the night woke up with pain in left hand. Could not move left hand. Was sleeping on back - not on arm or hand.  No restricted blood-flow.  Massaged hand and it became responsive.  This was followed by burning and tingling sensation in hand.  Hand was cold to touch first day. Burning and tingling and muscle tension increased for first couple days.  Would be intermittent and location varied. Hands and feet most common. Left back scapular area and left pectoral muscle common.  Muscle tightness would cause joint pain without signs of any redness. No temperature. No discoloration. Not as bad in middle of the day. After a few days. When second shot was administered on February 9 at 12:10 AM went home and all sensations stopped for about 12 hours. Took Tylenol with some benefit to diminish but not end symptoms. In past few days have read about taking antihistamines which has often helped.  Symptoms are not as intense as they started out to be, but they continue to linger.  Muscle tightness has largely given way to fluttering sensation or paresthesia and burning is mostly in bottom of left foot only. Any muscle tightness can be rubbed out (massage) for the most part. Occasional joint tightness continues in fingers - crack knuckles and it improves.

                                                Pt reported he got the second COVID vaccine at 8:33 am at the  Center at an event run by Health Clinic. At 10 am he began to feel unwell describing &#34;disorientation&#34; which upon further explanation seems he is describing difficulty with his proprioception, ie not able to tell where his body is in space, and disequilibrium, ie having to stop and hold on to something while walking. This lasted most of the day and subsided by evening. He has continued to have ongoing shorter episodes 3-4 times per day lasting 5-10 minutes. In addition he has noted increasing weakness in his right thigh, particularly when going from sitting to standing and the through swing while walking. He describes these as &#34;paralytic attacks&#34; that occur once or twice per day and last hours. Both symptoms are similar to those he had post CVA in 2019 and greatly improved with PT and home exercises. In addition he has noted fecal urgency and fecal incontinence in the last couple of weeks, he is unsure if this is directly related to the vaccine.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

                                                Right Foot started hurting the night after the vaccine. The next day, it hurt to  walk on it. Mainly around the base of my 2nd and 3rd toes. The next day it hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t walk on it and saw the doctor. A red area had developed on top of my foot at the base on my toes. Doctor though could be Gout but didn&#39;t really look like it and usually that is in the big toes. Plus the timing of this issue and my vaccine were suspect. Had X-ray on that Friday, two days after vaccine and everything looked fine they said. I was prescribed Celebrex  and over the weekend took two per day due to the pain. I stayed in bed all weekend and pain got worse before taking another dose of medicine which helped for a while.  Swelling continued to be about the same or a bit more and the redness moved over to my big toe and then up my foot around towards the right side. Today my right side of foot is really soar now as well and still can&#39;t walk on it and still swollen. Doctor at a urgent care sports medicine location prescribed me Prednisone steroid to see if that helps. But so far 5 days after vaccine and my foot is still swollen, red across the top and so painful it keeps me up at night and I can&#39;t walk on it. I&#39;m hoping the steroids work.

I was then felling like I had before the shot. Then about 4 days after receiving the vaccine the post acute syndrome symptoms again were much worse than before. This last for about 2 weeks then gradual worked back the my original feeling of fatigue, brain fog and tremors  that I had prior to vaccine

                                                I woke at 6:30am on 04/07/2021 in a state of complete confusion and disorientation.  It was a level of disorientation I have never experienced before in my lifetime.  I fainted one time and was having extreme difficulty getting my bearings and walking and was simply in total &#34;mental disarray&#34;.  I was having difficulty producing words, a prolonged stutter, you might say.  I was shaking.  The local paramedics came and I was taken to the local ER.  Because I was having difficulty speaking, the paramedics (and later the physicians) thought I might have had a TIA.  An MRI on 04/07/2021 at 5pm produced a negative result.  So i can only attribute my reaction to the vaccine.  It was very significant, and i thought it made sense to report it.

                                                passed out/unconscious; feel weak; dizzy; not normal; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 26Mar2021 09:45AM (Lot Number: ER8730) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no other medical history or known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not have COVID test post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. After taking the vaccine the patient waited for 15 minutes prior to departing the facility in order to make sure there was no adverse reactions. At approximately 10:15 10:30 AM the patient drove back home. After driving for about five minutes while stopped at a traffic light the patient completely passed out at 10:45, he was unconscious for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, almost crashed his car and EMT support had to be called. The patient regained his conscience but it took him over a half hour to feel 50% better. Until 8:30 PM 26Mar2021, the patient still felt weak and dizzy and not normal. No treatment was received for events. The outcome of events was recovering.

Got moderate (3 to 5 on 10-steps scale) pain in left upper arm/shoulder around 9 pm, limited mobility. Took 2 extra-strength Tylenols.    Between 2 and 3 am woke up because of severe headache (7 to 8), couldn&#39;t normally sleep because of that. Temperature 99.6 F. Another 2 Tylenols about 4 am. Not effective. Drinking a lot of water.    Decided to stay home. Contacted my supervisors by text and e-mail, left a voice message for EH.   8 am - another 2 Tylenols. Tried to sleep - slept till 1 pm. Headache improved (3-5), 99.3 F. Water and tea, minimal activity.    Received instructions from EH - to stay at home if any symptoms will take place, to get COVID test upon returning to the hospital.    Condition was improving during the day. Low pain and discomfort in the evening (2-3).    Sleeping normally during the night. No symptoms in the morning. No reason to delay returning to work.    Took COVID test at 9 am. Negative.    No symptoms since then&#34;

                                                I have had a weekly routine of fasting one day a week for the last 20 years. Sometimes I would extend this to 3 days, water only. I am healthy, 6&#39;1&#34; weight 170-180 all of my adult life. Resting HR &lt;56. 9 days after having my first vaccination, I did a 24 hour fast. I woke at 2 am to go to the bathroom. I became lightheaded and passed out while standing over the toilet. I layed on the floor for over 5 minutes with my head spinning. I then realized I was hypoglycemic. I have never had this issue. I took some orange juice and recovered my strength. I hit my head on the top of the toilet which required my to have 5 sutures in my chin at the ER that night.  Today I was working out for 30 minutes on an elliptical. I work out 4 to 5 times weekly.  10 minutes after returning to my room I noticed I was dizzy and checked my pulse from my watch. My HR was 210. this lasted for over 10 minutes. I have never had this issue.   I believe it would not be in my best interest to take the second vaccination.
