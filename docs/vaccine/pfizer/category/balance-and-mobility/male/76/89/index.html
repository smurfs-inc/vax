                                                Assessment: Individual stated he was feeling lightheaded approximately four minutes after receiving his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine via IM injection in his upper arm. Individual was seated at the time and was about to move from the vaccination station to the check out desk.  PT attempted to stand and said, ?Oh, I don?t feel so good?, after which vaccinator inquired with PT on what was wrong. After a brief assessment, notified personnel of the situation. Individual remained with the vaccinator, who obtained a set of vital signs and continued an assessment.  Vitals: (as I recollect, I gave the post it to the check out staffers who monitored the individual prior to his departure) BP: 126/54, P: 78, RR: 18, pale and sweating across his brow area. Denied chest pain, difficulty breathing, nausea, tingling, headache, stated only symptom was lightheaded ness which was dissipating. Provided the individual with bottled water to sip on, which he did. Individual?s last oral intake was at ~0845 PTA at the clinic, a normal breakfast of eggs, toast and coffee. Individual stated he had several cups of coffee but had not had anything else to drink that morning. Individual receives dialysis three days per week. He had an appointment Wednesday, next appointment is Friday. Individual did not have anyone driving him to the clinic, stated he would be fine and did not have anyone to come pick him up. He stated he was feeling better already.  After approximately 8 additional minutes, individual stated he thought he could get up and move to the check out station.  Individual was able to stand an ambulate to the check out line. Upon arrival at check out, transferred the individual to the check out personnel and Exit workers to monitor the individual?s condition for the remainder of the 30 minutes.

                                                Same evening of vaccine injection 3/24 - chills and severe headache and extreme fatigue.   Overnight - nausea, vomiting and fever 102.6.  Next morning 3/25, woke up and tried to get out of bed.  Legs were so weak they gave out and I fell out of bed on the floor.   I had no strength to get back up to get on the bed.  My wife could not lift me, so she called 911 for a &#34;lift assist&#34;.  Paramedics were told I received the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine the day before, so they picked me up off of the floor and put me back in bed.  They took my vitals - blood pressure was 116/73 and temperature was still 102.6.  Paramedics offered to take me to the hospital but I refused.  Paramedics told my wife that if my breathing became labored, she should get me to the ER or call 911 again.    I was not able to get out of bed the whole day on Thursday 3/25, because I was so weak I could not stand up, and I also had body aches and had to use a urinal because I could not walk to the bathroom.  My wife gave me Tylenol and the fever finally broke late evening of Thursday 3/25 and I started to feel a little bit better.  I had not eaten all day, but my wife made sure I stayed hydrated with water.  On Friday morning 3/26 I was able to sit up on the side of the bed, and I was able to walk with the assistance of a cane to the bathroom.  Extreme fatigue affected me all day Friday, but I did feel better.  Fever did not come back after it broke.  Saturday 3/27 - still experiencing extreme fatigue, but feel better overall.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 76-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 intramuscular on 25 Feb 2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at clinic. Medical history included hypertension, blood cholesterol increased, myocardial infarction, colon cancer (had surgery for that and also had chemotherapy), coronary artery disease (30% blocked coronary artery), covid-19 from 19May2020 to an unknown date. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril for hypertension; amlodipine; rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol increased; evolocumab (REPATHA), subcutaneously at 140 mg (twice a month) for blood cholesterol increased. The patient reported, he was diagnosed positive with COVID-19 on 27May2020 from which he seem to have recovered without any residues of symptoms or side effect. He received first Pfizer COVID vaccination at noon time this past Thursday 25Feb in a vaccination clinic set up, the following day Friday the 26 he woke up the next morning and entire body was so sore from head to toe and could hardly get himself out of bed, but when he got up, he was having difficulty walking, so anyway he stayed in bed all day on 26 and 27. He initially had a slight temperature, some chills, slight cough, runny nose and those symptoms except for the cough seem to have resolved, what hasn&#39;t resolved is about every 30 or 40 minutes or so he had been having to urinate ever since 26Feb2021 night, his mouth has been constantly very dry. Still urinating every half hour 45 minutes and ongoing. Mouth has been very dry and had a couple of areas where it seems like maybe he had bit his lip or something, maybe when he was sleeping. It was nothing like that in mouth anymore but the mouth is still constantly so dry like dehydrated and no matter how much of fluid he drank that doesn&#39;t seem to help it and what in fact has also caused was on yesterday morning he had been a little constipated on Friday night and then yesterday morning had a severe case of diarrhea. Now he had not had another bowel movement since yesterday morning as no appetite and feeling so lousy, and so tired and fatigued. He had been feeling even much worse since getting the vaccine. He still feels very fatigued, very sore all over, very tired, still have the slight cough and he would say that&#39;s about it. Outcome of events for cough, pain and tiredness was not recovered and for the rest of the events it was unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Dizziness and lightheadedness has persisted on and off for almost two months.  Felt much better for about 3 weeks and then it re-occurred and continues to this day (5/3/21).  On the evening of 4/29/21, actually passed out and hit the floor incurring head laceration.  Epley procedures have had no effect.  Doctors have not found cause.  Cardiologist has me starting on a monitor, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not the issue.  Dizziness comes and goes and is not always present.  Have never experienced these symptoms before.  No history of vestibular problems.  Very distressing.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after shot I suddenly had  dizzy feeling, my eyes became crossed, could not focus my eyes, everything was a blur.  I could think correct and carry on a conversation.  Took 2 Ibuprofen, drank 8oz of water and laid down for a half hour or so.  After about 40 minutes my eyes started coming back in focus.  My left eye was not seeing some cobweb stands but eventually stopped and became normal.  I then ate some food and everything seemed to be ok.  As I write this 5 hours after the above incident nothing more has happened.  My arm does not hurt either.  No other symptoms of any kind are occurring.

There was also minimal nausea and headache, intermittent. Slept well, but had a very difficult time walking from bed to toilet during early morning  due to the symptoms. Slightly improved by 7 AM in the morning. Intermittent episodes of the vertigo during Friday and Saturday, decreasing in intensity. Was able to exercise on stationary bike on Friday and Saturday PM. No symptoms Sunday AM (now). Will symptoms recur?

He went to the hospital with his wife on 3/1/2021.  He stated &#34;I think I&#39;m going to die&#34;.  Patient had been off Cymbalta  for 3 days completely- treating neuropathy (previous daily medication that his primary physician advised him with weaning down the dose).  The patient was manic and had tangential thoughts- from crying/angry to laughter.  It is believed that the agitation could be due to medication withdraw.

                                                severe dizziness on arising from bed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1686; expiration date: unknown) at 77-year-old vaccination age via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 31Jan2021 13:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to artificial crabmeat, NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), HBP (high blood pressure), GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease) and BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine but has other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced severe dizziness on arising from bed at 0800 hours. The dizziness subsided approximately 6 minutes later with no recurrence. The event did not require treatment. The event was considered non-serious. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the event was recovered on 04Feb2021 0806 hours.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

I could barely get out of bed (an awkward rollover did it).  My tongue was numb (still is) and raw from the presumed chewing on it.  Walking was slow and painful as all muscles hurt.  If I sneezed or coughed, my back would hurt.  Those last problems are still true. I periodically cough up phlegm and lacking a good place to spit it out, I just swallow it.  I have for the first time in my life been using a walker for stability. Right arm is almost useless due to pain.

A 77-years-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3246), via an intramuscular route of administration in the left arm on 28Jan2021 at 9:30 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included low iron from unspecified date to ongoing (diagnosed about two years ago). Concomitant medication included iron infusion taking for about 2 years, they cannot seem to straighten it out, states it is uncurable. He had too many red blood cells due to bone marrow, he got on iron infusions, and if his red blood cells gets to high, then they will perform phlebotomy to have them taken out. This was his second year receiving the infusions. He goes in once a week and they test him and sometimes he was able to get the infusion and sometimes he had to wait till the next week. Stated they took a pint of blood out of him about a week and a half ago. He goes every Thursday and his red blood cell count was 15.7. The weight of the patient was 205-206. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 28Jan2021, the patient had no problem with his arm, not really too many problems at all, except after he got home, the back of his left leg above the knee and back of his calf feels a little weird, tender. Stated he had a crazy feeling on the bottom of his heel, it was killing him, he can barely walk, he did not have this prior to getting the vaccine. He was worried about getting the second dose. Advised to contact hcp. Him and his wife have their second shot scheduled for 28Feb2021. He was told that it can be given up to 4 days ahead or anytime after. He read that Pfizer recommends 21 days between doses The feeling in his heel has stayed the same. States he slept ok. He does had a bad back. When he woke up and tried to put the weight on his left leg he can walk a couple of steps and his heel was killing him. Pain shooted up his leg. It was hard for him to walk. The back of his knee and calf are not really that bad, but he can feel it, he can barely walk. Caller asked have there been any reports of this and how long does it take for the pain to disappear. Caller stated the clinic where they received the vaccine told them the second dose can be scheduled 4 days before 21 days or a week or so after 21 days. Caller also asked if that was going to cause a problem if the second dose is scheduled 28 days after dose 1? they responded saying that &#34;The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination series was 2 doses given 3 weeks apart. This was how Pfizer-BioNTech studied the vaccine. Provided disclaimers that Pfizer was unable to speak outside of the EUA fact sheet and Pfizer was independent of a company guidelines and recommendations. He hoped the heel pain was going to go away and it was something from the vaccine, not something else. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

The vertigo goes away in a few minutes, but is uncontrolled while it lasts, and happens within a second or so after putting in the drops.

Uncommonly tired, no headache fever, chills, or neurodeficit otherwise.  ( I am a retired physician).  This lead to change in gait: slow, foot dragging, unstable.  Near accident in driving auto.  More than 4 time of urinary incontinence ie incontinence when bladder overfilled.  Mental clarity lost.  speech impaired by word searching.  Obvious change in behavior to those around me.

The patient was recovering from muscle spasms, stiffness, and joint stiffness. The outcome of the remaining events was not recovered.

A 78-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 (around 11:00 or 11:30 AM) on left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered at a military facility. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. He did not receive other vaccines 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient had his 1st dose on 12Jan2021. He was fine that day, but on the 13Jan2021, he woke up and was dizzy. He stated that he had no problem after having the shot, 15 minutes later, he had no problems; but, the next day he began having vertigo and dizziness. Vertigo and dizziness began 13Jan2021 at about 8:00 AM. This has continued the past 3 days. It is getting better, but he is wondering if that is a big problem. At the time of report, it&#39;s getting better but still have it. He asked if he should be concerned. It is quite a bit improved but it&#39;s still there. If he had to drive a car for an emergency, he thinks he could do it, but he wouldn&#39;t volunteer for that right now. He looked up all that stuff and it says that 20% of the people who take it have that. But when they list the side effects, they don&#39;t list dizziness until they list severe that is the only thing that has concerned him. He was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 09Feb2021, longer than the 3weeks. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Lightheadedness; Headache; tightness in his chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EK4176, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm/ shoulder area on 15Jan2021 at 11:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, patient has epilepsy that has been controlled since 1977; and issues with his blood pressure. He has no allergies. Concomitant medications included phenobarbital and phenytoin (DILANTIN), both for epilepsy. He takes HTZ TRI something, it is a long word but is basically 2 diuretic. He is also being followed by a cardiologist. Patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient got the COVID injection 2.5 hours ago on 15Jan2021 and after that he had a slight case of lightheadedness. He was instructed to drink water and walk if he was able, he did that and it helped. The patient relays that he was fasting that morning and thinks that had some degree of relatedness in the lightheaded feeling. He ate lunch and the light headedness resolved but now he has a slight headache. He was reading the paperwork and on the form under severe reactions, it mentions dizziness, weakness, and difficulty breathing. While he is breath ok, he has noticed a slight degree of tightness in his chest. He did not see this listed but wants to know if this is normal or if it would be related to the difficulty breathing. His main concern is if this is a severe reaction. He had lab work done prior to getting the vaccine, then none afterward. The events did not require visit to emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the event &#39;lightheadedness&#39; was recovered while unknown for the other events.

A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL9261 with Expiration Date 31May2021), via intramuscular, on 22Jan2021 (at 09:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing restless legs syndrome and ongoing acid reflux. Relevant concomitant medications included omeprazole ongoing from an unknown date for acid reflux and gabapentin ongoing from an unknown date for restless legs syndrome. Her husband had the injection on Friday 22Jan2021. The next morning his left foot was swollen up really bad, red and tender and he could not walk on it. He has had problems like that before and he had it checked and was told it is not gout. It did not go away and she called the nurse on Sunday morning, and the nurse did not think it was a reaction and told her that a lot of times it is swelling in the lymph nodes. He was advised to go and see a podiatrist on Monday. He saw the podiatrist yesterday morning and the podiatrist gave him a one injection that contained Lidocaine, dexamethasone, and depomederol. After injection, the swelling right down and his foot was ok. The patient went to go get the Moderna injection and she asked those giving the injection if it was ok for her husband to get that injection from the podiatrist. She was told that people are not supposed to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) or ibuprofen. She was told that they did not think it was a good idea for her husband to get that injection from the podiatrist and it may have wiped out the benefit of the Pfizer COVID VACCINE. His foot was 95% recovered, he could walk on it and the swelling was down. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                Patient received his first dose of vaccine on 2/10 at 11:30am. (His 2nd is scheduled for 3/3) He started with sx ~13 hrs later - He started drifting out of consciousness, then had labored breathing through night rendering him unable to sleep. After getting up in the morning, his breathing was better but he felt lightheaded/weak through the day. By the next morning (Friday 2/12), he was so bad next morning that wife called 911 - He reports that he was there and then not there and was losing track of train of thought. He was taken to ER via EMS, where his HR was initially 15 - He was admitted to hospital - initially a temporary pacer was placed, then a permanent one on Monday, 2/22. He has had other episodes like this in past 13 mos. PCP referred him to neurologist and EENT. Neurology work-up, including MRI and 72 hr EEG were unremarkable, although he learned retrospectively that there was a time during EEG where HR was only 35. EENT found no auditory or other issues . *MD in ER told him that if issues were not neuro in nature, they were probably cardiac.

A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EN5318; dose 1) intramuscularly on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 78-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 25Jan2021 during the 15 minute waiting period after the vaccine, the patient experienced dizziness. He denied difficulty breathing and swallowing. A differential diagnosis of systemic reaction (hypoglycemia, hypotension, generalized rash) was provided. The patient was given unspecified treatment and follow-up response was good. The patient denied dizziness when standing up and walking to leave the medical evaluation bay and clinical outcome of dizziness was completely resolved prior to discharge.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Went to bed and by mid afternoon shivers were gone as well as sweating. Slept all day and into the evening, by 10pm or so all seemed back to normal. Mid afternoon I sat up on the edge of the bed to go to the bathroom and passed out falling on my left knee (bad one) and hit my forehead on the bathroom door scraping and bruising same above left eye brow. Walking with pain in left knee but getting better daily.

Walking was unsteady and organizing thoughts was difficult.  This was my primary symptom with the infection which lasted through 02/16/2021.  The last three days were spent in the Covid-19 unit of a local hospital after which the symptoms disappeared.  The day after the vaccination, the symptoms came back but only lasted for about 24 hours.

                                                Progressive lower extremity weakness with markedly diminished reflex: Per the history it appears that patient has had a progressive course of this problem over the last 1 week.  His symptomatology is mostly consistent with gait ataxia with some lower extremity weakness.  He mentions that his weakness of the lower extremities became more and more pronounced towards the end of the week when he would start trembling in his legs whenever standing for some time.  Although he had some numbness and tingling few days ago but that does not seem to be the predominant symptoms.  There was no preceding symptoms of any viremia prior to this.  Although he has Covid in January, however he did not have cough expectorations upper respiratory infection or any diarrhea in the last 1 month.  He has not been exposed to any new pets or any new medications.  His clinical exam suggest a lower extremity weakness more proximal than distal although there appears to be some sensory sparing.  He has diminished reflexes all over including absent reflexes in his lower extremities and many of the upper extremities.  His imaging study did not show any specific etiology for the cause of his problem.  He does not have any spinal etiology and his exam does not show any upper motor type of involvement.  His spinal fluid shows a high protein with no cells consistent with cytoalbuminogenic dissociation.  So he definitely fits with the diagnosis of acute immune mediated demyelinating polyneuropathy or Guillain-Barré syndrome.  On IVIG therapy.  Overall appears to be some improved however not still able to walk.

I was unable to lift arm to shoulder without discomfort. I took more Advil. I had a 101.5 fever. I actually felt worse than I did when I had COVID back on 12-10-20. I spent the next 4 hours in bed. I got up at 11:00 am and went to the couch to lie down for most of the day. I started feeling slightly better around 5:00 pm. I had dinner and laid around. I went to bed at 10:00 pm. Everything lasted a period of 23 hours. I&#39;m feeling back normal today.

                                                A little over a week ago I was admitted to a local hospital having been diagnosed with Guillain?Barré syndrome, a debilitating condition where the body?s auto immune system attacks the nervous system resulting in peripheral numbness in one?s hands, feet and legs. This condition was diagnosed by a neurologist. Following his diagnosis, I spent 8 days in the Hospital and was treated for 5 days with a daily dose of 400ml of immune globulin (IVIG) to rebuild the damage to my nervous system.   On April 10, I began to feel the onset of Guillain Barré syndrome as the bottoms of my feet suddenly began to tingle and feel numb. The next day I tripped while returning our waste management garbage cans to our garage.  Fell face forward onto the driveway and was bruised pretty bad.  The next day my BP zoomed to 224/160.  911 was called and I was taken to our local hospital fearing and thinking that I was having a heart attack.  I spent 4 days in the hospital being checked for a possible heart attack and all the while my Guillain Barré syndrome was progressing undiagnosed.  I was discharged and instructed to see a neurologist for the tingling and numbness in my hands, legs and feet.  Within 15 minutes of the neurologist consult,  a few days following my discharge, I was told I had Guillain Barré syndrome and get to a hospital. I left his office and went straight to the emergency room and I spent the next 8 days there and was discharged Tuesday, 4 May 2021. Several hospital neurologists treating me  believed the vaccination triggered the syndrome as do I.  It&#39;s not being widely reported even though there have been several Facebook postings of people saying the same thing as me.

                                                On March 2, he woke up feeling bad and had a fever of 102.7. He took tylenol and liquids all day and the fever came down to around 100. The next morning he woke up complaining of excruciating pain in his left arm (site of the injection). He couldn&#39;t stand to have anything touch it, couldn&#39;t move it and couldn&#39;t sleep because of the pain. The next morning he woke up very weak, wasn&#39;t able to speak clearly, wasn&#39;t making sense. He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn&#39;t do it at that hospital.  He was transferred to another hospital.  The doctors at that hospital determined the pacemaker was not the source.  It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.  He lived another 2 weeks but never was able to recover. Until the day he was put on paliative care, he expressed pain in the arm where he had received the vaccination. He died at 5:30 a.m. on April 1, 2021.

No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No history of previous immunizations with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, this was the first dose. No additional vaccine administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 13Jan2021, the patient received the vaccine. He clarified the reaction as, on Saturday 23Jan2021 all of a sudden it was quick he got real light headed, dizzy, he felt like his equilibrium was way off. He felt like he had a mild case of vertigo. He was wobbly, he ached, and felt terrible. It was a yucky feeling. He also felt nauseous, and it went away soon as he ate. He had never had a feeling like that before. He stayed down all day. He noticed all these events that occurred on Saturday 23Jan2021 started late morning around 10-11 in the morning. By the afternoon he was on his back for the rest of the day. It knocked him for a loop. Sunday 24Jan2021 he woke up and felt a little better. He still had some of the symptoms, but they were milder and kept getting milder through out the day. By Sunday afternoon they were almost gone and by Monday 25Jan2021 he felt normal and great. Tuesday 26Jan2021 these same feelings hit him again, but not the same way and was not as bad. Then 27Jan2021, they were gone and he felt fine. He went to the doctor&#39;s office yesterday (27Jan2021). The doctor thought he was having an inner ear problem. He has a history of tinnitus and the doctor thought this was causing the light vertigo symptoms. He was light headed, wobbly. He was prescribed Meclizine-25mg one tablet by mouth three time a day. Now, today, 28Jan2021, he woke up this morning and he had the same feelings again. He was wobbly. He had the same feelings that he experienced on Saturday 23Jan2021. However, they were milder. He felt like it is a little vertigo. He did not feel stable. He had never had anything like this happen before. The patient stated he is pretty healthy for his age. he is very active. He usually plays golf, but has not recently. The patient believes he is having a reaction from vaccine, he is not sure, but he is having some of the symptoms. The doctor provided him with medication, but he has not started it yet. He does not know if he should. Caller is thinking these events are related to the shot. He is due to get his second shot on 03Feb2021. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

No breathing problem but did feel fatigued.  After coughing up in morning, no other phlegm all day.  Then, for a week, I had trouble with balancing,  like walking after too many drinks.  That has essentially resolved itself.  OK now.  Really don&#39;t know if adverse reaction or possibly a &#39;bug&#39;.  Thought it best to let you know.

                                                After duing light work on Saturday morning. I sat down for a few minutes and felt a little light headed.  My stomach became quisy and I had to go into the bathroom, became nauseated and had to vomit. I had a quisy stomach most of the balance of the day.  I experiecnced a restless night. However, by mid-morning  Sunday I began to feel better and have had no additonal inegative effect.  The only other  unexplained  item was that on Sunday I checked my blood presure and it was 154/ 85. This is very unusual,  as due to the nifedipine I take for my DES, my average for years is around 125/80.  Today, Tuesday, I checked it again and it still  at 158/87.  I have an appointment with my cardiologist  in 2 weeks and will discuss this with him.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as BNT162B2 or even four weeks prior and had no problems with vaccines in the past. The patient experienced fever, chills, extreme weakness; so weak he couldn&#39;t stand up out of a chair, and felt really bad on 26Jan2021. He had a fever a little over 100 degrees, extreme weakness. He was so week he couldn&#39;t stand up out of a chair. He also had chills and just felt really bad. The patient thinks he was over it, he hoped. The events did not require any visit to the Emergency Room or Physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events was recovering.

When I open my right hand my ring finger would hang up and not extend with the others.  It would lock up half way open  and then extend the rest of the way.  The condition has not changed since.  I had my second shot on 02/10/2021 at 2pm.  I didn&#39;t see a doctor about it since it is not critical except for a little lose of dexterity.

He notes that he received a 2nd 5 0 COVID-19 vaccination on March 6th and since then has not felt well, feeling short of breath and generally fatigued.  He notes that he has not been very active since receiving the vaccine.   CT PE study showed an increased RV to LV ratio 1.2.  He had no elevation in his troponin or BNP.  His echocardiogram showed an EF of 60% and there were no wall motion abnormalities and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient would prefer Eliquis at this time.  He will need a 6 month course of Eliquis.  Given the setting of recent COVID vaccination and recent decreased mobility as possible provoking factors, this will be treated as a provoked pulmonary embolus.  Per hospital COVID vaccine protocol, patient presentation will be reported to pharmacy for FDA reporting.

A 79-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number: EL8982 and Expiration date not reported), via intramuscular route of administration in the left arm on 28Jan2021 07:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient was not allergic to anything. It was reported that patient was generally in good health in 79. He knows there may be some adverse effects. Last Thursday (on 28Jan2021) he got his first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine and he&#39;s been having muscle pains. The only thing that has happened to him was a lot of muscle pain, quite a bit. Through the day he started to feel the muscle pain and through the night he felt some stuff (referring to the muscle pain), very lightly enough to be a nuisance. States from the waste up he felt drowsiness. The first night he slept some but not much since he could not get in a position where he could sleep very much. The next morning the muscle pain was much more severe, more pronounced on his left-side, which is the side he had the shot, particularly in several areas like right underneath his armpit and between his arm and elbow. By the end of 2nd day, the pain had spread to the right hand and the day after that, it was concentrated on the left arm on the injection site. The next morning the muscle pain went over to the other shoulder and basically spread out all over his upper body. It has since worsened by then. He broke down last night and he took two Advil, and he got a really good night sleep. This morning he got up and the muscle pain gradually came back but not quite a s bad, states maybe the Advil was slowly wearing off. States it was a funny sensation, a lot of them. Patient feels it on the bottom of the side of his rib cage and neck. He was asking how long the muscle pain will go on. He hates to combine anything he will experience from the second dose with what he was currently experiencing. Patients understanding was that the second dose will worse. Patient ask can he take the 2nd dose on his opposite arm (right), he do not want to feel pain on the same side again. He has a card that states when he was supposed to get his second dose. States it hurts, it hurts to turn his head and he cannot drive safely. States his wife got her vaccine two days before him. He puts his glasses on to read the con-tact details from his hcp card. When querying outcome of drowsiness, he reports it occurred a few times off and on and it comes and goes, it does not stay around. Prior to vaccination patient did not take any other vaccines within 4 weeks. The patient experienced he&#39;s been having muscle pains, he felt drowsiness, it hurts to turn his head and he cannot drive safely, muscle pain went over to the other shoulder and basically spread out all over his upper body. The outcome of event was not recovered for myalgia, condition aggravated and unknown for somnolence, impaired driving ability.  Follow-up activities have been completed and no further information is expected.

                                                About 2 weeks following 2nd vaccination I began to experience dizziness when first laying in bed, getting out of bed or chair. I have never had this before and am otherwise quite healthy. I have tried Epley maneuver for Vertigo.  I still have the problem. Blood pressure was normal. I contacted my PCP after 2 weeks and he referred me to an ENT specialist. Internet sources say this happens to 18% of Covid vaccine recipients. So I question if the ENT Dr would be of any help, and can this go away soon on its own.

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, dose 2, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostate cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and major radial prostatectomy from 04Feb2021 to an unknown date. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced chills, low grade fever and fatigue. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of BNT162B2. The patient was fine, had no problems until 15Mar20201 (4 days afterwards), the patient stated, &#34;I started getting chills, shaking uncontrollably , nausea, fatigue, a little bit of everything. I wouldn&#39;t be calling you but this has not subsided. It&#39;s been 3 weeks now and I&#39;m not feeling well. It ebbs and tides. I&#39;ve been taking a diary. I went to the ER last Monday because I was wheezing in the morning and had shortness of breathe in between all the other symptoms. They did all kind of blood tests, covid test which was negative, chest x-ray showed bronchitis. Blood work and ultrasound of my bladder with unknown results. They sent me home with a inhaler, steroid and an antibiotic and every day since then it seems like at night 9, or 10 o&#39;clock I start feeling better and sleep through the night. My fever is 97.7 degrees fahrenheit but about 2, 3 or 4 o&#39;clock my fever ticks up a little and I start to feel lousy, my stomach feels. I feel like I have hot flashes; a feeling of warmth with achiness and lack of appetite. So I take my Tylenol 7 or 8 o&#39;clock at night my temperature is 97.7F. I haven&#39;t had 1 good day since. I&#39;ve been to my doctor, ER, I&#39;ve talked with the CDC. What information do you have for people who have had long term symptoms/side effects? What am I supposed to do? Someone from Pfizer needs to give me advice. If not I&#39;ll go to  the news network. I don&#39;t feel well. It&#39;s directly related. No one has given me relief or help. It&#39;s impacting my life. I&#39;ve been sick every day.  Is there someone above you who can tell me what to do? I took their (Pfizer&#39;s) vaccine that was recommended. It was your vaccine. Not mine. Someone has to have an answer for me. Unless you want to go and have lawsuit and the news. Just think about it, if you had to go through the symptoms of having the flu everyday. Please relay this to someone. If I don&#39;t heard back within a week, then I&#39;m going ballistic. It&#39;s not going to be pretty. Someone has to get back to me to help. I want someone to tell me that I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m not the only experiencing this. There has to be an answer. I took your vaccine. You are responsible. I want to know. I can&#39;t be the only one in the whole world who is feeling like this. I&#39;ve been to the ER and the doctors. I&#39;ve had every side effects but theirs go away in a few days, but mine hasn&#39;t. I need advice, that I&#39;m not nuts, something that will help me get better. I want to feel better. It&#39;s effecting my family my life. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd? I can&#39;t be the only one? Someone has to know something. They (drug companies) like to hide the facts. I am sick because I took BNT162B2 vaccine. I need someone to get back to me.&#34; After the second dose of BNT162B2, the patient has been experiencing an achy feeling, heat throughout the body, shivering, shaking, trouble walking, and some fever. He reports taking Tylenol, and that helps, but he is still having symptoms that come and go and it has been 3 weeks since the second injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. He reports going to the ER for treatment after the second injection, and a COVID-19 test was negative and they did not find anything else other than the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine that would be causing his symptoms.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients (father and mother). This is the first (father) of the two reports.  A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Dose 1) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 26Mar2021 (batch/lot number: ER8727) at 79 years old as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing AFib (atrial fibrillation) diagnosed between 1 and 2 years ago. Patient also has a pacemaker from an unknown date. Patient was exposed to COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) oral from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 5 mg twice a day taken for AFib (atrial fibrillation). On 07Apr2021, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to a fall; he fell in the bathroom and passed out. The patient is on Eliquis, so they were worried about bleeding. He tested positive for COVID on 07Apr2021, this was the same day he was admitted to the hospital. He was discharged on 10Apr2021 and was improving. It was reported that the reporter (patient&#39;s son) tested positive for COVID on 27Mar2021, so it was likely his parents were exposed or infected prior to their first dose of the vaccine. The reporter confirmed he has not been vaccinated. The patient was due to get the second shot today, but the reporter cancelled the appointment since his dad was still in quarantine. The reporter heard different things about when to get the second dose, everyone says to wait 90 days, they&#39;re getting mixed information, then he has heard 3 weeks is long enough to wait. The reporter wanted to know when his dad can get the second dose of the vaccine after having the COVID-19 infection. The patient is recovering from &#34;he fell in the bathroom and passed out.&#34; Outcome of the event &#34;tested positive for Covid&#34; was unknown.   This case involves a Product Complaint: Consumer reported that his father and mother tested positive for Covid infection on 07Apr2021 after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 26Mar2021. It was not provided if a sample of the product was available to be returned, if requested and if packaging was sealed and intact.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021443810 same reporter, same drug, same event, different patient

This 80-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: UNKNOWN) via unspecified route in Apr2021 (at the age of 79-years-old) as a single dose for the corona virus, to get rid of it/ it&#39;s supposed to be sure he didn&#39;t get it. Patient had no medical history. There was no relevant family medical history. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the COVID-vaccine. Patient had no adverse events following prior vaccinations. He remembers his first polio shot he got that back in the early 50&#39;s and his second shot was a cube of sugar, called the salt vaccine. Stated he&#39;s been getting vaccines for a long time and he never had any trouble with any of them. The patient previously received the initial dose of the BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) in 2021 (March or April) in the left arm which was deemed invalid by the vaccination provider due to temperature related issues (i.e wasn&#39;t cold enough). He explained he received a letter informing him of this incident and recommending a replacement dose (which he thinks was on 06Apr2021). About 2 to 3 weeks before he got his first COVID shot, he got a flu shot in his left arm, about 4 or 5 inches above where he got his COVID shot. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not specified. He reported that the second vaccine (BNT162b2) caused him problems. On 06May2021, he woke up with his right wrist twice as thick as his left one, it was swollen real bad. The right wrist was quite sore and painful. He didn&#39;t know if he was getting carpal tunnel or what it was, so he went to the ER about it and they gave him three different kinds of pills, two of which included tramadol 50mg one every day and ibuprofen 400 mg. The ER couldn&#39;t determine the cause for his reaction. About 3-4 days after taking the prescribed medication, his reaction subsided quite a bit and was not nearly as hurtful, but his left wrist then started swelling and being painful/sore. Therefore, he continued to take his medication and it improved. It was like that for a couple/ three days, and it calmed down. He thought he was okay 2-3 days ago, but this morning (14May2021), his right shoulder was swollen and pretty sore and was getting worse; he was in so much pain, so sore he could hardly even move his arm, he couldn&#39;t pick it up straight in the air, couldn&#39;t get his elbow up past his ear. The patient also reported that when he got off his bed, his left knee was sore and it felt like a fire underneath his kneecap and he was having trouble walking. The left knee was swollen real bad and was hotter than a firecracker. Thus, he went back to taking his pill again. The knee pain started the morning  of 14May2021 about the same time it seemed and has worsened, and he took a 400mg ibuprofen and the other pill he&#39;s taking, &#34;100 mg doxycycline or something&#34;. Patient hadn&#39;t been doing much since, he was feeling kind of laid up, he had thought it was all done with yesterday (13May2021). He stated he&#39;s been hearing things about allergic reactions to this COVID shot, was sure that a lot of people are having complaints of allergic reactions, and was sure he&#39;s not the only one who has had a problem like this. He asked if there was anything he can take to block it because he is sure when this calms down after a week or whatever, it will be his in his right knee or left shoulder or wrists or ankles and he&#39;s 100% it&#39;s about that COVID shot. He stated he&#39;s never had arthritis before. He stated that he has never had any problems like this before. He is supposed to go see his doctor in a week or two. He tried to call the doctor to make an appointment, but he figured he would wait a couple days, but he is hurting bad today (14May2021), and he hasn&#39;t been to anybody yet except for the ER. The patient stated it looks like the vaccine is methodically causing this spread into his body. He also reported that it feels warm outside of his left wrist, towards the edge of it and all the way to the joint of the little finger and he thinks the swelling will start again. He expressed feeling anxious about his reactions. He asked if there were any kinds of pills he could take to block the effects of the vaccine from working in his body. He stated it seems like it&#39;s going from one area to the next and it seems like it&#39;s going through his joints and he doesn&#39;t like that. His left wrist still got a little bit of soreness in the back near the joint, but doesn&#39;t appear to be swollen. Regarding the right wrist, he has recovered completely, it feels better; doesn&#39;t feel any soreness in any place and doesn&#39;t look swollen. The clinical outcome of right wrist twice as thick/left wrist started swelling recovered on unspecified date; left wrist painful/sore not recovered; right shoulder is so sore not recovered; left knee was sore not recovered; anxious was unknown; feels &#34;warm&#34; outside of his left wrist/ felt like a fire underneath his kneecap was unknown; left knee is swollen not recovered; arm was so sore unknown; carpal tunnel unknown; trouble walking unknown; right shoulder was swollen was not recovered.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2 , was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021551521 same patient/reporter/drug with different AE/time gap.

                                                Two weeks after the first Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, the patient experienced vertigo-like symptoms with severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. He was admitted to the hospital where he stayed for a few days. After treating for vertigo, symptoms subsided. These symptoms have recurred several times since then. He was hospitalized again last week for several days. He also made another trip to the ER. Other times he was treated at home with prescribed medicine. He had symptoms of encephalitis. After multiple tests proved inconclusive, we now suspect this was an adverse event brought about by the first Covid-9 vaccine.

He started  to have mild muscle pain just before the 2nd vaccine and continued. Few days after the 2nd vaccine, his muscle pain got worse. He went to a pain clinic from 4/5/21 to 4/9/21. He stopped going there because his muscle pain got worse and he could not walk or move. On 4/16, he made an appointment to see Dr. (orthopedic) and Dr. could not see anything wrong with the X-ray. Dr. said he had a similar case with other patients and pain shots will not fix it. Pt saw PCP (his main doctor) on 6/7/21 and told him he still has muscle pain with muscle spasm and he cannot move or walk. PCP told him to  exercise. Pt is still in serious muscle pain and he is homebound from 4/9/21 to now.  He cannot walk or move. His symptoms have not improved at all. We do not know what to do because his muscle pain won?t go away for about 4 months now.

A 79-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for Injection, Lot Number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 16Feb2021 09:00 (at the age of 79-year-old) at a 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included foot tumor. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior vaccinations. The patient previously took historical vaccine of first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for Injection, Lot Number: EL9265) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 29Jan2021 09:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

AE resulted to visit physician office. Patient is a consumer, asking what do I do or what can I take to make this pain go away. Patient reported that he received both doses of the Pfizer covid vaccine, his first dose in January and his second dose February 1. Patient reported that around the same time that he got his shots his foot started hurting and now I can&#39;t walk. Patient reported that he has a soft tumor on both feet but his right foot is having pain, the tumor is sticking out and the pain is starting to get worse. Patient reported that nothing works to take the pain away. Patient reported that he saw his doctor a while back but reports that back then the pain wasn&#39;t as bad, they did x-rays and nothing was wrong. Patient reported that now the pain is terrible. Soon after having the COVID vaccine shot in Jan 2021, patient started having foot problems on his right foot. Patient did have a preexisting soft tumor in that foot. It is irritated where he cannot wear a shoe now. Patient can&#39;t stand or walk on it. It is constantly aching. A couple of days ago, a shooting pain started up into his knee and it just aches all the time. Patient was wondering if this is one of the side effects. Patient wants to find out if it is caused by the vaccine. Patient had a x-ray three weeks ago, and there was nothing wrong with his foot. Patient had no break, no spurs, or anything. Everything was normal except for that same mass in his foot. Patient thinks the vaccine affected the mass. Patient can&#39;t walk on his foot it just aches. Patient foot became irritated in Jan 2021. It was irritating. It has worsened. The shooting pain up to his knee started 26 Apr 2021. Patient just drove to the hospital today to get information and the pain shot up a little bit today. Even when patient is sitting in a chair he has aching and shooting pains in his foot. Patient went to the store in pain. Patient cannot do anything, cannot get up and out of chair, can&#39;t turn around with his foot on the floor. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included x-ray was normal -he had a x-ray three weeks ago, and there was nothing wrong with his foot. He had no break, no spurs, or anything. Everything was normal except for that same mass in his foot. Outcome of the event a shooting pain started up into his knee and it just aches all the time was not recovered, and rest of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

An 80-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNtech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL1283) , via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 01:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included open heart surgery 11 years ago, covid-19 from Jul2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received bnt162b2 yesterday, with no problems. However today (18Jan2021), in 15 minutes after waking up at 11, he had the chills really bad, that went away, then he went to sleep again and woke up and he had all the symptoms on the paperwork, he had dizziness, headache, he&#39;s hardly ever had a headache ever. He had aches and pain. Caller states that he was just asking right now about another company, and their vaccine in started with an M, and her daughter is at a girls home, because she has a epileptic type thing, and this particular shot, that started with M, the nurse called over, and the problems that he is having he explained to the nurse is like when he had the virus previously about in Jul2020, when he had the virus he was in hospital for a week, because he had to get rid of the virus, and they got him out of that. Now he took this shot yesterday and the next day is when he got all these symptoms, he&#39;s tired, cant walk, muscle pain, had chills not any more, pain in the knees, everywhere really, he couldn&#39;t get any position to go back to sleep, his back knees elbow joint pain. Since he had these things, the nurse at the girls home, told his wife if having these problems he can take 300 mg of Zinc, 1000mg of Vitamin C, and 2000IU or Vitamin D, the same thing, that amount, he asks will it over come the symptoms. Another person felt good after getting those, it helped him he does state however that is what the person took when he actually had the Covid 19 Virus. Caller states that he received paperwork after the vaccine from the (State), it has a bunch of blocks asking if he has this or that symptom. His First dose was 17Jan2021 at 1:15, then on 07Feb2021 if this Second Dose. All the side effects started Today 18Jan2021. His doctor said he&#39;s in good health. He did have open heart surgery 11 years ago. The patient reported he is 5 feet 8 and a half inches, he is shrinking. He stated, &#34;I was good until this morning, it hit me like I had the virus. The product they gave me at the (State) was the Pfizer-biontech vaccine. I had all the symptoms except vomiting/throwing up. I got all the other symptoms. no matter which way I turned it was hurting, knees, everything was hurting really bad. I was dizzy and weak so I don&#39;t want to walk around too much. I had muscle pain, joint pain, fever, headaches, chills, never went away. I hurt everywhere. I am really weak. My eyes are hurting. My daughter is in a girls home (paralysis problem). They had the vaccine from the another company and they have heard so many negative stuff so they decided they did not want to, when my wife told her I was having these problems. I had the virus 4 months, the nurse told me to take 300mg of zinc, 1000mg vitamin C and 2000mg vitamin D (the person took that when he had the disease). Should I take this stuff? Is there any information on that? what&#39;s in this? protein? my wife got the disease. They said she had enough antibodies. How long is the immunity? When does it start?&#34; The outcome of the event chills was resolved, of other events was unknown.

This happened  again at 5 a.m.and 7 a.m. when he awakened to urinate. He called his doctor that morning who advised him to go to the ER to rule out a stroke. He was admitted overnight for observation. A CT scan of the head was negative for stroke. He had a follow up MRI head which was also negative for stroke. He will follow up with his neurologist.

The next day I developed aches in lower extremities.  The third day, I went to the emergency room and was given a muscle relaxer. This has not relieved the pain.  The pain has now moved into my ankle joints and it is very painful to walk.  I visited my doctor on the seventh day and was given a pain killer, Meloxicam (15mg), and this is relieving some of the pain when I walk.

                                                My Husband and I received the same day a strong pain in our left arms. The next day my husband complained about pain in his entire body and weakness, and I had the same.  In the evening he collapsed falling out of his wheelchair.  He tried for an hour to sit down back in his wheelchair with my help, but he couldn&#39;t.   He agreed that I call 911.  Two nurses took him to Emergency Room at Hospital and didn&#39;t allow me to go with him.  In the morning on Saturday, he was transferred to Room at Hospital and the next day to the Intensive Care Room, where he sadly passed away on Tuesday April 13 at 4:22 am.

He then was having difficulty walking for a couple of weeks. The leg pain was not constant, but he did fatigue easily with walking.  On 3/11 he had his lower dentures placed and that evening/early morning of 3/12 he apparently fell. Patient does not remember anything about the fall - he cannot recall when he fell, how he fell, or any of his symptoms leading up to the fall.  Patient remembers being on the floor and attempting to get up but was too weak. He has rug burns on his forearms from attempting to get up.  He was hospitalized on 3/13 for dehydration, traumatic rhabdomyolysis, and w/u following fall.  Despite very stable labs prior to 1st dose of vaccination on 2/5/21, following vaccination he has had significant and substained leukocytosis as well as transfusion dependent anemia that has not resolved at the time of the reporting (5/13/21).  He remains at a skilled nursing facility due to debility.

An 80-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17May2021 09:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8729) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included heart valve replacement from 12Mar2021, kidney infection, had a heart bypass and is diabetic. The patient has no concomitant medications. The patient got the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 17May2021, and the next day (18May2021) he woke up with dizziness. The reporter asked how long the symptoms last after the Covid vaccine. He is sort of getting nausea when he tries to get up. He was also real depressed. It kind of started the next day after the vaccine (18May2021), but Wednesday she was concerned because the patient was crying a lot which is unusual for him. The nausea started today (25May2021). He hasn&#39;t been up and about. The dizziness is about the same. They called his primary caregiver who started him on some antidepressants. She picked up the information sheet that was given to them with the Covid vaccine and read there that dizziness was a side effect and a feeling of impending doom which is sort of how he was feeling. Now that&#39;s why she was wondering when the symptoms would be over. She doesn&#39;t really think he needs anything. He has never been depressed. She thinks now it is a side effect from the vaccine. She thinks the depression has improved. He is not crying anymore, but somebody is with him all the time. This was his first dose of the vaccine. He is supposed to go back on 07Jun2021 for his second. The outcome the event depression was recovering, event crying was recovered on an unspecified date and the other events was not recovered.

An 81-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246, expiry: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 11:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included retired, he became allergic to penicillin when he was 17 year old and hasn&#39;t taken it since, lost his taste and smell, potassium is high sometimes - the doctor recommend he cut down on banana and potatoes, extra heart beat, stomach acid, and thyroid disorder. Ongoing concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium - has been taking it for a year and a half to two years for thyroid, metoprolol succinate - has been on it about a year and half because an EKG showed he had an extra heart beat, and omeprazole capsule - been on it two or three years for stomach acid. The patient previously took trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy. After having a Pfizer shot on Saturday, he had a reaction - dizziness. His wife also received the COVID vaccine but did not have any reaction. He sat in the office for 15 minutes like he was supposed to. He drove home and was fine. Two hours later he was so dizzy he couldn&#39;t stand up. He was holding onto things to walk through the house. That was two hours after he took the vaccine. After that he thought it would go away in a day. All day yesterday, which was the second day, he was still dizzy. If he laid down the bed would float. It was an awful experience. He received the vaccine at 11:45am on 09Jan2021. Two hours later is when it started. He had to hold onto the rail to get up there. If he gets up quick it is still there. He just had blood work and was due back in Apr for check up. He hasn&#39;t had taste and smell for four years or better. He lost his taste and smell and never got it back. He doesn&#39;t know what caused that. He hasn&#39;t been sick. Outcome of the event dizziness was recovering, for the other events was unknown.

                                                Patient is a 81 y.o. gentleman with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma, urinary retention for which he self catheterizes twice daily, as well as recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation that presents complaining of increasing weakness and falls.  Patient fell 2/18 pm trying to get out of bed and he took about 20 minutes to get himself to a position where he could pull himself back up.  Again 2/19 he was trying to get up and his legs were too weak to carry him and he fell to the ground.  He needed assistance to get up and family asked him to come to emergency room for evaluation.  He has been feeling poorly for about a month, with poor appetite and has lost about 15 pounds.  He is not nauseated or short of breath and has no cough.  He was apparently treated for UTI about 4 to 6 weeks ago after a visit to urgent care.  He has since been to a different urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was referred to a cardiologist who is planning to do a stress test in a few weeks.  I believe he is on Eliquis now.  In ER he was found to have significant pyuria and bacteriuria and was given a dose of Rocephin.  Renal function shows worsening from levels in December although it is pretty stable over the past month from looking through other labs.

                                                My RA began to really act up.  My whole body stiffened up-(legs, hands, hips, back).  Lower back made it hart to bend over, Rt shoulder had a swelling and hurt at a pinch point in shoulder, my rt hip hurt when I walked more than 0.25 miles, my hands swelled and could not use hand well. Did not initially link to Covid shot, so called my Rheumatologist on the sixth day that the symptoms continued.  Received prescription to reduce muscle  tension and an anti inflamatory.  However, a couple of days after talking to my doctor and before taking any of the prescribed meds, the symptoms went away and since that time, my RA is back to typical old symptoms and pain level.

                                                Patient developed a syncopal episode one day following the vaccine.  Without warning, he fell to the ground, losing control of bowel and bladder, although no seizure activity noted at the time.  He transiently lost consciousness and then woke up confused and combative.  Brought to emergency room and admitted with multiple rib fractures.  Initial brain imaging was negative but 24 hours later, noted to have small hemorrhagic brain contusion in left frontal/temporal region and a small subdural hematoma.  One day later, there was not noted to be any extension of the hemorrhage/hematoma.

                                                Patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine at on Monday, February 15. That evening, he experienced visual disturbances with slightly blurred vision. Not thinking anything of it at the time, the vision cleared, and he continued about their evening/week without telling anyone of his visual disturbances. On Sunday, February 21, he experienced additional visual disturbances including double vision and dizziness, and we had him visit a local ER for evaluation. He was discharged with a diagnosis of dehydration and vertigo. No scans were performed. The visual disturbances cleared up the following week and the only persistent symptom was a slight dizziness. An eye exam was performed on Friday, February 26 with no problems found. An MRI was performed on March 3, and he was diagnosed with the below conditions.   Impression (3/3/2021) 1. Small acute to subacute infarcts in the left splenium of the corpus callosum and parasagittal left occipital lobe. 2. Trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the parasagittal left parietal lobe. 3. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  He was admitted to the hospital and remained there until Saturday, March 6. Follow-up scans and testing were performed with no underlying reason for the stroke being determined. Prior to the stroke, he had been a very active individual with osteoarthritis as is only health complaint. He was not on any prescription medication prior to the stroke. While in the hospital, the tests for high blood pressure, high cholesterol (LDL 92 MG/DL), sugar inadequacies (glucose 93 mg/dl, A1C 5.7%), etc. came back without major concerns. His follow-up CT scans also did not reveal the stroke shown on the MRI. No inquiry was made by any of his doctors or hospital staff as to his COVID vaccination status/dates to even consider the connection. Below are the results of the last CT scans:  Impression (3/4/2021) 1. Age-related volume loss and white matter disease similar to prior exams. 2. Small infarct seen on MRI are not well seen on CT. 3. No acute intracranial abnormality demonstrated on the CT scan.  Impression (3/5/2021) 1. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. No significant change. 2. Periventricular white matter disease is likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

Reporter and her husband both received the first Pfizer Covid vaccine on 02Feb2021.The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On11Feb2021, patient experienced dry heaves, pain and bloating in his stomach, his extremities felt cold and he was shivering, had night sweats and wasn&#39;t eating or drinking. He has been feeling progressively worse since Feb 11th, but she stated she has been taking his temperature and he did not had a fever but had been very thirsty. He had not been able to walk the last couple of days and had to use his wheelchair. Last night on 10Feb2021, he probably drank gallons of water due to his excessive thirst. His doctor told him to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen, which he did, but it didn&#39;t help. His symptoms have progressed such that the reporter dropped her husband off at the ER today. Reporter stated that he now did have a fever and is awaiting results of a chest x-ray and lab work (performed on 16Feb2021). He was having difficulty breathing, but his oxygen levels were normal. Reporter read online about two people in (city) developed transverse myelitis after receiving a Covid vaccine, but she was not sure which vaccine they received. She was calling to report this information to Pfizer and to see if these types of reactions have been reported and at 10 days post initial vaccination. The patient Is currently in the emergency Room and has not been able to eat for 5 days. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                history is a bit complex. I had had occassional r shoulder pain in the past without a diagnosis or specific  Rx. 2 days before 2nd dose, i b raised upper L ulna. 2 days post 2nd dose, rather severe olecranon pain developed dwith expuisite tenderness and mild swelling, but no fever. Subsequently over a period of days and weeks, I developed worsening right and then left shoulder and some neck pain and some additional hip and other pain. Shoulder tyenderness was diffuse and mostly muscular, Siginficant limitations of ROM withinability to raise arms. Pain was worst at night and on awakening with some relief with acetaminophen (no NSAIDS as on Xarelto).

An 81-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm (shoulder) on 25Mar2021 at 15:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication(s) included dimenhydrinate (DRAMAMINE) (Lot number: P118702 and Expiration date: 01Feb2023) 50 mg pills/100 count taken for motion sickness, patient mentioned that it did not help. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient mentioned that he and his wife had the COVID virus and they had to wait 90 days for their first shot. On 27Mar2021 in morning, the patient experienced dizzy and went to the doctor. The doctor checked his ears. On 05Apr2021 in morning, the patient experienced fluid in right ear, wax build up in left ear and ear infection. The patient was given drops for a week. On 12Apr2021, he went back to the doctor and reports that everything looked good. The doctor flushed the wax out of his left ear, but noted that he has an ear infection. The patient visited physician office due to events. The patient is taking is Amoxicillin 875 mg tablet, take one tablet by mouth every 12 hours. The patient would like to know if he should still take the, second vaccine, as he has 7 more days left for his antibiotic. The patient asked the doctor if he should take his second vaccine, and the doctor didn&#39;t know. The patient thinks the dizziness was the fluid and wax buildup in his ears. He believed it will get better and does not think the vaccine caused the dizziness. He is still dizzy at times but not as dizzy as he was. The wax is gone and the ear infection is not as bad as it was. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                I still have uncomfortable feeling in my arm/I was finally able to raise it above my head, my left arm, after two days but it was not comfortable to do it, it was painful; I have severe pain in my arm/it started hurting and then it continued to get worse and worse and it was severe; It was the worst pain I have ever had and I could not move my arm; It continued to get worse and that night I went to bed and I cannot sleep, it hurts so bad/I could not sleep on the right side or on a left side; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) first dose on 30Dec2020 10:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that I had the vaccine back a week and half ago on 30Dec2020 and was due to get the booster this month and wanted to report severe pain arm for two days. The patient stated that he had many vaccine (Unspecified Vaccine) over the years and have never had anything that hurts so bad after about six hours. The patient just wanted to know that was that normal. Consumer further stated, &#34;I took the vaccine about 10:30 in the morning and about four hours later, it started getting sore but that thing was normal you know some vaccines (Unspecified Vaccine) do that but along with that it started hurting about four hours after the vaccine and it continued to get worse and that night I went to bed and I cannot sleep, it hurts so bad. The patient even have thoughts about getting up and go in to the emergency room. It was the worst pain I have ever had and I could not move my arm. I could not sleep on the right side or on a left side and all I did was take Tylenol as prescribed and that helped a little bit but not much but I did not go to the emergency room, I am not going to do that but I felt like it because it hurts so bad but I made it through the night and next day it continued to hurt really bad. I just keep taking Tylenol every four hours and that continued for two days and then finally I was able to raise my arm up above my head without little pain, it was discomfort, but it was not hurting so bad.&#34; The patient stated that the event started about two hours later it started, it started hurting and then it continued to get worse and worse and it was severe, that is the reason why I am calling that it was severe. I wanted a shot or morphine to relieve myself that how bad it was.&#34; (no clarified further). The patient stated that the vaccine was given in my left arm only about one inch below the top of my shoulder which I think that might have been the problem, I don&#39;t know if you can answer that or not but I have never received the vaccine or shot anywhere near that area, it is always three or four inches down in my muscle, on my arm either on left or right, this was given in my left arm but this was given almost in my joint I am wondering if that would cause pain.&#34; The patient stated it was given only one inch below the tip above shoulder may be that is causing so much pain.&#34; The patient just wanted to report the severe pain, that was for two whole days and then it was subsided and it lasted for four days and I still have uncomfortable feeling in my arm. I was finally able to raise it above my head, my left arm, after two days but it was not comfortable to do it, it was painful.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in Jan2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. In the morning of an unspecified day in Jan2021, the patient was feeling very lethargic. The reporter (patient&#39;s wife) stated that they both received the vaccine at 2AM on Saturday and was asking if the event was common. It was also reported that the patient had severe tiredness all of a sudden after receiving the vaccine. The reporter stated that it had been about 55 hours since the shot and she wanted to know if this was a time frame to expect this; stated that it came on so sudden. Outcome of the events was unknown. Case was reported as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that an 82-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number was reported as &#34;EUO150&#34;/&#34;LU0150&#34;), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 13Apr2021 11:15 (at the age of 82-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included blood pressure, allergy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), liver genetic deficiency, and had allergy mice, cat, dust and trees. The patient previously took sulphur and aspirin and makes him bleed because his blood was already thin. Concomitant medications included amlodipine taken for blood pressure; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for allergy; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]) taken for an unspecified indication; all were start and stop date were not reported. An 82-year-old caller received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine yesterday (13Apr2021), around 11:15 am. He added he was monitored for 15 minutes post injection and then used the public transportation to run some errands and return home. He said he received the injection on his left arm had soreness in this arm after vaccination. He explained around 3-3:30 pm he was walking to get the bus and then felt very tired to the point he wanted to sit on the pavement. He also described it as feeling exhausted. He explained he was so tired on the bus that he was falling asleep and almost missed his stop. He said he also began having joint and muscle pain on the bus. He specified he got home around 4 pm and he then experienced tiredness, headaches, muscle and joint pains, hot flashes, chills, and felt nauseous but didn&#39;t vomit. He specified he felt so hot, he had to turn off the heat and remove his clothes, but then he had chills/cold chills and had to turn the heat back on and thought he had a fever. He said around 11 o&#39;clock he had appetite. He added he had cramping all through the night to the point he wanted to cry. He couldn&#39;t sleep. He specified the pain was in his hands, legs, feet, and joints. He also said he felt tired like he had worked for 12,000 hours and was not able to move. He said he had weakness to the point he couldn&#39;t get up to go to the bathroom. He said he had the headaches all through the night. He was feeling unwell, dizzy. He explained he felt like he was going to die; he was worried about his body. He said he still feels tired. They told him he would only have a sore arm, which he did, but everything else was sore too until about 08:00 today (14Apr2021). He explained that he didn&#39;t have all these issues before vaccination. He explained how disappointed he was with his reaction to the vaccine given that he was reluctant to the unapproved vaccine at beginning because he wasn&#39;t the person that take a lot of injection and medications, and so finally after his primary physician to influence him to get the vaccine. He mentioned he lives alone, healthy, vegetarian, never smoked, never took recreational drugs, does acupuncture, and takes little medications. He explained most people and his acupuncture doctor said he shouldn&#39;t get much reaction from the first dose and the reactions to the second dose are more prevalent. He added he was told that people have mainly experienced soreness in their arm after this vaccination with the first dose. He asked if his symptoms were reported after getting the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Everyone told him the first vaccine is a whiz. That it was easy. The second vaccine is the one that have side effects on. He also stated that he almost called to get an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Said that if he had these reactions with the first one, he does not want to take the second vaccine. Sometimes he regret that he have taken it now because he did not expect all of this to happen to him and they just told him that he will have a sore arm on left arm. He was in kind of shock to experience all of this and he was G6PD (Intent: History). He cannot take Sulfur and Aspirin because that makes him bleed because his blood was already thin but that would be no problem also have a liver genetic deficiency (Intent: History). He was allergic to mice, cat, dust and trees (Intent: History). So, he told all what he had that they knew in the beginning they said none of those things will affect. He take B12 (Intent: History) too once a month, he get injection for allergies for his cats and trees and grass once a month but they told him none of the things will affect him. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

Problem lasted for about a half hour. But a certain amount of weakness persisted and is still with me. Had one other wooziness episode on 1/24 at about the same time. This is new to me and may not be a reaction to the vaccination.

A 83-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 (age at vaccination: 83 years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient got the 1st vaccine dose &#34;today&#34; (23Jan2021)  but he had a fall and hit his head. Patient was now requiring TDAP. The clinical outcome of the event fell and his head was unknown. The reporting pharmacist was seeking information on the use with other vaccines, particularly the benefit vs risk of co-administering in an emergency case.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Became bloated with severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath and difficulty walking due to pain. Tried OTC stool softeners, miralax, prune juice and no relief. Seen in ER on 03/20/21 for abdominal pain, bloating and constipation. CT scans did not provide answers. Seen by GI specialist and had colonoscopy and EGD on 03/29/21 which did not provide answers on sudden stop of bowel movement. Almost a month later still not having bowel movements regularly despite taking Linzess as prescribed, still have abdominal pain and bloating daily, difficulty eating due to bloating and pain, have lost 7 pounds in the past 3 weeks and now remaining in bed more throughout the day due to pain/bloating. Becoming depressed and irritable which was NEVER a problem prior to the 2nd Pfizer covid-19 vaccine.

His body also seemed to want to walk backward on his heels when he stands up and he is wanting to fall (Feb2021). The patient has been taking his dog out every morning, but it is hard to do that now because he can&#39;t stand up that well (Feb2021). Therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the event congestion in his chest. Outcome of the event real deep coughing was not recovered while outcome of all the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                He believes the trouble started in the wake of his CoViD-19 immunizations (Moderna #1was given on 2/12/2021 and #2 was given on 3/12).  Both shots were given into the left arm.  He reports some soreness at the injection site on the left arm after both shots, but this soreness has persisted with some stiffness and difficulty abducting the arm beyond 90 degrees.  Two weeks after the first shot, his right shoulder started hurting also, worst distal to the glenohumeral fossa without radiation, also aggravated with abduction beyond 90 degrees.  Some soft tissue swelling was noted around the hand.   Simvastatin was discontinued with no improvement in symptoms.  Labs showed a sed rate of 54 mm/hr and C-reactive protein of 46 mg/L.  Blood cultures were drawn which were negative, suggesting no evidence of osteomyelitis flare.  He was started on prednisone 15 mg PO daily on 4/5/2021 with rapid and dramatic improvement in symptoms.  Presumptive diagnosis is polymyalgia rheumatica, but he had no previous history of same, and onset of symptoms was remarkably close to the immunizations.

This consumer (patient&#39;s wife) reported for an 84-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s husband) who received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158) on 10Apr2021 at right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included ongoing high cholesterol diagnosed a long time ago when he was very heavy at one point he was quite heavier than he was. Now he was skin and bones, ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed 10 years ago or longer and ongoing diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago, ongoing pacemaker and ongoing irregular heart beat and falls. The patient previously had sore arms at site after receiving the flu shot for immunization. Ongoing concomitant drugs included Carvedilol for high blood pressure, atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol, amiodarone (this is the medication that would cause an issue with the antibiotic if it was taken orally), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) to thin his blood, sitagliptin phosphate (JANUVIA) for diabetes, vitamin D3, cyanocobalamin (B12), ubidecarenone (CO Q10), sertraline (generic of an old drug called Zoloft) as something to calm him down. The patient was scheduled to get the second vaccine on 01May2021, however he was in the hospital and did not have his. They rescheduled the vaccine for this coming Saturday because he was still in the hospital. He was actually getting moved to a rehabilitation facility with intravenous antibiotics for a urinary tract infection and will not be able to get it. The patient was on an IV antibiotic which could not be administered orally do to the fact he has a pacemaker and irregular heart beat. The doctor told her that the oral medication would interrupt the spikes of the pace maker, his heart.  The reporter was wondering if her husband can still have the COVID vaccine while taking the antibiotic. She asks will it interfere with that medication. Will he have to start all over again with number one of the vaccine because he missed the vaccine in the allotted time span. The last time the patient was weighed he was 155, but he has not been eating since he has been ill. He had so many problems since he has been ill, he has been falling a couple times.  The reporter wanted to protect him from the terrible disease, but didn&#39;t want the injection into his body creating anymore problems than he already has. The doctor said that she thought the caller could take the patient out of the rehab facility for the day and get his vaccine and then bring him back. The facility said they would have to do research about that and get back to her. Caller states that her husband kept falling and had a fracture at the base of his spine, in addition to other problems, he has gout in one knee. She states that he would be standing up talking to her and the next thing she knew he was on the floor. She states that he has fell six times in a month. She states that she has become friends with the fire department because they came out so much. The falling occurred before he got the vaccine. She states he was fine when he went for the first vaccine and then the following week it started all over again, he couldn&#39;t walk. He had a physical therapist helping him strengthen his walking. She states that her husband says he fell and hurt his right knee while working with the physical therapist and the physical therapist said no, no, no, he didn&#39;t fall, he had a strap wrapped around him and the physical therapist caught him before he fell. Caller states that the physical therapist is 30 pounds lighter than her husband and doesn&#39;t know if he could of grabbed him before he hit the floor. She states that her husband was in a lot of pain and his knee swelled up, was very hot. She states that the doctor said it was inflamed. She states that she brought him back to hospital because they could not get him up and he could not walk. She couldn&#39;t pick him up, her son couldn&#39;t pick him up, her daughter couldn&#39;t pick him up and her son and daughter together finally got him up but he couldn&#39;t walk. She states that she called the emergency medical team. They said he has to go to the hospital and that was the last time he was at home. Has a walker and it takes a little while. She didn&#39;t know if he got the gout from that knee, but when they took out his fluid the following day you could of heard him screaming in the next county over. They were suppose to have the results but they didn&#39;t, they discharged him from the hospital. She states that he hasn&#39;t been able to come up with a breather of fresh air and feeling better.  Caller states that he was now taking a gout medication at the hospital and that they told her that her husband had a second fracture to lower spine. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I am being followed by the neurologist.  I still have balance issues and the facial drooping is gone.

An 85-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included epilepsy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Caller says her father in law hasn&#39;t had seizure in years, it was diagnosed when he was a kid, 60-70 years ago).  There were no concomitant medications.  The reporter is calling on behalf of her father in law. She said he had his first dose of the COVID vaccine recently, she pulled this number off of the paperwork today. She says that she believes he had a side effect for it, and also he was rescheduled for his second dose. She says his second dose was supposed to be in 21 days but they rescheduled him for it at 18 days instead. She says he got the first dose on 11Jan, and they rescheduled his next for the 29th. She says she wanted to know if this was correct or ok. The reporter says that the following day he ended up having massive diarrhea, that it caused him while he was on the commode to pass out and he fell and hit his face, the best she can tell he was alone at the time. She says he did not go to the hospital for that, he got up and cleaned himself off and took a nap, and the nurse next door checked on him later on. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

                                                No adverse effects for the first two weeks.  The morning of 2/7/21 he claimed he was not able to sleep the night before.  He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

On Sunday we went to The ER  near where we were and had x-rays and ultrasound of my knee. Dr. took a fluid sample for culture but said it looked clear. I have no history of arthritis nor any injury. I am an avid bike rider and suddenly cannot stand on my feet due to extreme pain.

                                                I experience muscle pain in my upper back muscles, both sides.  When I moved my head, I felp sharp stabbing pains which made me shout. I could not sleep much on March 8 evening. The pain persisted all day Tuesday March 9, 2021.  I called my ortho doctor and made a morning appointment for March 10, 2021 at 8:15am. I did not sleep much on evening of March 9. On Wednesday March 10 I went to the doctor. On this morning, the upper back muscles were OK, and the pain and spasms wer now in the neck. I could hardly move my head up or down and left and right. Dr. perscribed Methylprednazolone (4mg, 6-5-4-3-2-1 doses) and cyclobenzaprine 5mg (3x daily).  after 1 day and 1 dose, I feel I can movemy head a little farther without the stabbing pain.

An 85-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 09Feb2021 (Lot Number: EM9810) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2, at the age of 85-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 20Jan2021 (lot number: EL3302) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and experienced Vertigo, felt peculiar, nausea, dizziness/swimmy headed. The patient previously received the flu shot for immunization and experienced Sore arm. He is 85 and not familiar with all the goings on today but heard a report the other day and did not know there was such a thing as Vertigo. He thought that was just a movie. When he took the shot at (place name) in (county name) on 20Jan2021, soon thereafter, not that day but maybe next, he felt peculiar. It was just uneasiness and he did not feel right. That went on and on 09Feb2021, he got second shot and he got swimmy headed, but it has continued on since then and probably gotten worse, especially when he gets up in the morning. He has to hold on until he gets balanced or coordinated. It just doesn&#39;t seem right After he gets up and gets going, it is not as prevalent. But then sometimes it strikes him and he is just completely out of it. He later stated the peculiar feeling and swimmy headedness started the same day as the first injection, but he just did not really pay attention to it and thought it was just one of those things that you accept with getting older. Wife and he both went and he thought his feelings were merely from excitement or depletion or exhaustion. He felt like he had weakness and he just felt different. He got it at noon and waited for 15 minutes. Because of the events around him at the time, it did not register with him because it was the stress of driving 30 miles through expressway. Old people aren&#39;t used to driving that far. It got worse after the second shot and then he really knew something was wrong. When you are old, you have these feelings and pains and aches and all that stuff, and you just accept it as being old. It did not register with him until a couple of weeks ago when he heard it on TV about Vertigo and he said that is what he has. The swimmy headedness was really more noticeable after second shot, it brought it on stronger. He does not complain about things and thought it may just be getting old. He said it just kept on and getting a little worse and worse. Then he said something is not right and one day he bent over to look up and almost blacked out because of sensation in equilibrium or vision or whatever. He got scared and that was a couple of weeks ago. (name) was not cognizant of what was going on until he heard on television about Vertigo. One of the news channel mentioned or somebody mentioned it. It was just general things. He confirmed it was regarding someone who had gotten Vertigo after getting the vaccine but did not have a particular person to report on. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required. The outcome of the event dizziness aggravated and Weakness was not recovered, other events was unknown.

Out of concern for stroke he was sent by ambulance to Hospital. There he was found to have no evidence of stroke on MRI or CT angiogram. He was admitted to the hospital due to fever and  elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin, CRP) and transaminases. He was found to have a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG. His symptoms resolved the following morning and may have represented a TIA. He had many markers consistent with COVID-19 and his CT pulmonary angiogram did show ground glass opacities but no pulmonary embolism. It was difficult to assess if this was a reinfection with COVID-19, persistent PCR positivity from November, or an adverse event to the vaccine.

                                                pain in right groin; difficulty walking; arm soreness; redness on the toe of his left foot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). An 86-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL1284, expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; it was offered to him and he was in the Phase 1B category. Relevant medical history included ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was diagnosed 10-15 years prior reporting, had a watchman procedure on an unspecified date, and had used a cane to walk before. Concomitant medication included clopidogrel as a blood thinner from 15Jan2021 and ongoing, which he would take for 6 months. The patient previously took apixaban (ELIQUIS). It was reported that he had a watchman procedure and they took him off of apixaban and started him on clopidogrel. In 6 months, he would not have to take any blood thinners and would make an appointment with his physician. On 18Jan2021, at noon, the patient was experiencing pain in his right groin. As the day progressed it got worse. By night (18Jan2021), he was in extreme pain and had difficulty walking. He had to use a walker to walk. It had let up, but he still had pain in the groin of his right leg. The patient was asking if there were certain doctors that could assist him with this problem. He was no longer using a walker. He was using a cane instead. He used a cane to walk with before this, but not for this reason. He never had any real serious aching. He had a little soreness in his arm on an unspecified date in Jan2021, but nothing out of the ordinary. He didn&#39;t know his arm was sore until he rubbed it. He though it might have been on Sunday when he noticed it. He was not sure. Prior to this, he had redness on the toe of his left foot on an unspecified date in Jan2021. He was prescribed an antibiotic that he was still taking. He was unable to provide the name of the antibiotic. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of &#34;difficulty walking and redness on the toe of his left foot. The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient was recovering from the event &#34;pain in right groin,&#34; he was not recovered from the event &#34;difficulty walking,&#34; while the outcome of the events &#34;arm soreness and redness on the toe of his left foot&#34; was unknown.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that an 86-year-old male patient started to receive second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, lot# EN9581) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history includes diabetes. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications include carvedilol (COREG), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), repaglinide (PRANDIN), adenosine (TRICOR), metformin and amlodipine besilate (NORVASC). On an unknown date, the patient reported that blood sugar was 130 on that morning. He had his normal breakfast and went to get his shot within about an hour after getting a shot he was home and he was having my lunch. He was halfway through lunch he answered his doorbell and he got extremely dizzy. His lips and mouth felt numb and swollen. On 04Feb2021, his blood sugar was down to 50. There was no reason and no explanation for precipitated drop in blood sugar other than the fact that he had the Covid shot. Subsequently he spoke to cousin of his who is physician to heard of someone who had an adverse reaction like low blood sugar and was hospitalized. Nowhere in the side effects warning doesn&#39;t say anything about diabetic with low sugar and with low population over 65 it seems to me that would great number of people who have diabetes and low blood sugar problem. In case indeed of indication of adverse effect of covid. The patient advised that a warning should be on leaf. At least people have sugar tablets or some form of counteracting low blood sugar especially since these are 5-7 have driven to and he was just very thankful but he had to get the shot in (city). He was driving from (city) on 95 for 70 miles an hour. He would have got dizzy and headache and low blood sugar reaction while he was in transit. He was thankful that he got home in time for this not be a tragedy. It was reported that no other treatment was taken by the patient other than consuming large amount of orange peels. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Hospital Course:   COVID-19 pneumonia.  The patient was treated with convalescent plasma and IV remdesivir and completed the course.  He was treated initially with IV Decadron which has been transitioned to oral tablets for discharge to complete a 10-day course.   Chronic systolic heart failure.  Coronary artery disease.  Orthostatic hypotension in the setting of chronic hypertension.  The patient does have chronic systolic heart failure with an EF around 20% and is followed closely at the heart failure clinic.  He is chronically prescribed Lasix at 80 mg twice daily, however he did have some episodes of orthostatic hypotension during his hospitalization and has been unable to tolerate other guideline directed medical therapy due to his hypotension.  He is euvolemic at this time.  I have decreased his Lasix dosing to 40 mg twice daily to restart tomorrow morning.  His last dose of the 80 mg of Lasix was yesterday morning.  I do feel that in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased oral intake that he is more at risk for continued hypotension and dehydration aggressive diuresis.  He will remain on aspirin, Plavix, and simvastatin.   Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His last hemoglobin A1c showed good control at 6.3 on 3/3/2021.  His glipizide was held while inpatient.  He was on long-acting Lantus insulin 10 units with stable blood sugars in the hospital.  He was also on correctional lispro insulin.  His glipizide will be resumed upon discharge.

                                                Upon leaving the site my husband had great difficulty walking. Upon arrival home he seemed unusually confused and over the course of the next 15 hrs had bouts of incontinence. He was up 6 times during the night (usually only 1-2x) and unable to get himself out of bed without assistance. Walking continued to be very unsteady. I thought perhaps he had a mini-stroke. I relayed this to his PCP but he didn&#39;t think it was vaccine related

The patient noted that these symptoms began on day of admission and receiving his vaccine 7 days ago in which he noticed he had increased malaise and increasing DOE/SOB. Patient was noted to be hypoxic with SpO2 in 80s increasing to 90s on 2L NC and in atrial fibrillation on admission. Patient tested positive for COVID-19 on admission and was placed on dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 4 days, ceftriaxone 2g qd for 4 days, and doxycycline bid 100mg for 4 days. Patient improved over the 6 day stay until he was stable on room air at rest and upon ambulation at which time he was discharged home on 2/25/2021.

                                                The weeks following vaccination, the patient felt lethargic, dizzy, unstable on his feet. Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

                                                My father was given his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Feb. 13, 2021.  He went downhill the following week.  He fell 9 times and was very confused.  He was taken to the hospital on Feb. 20 and admitted that day.  He spent a week there.  His condition continued to deteriorate.  He was totally bedridden for a week.  His mental status deteriorated.  By Feb. 22, he was unable to talk, he drooled, and had to be fed.  He made  slow improvement later in the week.  We were never given any reason for his condition.  There was no infection, no stroke, etc.  He was discharged and sent to rehab on Feb. 27.  He remained there until April 8.   He is currently doing fairly well.  He uses a walker and gait belt in the house and is receiving home therapy.  He is not as independent as he was before.  His short term memory seems to be more impaired than it was previously.

                                                On Sunday afternoon, March 14, I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccination. On the morning of March 16 I had a sudden hit of fatigued and my left leg started going numb while doing some menial work in the yard, The numbness cleared when I went inside and laid down but some form of the fatigue persisted for several days. Then, on March 28, two weeks after the vaccine, I woke up to a leg severely swollen from toe to hip. I waited two days to see if it went down but it only got worse, swelling to double the size by volume. I went to the doctor and they sent me to the hospital for ultrasound, suspecting a blood clot. No blood clot was evident but there were multi swollen limp nodes in the upper leg area. The problem worsened and two days later I was sent in for a CTscan which now showed multi blood clots near the swollen limp nodes. I was barely able to walk as major pain persisted with no signs of decline. I am now on blood thinner. It has been 2 months since the vacination and my leg is still swollen the same amount (2X by volume).

                                                extremely lightheaded; like he was about to fall down; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. This physician reported similar events for 2 patients. This is the 1st of 2 reports.  An 89-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number; EL0140), intramuscular on the right arm on 30Dec2020 10:10 at single dose for vaccination.  Medical history included covid-19 on Jul2020 and had it fairly severe and almost died and he mentions he was overweight.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took flu shot (INFLUENZA VACCINE), a couple of months ago. He mentions he was in the military so he had a lots of shots in his life but he has never had a reaction like this.  The patient stated that on 30Dec2020 10:30, &#34;he became extremely lightheaded, like he was about to fall down. He sat down and is currently sitting down. This lightheadedness started about 20 minutes after the injection. When probed for the outcome, the caller explains it might be improving a little. The lightheadedness is not still not gone, but it has not worsened.  When probed for seriousness criteria, the caller explains he is just resting and sitting. He would say its not serious but it could be medically significant. He states he isn&#39;t sure if this is something that happens to just people who have had COVID before. He states none of his friends or relatives have this type of reaction. He lives in a retirement home and everybody is getting the injection. This is the second day of injections. He doesn&#39;t know if anybody had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine here&#34;. The outcome of the events were recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of lightheadedness and pre-syncope due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.   This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

An 89-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 12:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included vascular dementia; hypertension; hypothyroidism; malignant melanoma of back (resected/in remission); bladder cancer (surgery in Nov2018/in remission); prediabetic; chronic kidney disease stage 3 due to hypertension; and sleep related hypoxia. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included donepezil taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; memantine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; levothyroxine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lisinopril taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lovastatin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; fluoxetine taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and unspecified multivitamin tablet. The patient previously received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19) on 26Feb2021 07:45 PM in the left arm for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has not received other vaccine in four weeks. The first day after the shot, there were not any adverse reactions. The next morning at approximately 11:00 am, the reporter found patient laying on the floor next to his bed, eyes glazed over, disoriented, and he said &#34;he felt funny&#34;. The reporter got him sitting up leaning on the side of the bed and called. The EMT&#39;s came and checked his vitals. Within half an hour from  finding the patient laying on the floor, he seemed almost back to normal. However, since he is 89 years old, the patient was transported by ambulance. Blood was drawn, a urine sample was taken, a chest Xray, and a CT scan of his head and his spine were the labs that were run. All the labs came back normal. However, once patient got home after being in the ER for 5 hours, he is very weak, can barely stand and barely walk without human assistance and his walker. The way he is acting is more like he had a stroke. Onset of the events reported as 20Mar2021 11:15 AM. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient used walker due to can barely stand and barely walk; for other events, there was no treatment given. The patient was not diagnosed of Covid prior vaccination and has not been tested for Covid post vaccination.

                                                slightly dizzy; pain in arm slightly; His head was still just a little foggy; Unrestful night; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 89-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN5318), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in arm right (Injected into right shoulder in the muscle) on 10Feb2021 09:50 to 10Feb2021 09:50 (at the age of 89-years-old) as single dose for prevention (COVID-19 immunisation). Medical history included ongoing AFib (Diagnosed 7-10 years ago), sulfa allergy, ongoing to keep bowels soft and pliable, down from 210 lbs (he found out his wife had breast cancer, he lost the weight, prior receiving vaccine), bad ankles (uses a cane and walker and noticed he was having). Concomitant medications included warfarin at 5 mg daily (Started taking 7-10 years) for AFib; diltiazem hydrochloride at 180 mg daily (Started taking 2 years ago) for AFib and omeprazole at 20 mg daily (Taking for 7-10 years) to keep bowels soft and pliable and unspecified medication. They reported that he called Pfizer yesterday about the same question; however, today he would like to know if he can get a letter stating that it was permissible to get the vaccine 4 days short of the 21 days. Caller reports that he received first dose yesterday, and felt slightly dizzy afterwards and today he had pain in arm slightly Feb2021. Caller reports he had a sulfa allergy. Caller was scheduled for second dose on 27Feb2021. He received the first shot this morning. It went along nicely. He had two questions. He went back in to reschedule next appointment and the only thing they had available at (College name) was this month on 26Feb2021 or 27Feb2021, so he picked out the 25Feb2021, which he later stated was 26Feb2021. He had the shot this morning and it was only 15 days and he understands it was not supposed to be given until 21 days and wanted to know if that was true. His second question was after he had injection and he told them he was only allergic to Sulfa, they told him not to worry about it that there were so little problems with that. Before he got it, he had a sleepless night. He said he was old and he was worried about all kinds of things. He started talking to the guy the drove him over. He noticed he was a little dizzy and he probably could drive but should not. They dropped him off at his place and he was only one block away. When he got home, he drank some water and ate lunch and still feels a little bit out of it. He had a feeling if he got a good nights sleep, he would be fine. But, he wondered if it was related to the Sulfa allergy. He was down from 210 lbs. It just happened when he found out his wife had breast cancer that he lost the weight, which was prior to receiving the vaccine. She just passed away 6 weeks ago and had bone and breast cancer. He was bending and his back was starting to arch. He used to be 5&#39; 11.5&#34;. That was before the vaccine. This has been happening for years. He has bad ankles and uses a cane and walker and noticed he was having more trouble right after he got the vaccine. Now, he was not having any more problems than usual. His head was still just a little foggy on 2021. When getting up, he stated he did not fall. He had a very unrestful night on 2021 and it could be related to that. He heard second dose should be 21 days and not 15 days. He provided on his vaccine card. They were having an influx of cases in his area and his wife and he had planned to get the vaccine as soon as they offered it. He said the reason he takes Omeprazole was his insides, all through his hose system, every once in a while he had some problems, and it started to bleed, so this was something to keep it soft and pliable. He was allergic to Sulfa. He does not have the name of medication, manufacturer, lot or expiration. The outcome of event slightly dizzy was recovering and other events was unknown.
