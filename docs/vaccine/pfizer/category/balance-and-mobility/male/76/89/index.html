                                                Assessment: Individual stated he was feeling lightheaded approximately four minutes after receiving his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine via IM injection in his upper arm. Individual was seated at the time and was about to move from the vaccination station to the check out desk.  PT attempted to stand and said, ?Oh, I don?t feel so good?, after which vaccinator inquired with PT on what was wrong. After a brief assessment, notified personnel of the situation. Individual remained with the vaccinator, who obtained a set of vital signs and continued an assessment.  Vitals: (as I recollect, I gave the post it to the check out staffers who monitored the individual prior to his departure) BP: 126/54, P: 78, RR: 18, pale and sweating across his brow area. Denied chest pain, difficulty breathing, nausea, tingling, headache, stated only symptom was lightheaded ness which was dissipating. Provided the individual with bottled water to sip on, which he did. Individual?s last oral intake was at ~0845 PTA at the clinic, a normal breakfast of eggs, toast and coffee. Individual stated he had several cups of coffee but had not had anything else to drink that morning. Individual receives dialysis three days per week. He had an appointment Wednesday, next appointment is Friday. Individual did not have anyone driving him to the clinic, stated he would be fine and did not have anyone to come pick him up. He stated he was feeling better already.  After approximately 8 additional minutes, individual stated he thought he could get up and move to the check out station.  Individual was able to stand an ambulate to the check out line. Upon arrival at check out, transferred the individual to the check out personnel and Exit workers to monitor the individual?s condition for the remainder of the 30 minutes.

Next morning 3/25, woke up and tried to get out of bed.  Legs were so weak they gave out and I fell out of bed on the floor.   I had no strength to get back up to get on the bed.  My wife could not lift me, so she called 911 for a &#34;lift assist&#34;.  Paramedics were told I received the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine the day before, so they picked me up off of the floor and put me back in bed.  They took my vitals - blood pressure was 116/73 and temperature was still 102.6.  Paramedics offered to take me to the hospital but I refused.  Paramedics told my wife that if my breathing became labored, she should get me to the ER or call 911 again.    I was not able to get out of bed the whole day on Thursday 3/25, because I was so weak I could not stand up, and I also had body aches and had to use a urinal because I could not walk to the bathroom.  My wife gave me Tylenol and the fever finally broke late evening of Thursday 3/25 and I started to feel a little bit better.  I had not eaten all day, but my wife made sure I stayed hydrated with water.  On Friday morning 3/26 I was able to sit up on the side of the bed, and I was able to walk with the assistance of a cane to the bathroom.  Extreme fatigue affected me all day Friday, but I did feel better.  Fever did not come back after it broke.  Saturday 3/27 - still experiencing extreme fatigue, but feel better overall.

A 76-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EP7534), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Mar2021 08:30 (at 76 years old), single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Low thyroid, Possible atrial fibrillation,  there was a question of whether he had atrial fibrillation in years past but it was never determined with certainty whether the caller actually had atrial fibrillation. He went to see a cardiologist years ago for the possible atrial fibrillation but the tests came back negative; Knees were so painful. Every time his family went overseas, he got tetanus, typhoid, diphtheria, and other vaccines. The vaccines were all done in military facilities.  He received these vaccines somewhere between the ages of 0 and 15 years old. Patient&#39;s tetanus and diphtheria booster in 2007 caused a sore arm. The shingles vaccine in 2012 caused a sore arm. The Prevnar-23 vaccine in 2013 or 2014 caused a sore arm. He was adopted so he doesn&#39;t know his family history. He heard anecdotal evidence that his mother suffered a stroke and died at 61 but that his father lived apparently well into his 90&#39;s.The patient had his first dose of bnt162b2 for COVID-19 immunisation on 23Feb2021, left arm, lot number: EN6200. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine; vitamin c [ascorbic acid]; chondroitin sulfate sodium, glucosamine hydrochloride; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3); aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid].  Patient experienced 15 hours after he received his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 17Mar2021, he had a stroke.Stroke occurred at 11:30 PM on 17Mar2021. He was admitted on 18Mar2021 as the stroke occurred so late on 17Mar2021. He was discharged late in the afternoon on 22Mar2021. He has vastly improved. He is not 100% recovered but that he has made great strides and great improvements. He was in great shape before the stroke on 17Mar2021. For a guy his age, he has the vitals of a 19 year old.    he was walking 2 to 3 miles or biking for 30-45 minutes daily, lifting weights three times a week, and doing yoga before the stroke. He was in good shape and that he thinks that may have had a part in bringing him back quickly from the stroke.   we are only a month in post-stroke, and that he is not 100% but he is very close, probably 90% back.He was started on Atorvastatin and Clopidogrel after his stroke. He takes the vitamins as a prophylactic for overall health. The glucosamine and chondroitin seems to have helped his knee pain immensely. He has been wearing a heart monitor since his stroke on 17Mar2021. He noted an irregular heartbeat once when he woke up about a week ago. The irregular heartbeat occurred maybe on 15Apr2021. There was just one episode of irregular heartbeat. All of his stroke assessments kept improving and getting better while he was hospitalized after his stroke on 17Mar2021.The hospital was performing CT scans and MRIs practically daily while in the hospital.One of the CT scans that he got showed a brain bleed. He thinks the CT scan that showed a brain bleed was after tPA, tissue plasminogen activator, had been administered. The repeat CT scans and MRIs were because the medical staff wanted to ensure that there was no further damage or bleed after the tissue plasminogen activator was administered.One CT scan showed that he had a small bleed in the cerebellum. The bleed in his cerebellum was probably because of the tissue plasminogen activator that was administered but it doesn&#39;t seem to have any lasting effects.Caller queried for product details of tissue plasminogen activator but he was unable to provide as it was administered in the hospital.His balance is back, he is riding a bike again, he is going for walks, and he does not feel dizzy.His balance returned probably about 2 weeks ago.On 17Mar2021, he was so dizzy that he couldn&#39;t raise himself up in bed.   the dizziness was slow to resolve and probably resolved in the last week.The minor infarct on his first CT scan performed after his stroke on 17Mar2021 may have occurred previously.The hospital staff performed a CT scan after the patient arrived at the hospital following his 17Mar2021 stroke.Hospital staff administered the tissue plasminogen activator after the first CT scan and that another CT scan was performed 12 hours later after tissue plasminogen activator administration. The CT after the tissue plasminogen activator administration showed the small bleed in his cerebellum. He has had video visits with occupational therapy, physical therapy, his neurologist, and he had one scheduled for a speech therapist but she didn&#39;t want to talk to him.His therapists and physician say that he is ok and there is no reason for them to see the caller again. He had one follow up with his occupational therapist and the therapist told the caller that she didn&#39;t see any reason to see the caller again. The outcome of the event Stroke was recovering; Cerebellar bleeding, infarction was unknown, other events was recovered.

I could think correct and carry on a conversation.  Took 2 Ibuprofen, drank 8oz of water and laid down for a half hour or so.  After about 40 minutes my eyes started coming back in focus.  My left eye was not seeing some cobweb stands but eventually stopped and became normal.  I then ate some food and everything seemed to be ok.  As I write this 5 hours after the above incident nothing more has happened.  My arm does not hurt either.  No other symptoms of any kind are occurring.

There was also minimal nausea and headache, intermittent. Slept well, but had a very difficult time walking from bed to toilet during early morning  due to the symptoms. Slightly improved by 7 AM in the morning. Intermittent episodes of the vertigo during Friday and Saturday, decreasing in intensity. Was able to exercise on stationary bike on Friday and Saturday PM. No symptoms Sunday AM (now). Will symptoms recur?

He went to the hospital with his wife on 3/1/2021.  He stated &#34;I think I&#39;m going to die&#34;.  Patient had been off Cymbalta  for 3 days completely- treating neuropathy (previous daily medication that his primary physician advised him with weaning down the dose).  The patient was manic and had tangential thoughts- from crying/angry to laughter.  It is believed that the agitation could be due to medication withdraw.

A 77-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1686; expiration date: unknown) at 77-year-old vaccination age via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 31Jan2021 13:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to artificial crabmeat, NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), HBP (high blood pressure), GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease) and BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia).

I could barely get out of bed (an awkward rollover did it).  My tongue was numb (still is) and raw from the presumed chewing on it.  Walking was slow and painful as all muscles hurt.  If I sneezed or coughed, my back would hurt.  Those last problems are still true. I periodically cough up phlegm and lacking a good place to spit it out, I just swallow it.  I have for the first time in my life been using a walker for stability. Right arm is almost useless due to pain.

A 77-years-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3246), via an intramuscular route of administration in the left arm on 28Jan2021 at 9:30 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included low iron from unspecified date to ongoing (diagnosed about two years ago). Concomitant medication included iron infusion taking for about 2 years, they cannot seem to straighten it out, states it is uncurable. He had too many red blood cells due to bone marrow, he got on iron infusions, and if his red blood cells gets to high, then they will perform phlebotomy to have them taken out. This was his second year receiving the infusions. He goes in once a week and they test him and sometimes he was able to get the infusion and sometimes he had to wait till the next week. Stated they took a pint of blood out of him about a week and a half ago. He goes every Thursday and his red blood cell count was 15.7. The weight of the patient was 205-206. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On 28Jan2021, the patient had no problem with his arm, not really too many problems at all, except after he got home, the back of his left leg above the knee and back of his calf feels a little weird, tender. Stated he had a crazy feeling on the bottom of his heel, it was killing him, he can barely walk, he did not have this prior to getting the vaccine. He was worried about getting the second dose. Advised to contact hcp. Him and his wife have their second shot scheduled for 28Feb2021. He was told that it can be given up to 4 days ahead or anytime after. He read that Pfizer recommends 21 days between doses The feeling in his heel has stayed the same. States he slept ok. He does had a bad back. When he woke up and tried to put the weight on his left leg he can walk a couple of steps and his heel was killing him. Pain shooted up his leg. It was hard for him to walk. The back of his knee and calf are not really that bad, but he can feel it, he can barely walk. Caller asked have there been any reports of this and how long does it take for the pain to disappear. Caller stated the clinic where they received the vaccine told them the second dose can be scheduled 4 days before 21 days or a week or so after 21 days. Caller also asked if that was going to cause a problem if the second dose is scheduled 28 days after dose 1? they responded saying that &#34;The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination series was 2 doses given 3 weeks apart. This was how Pfizer-BioNTech studied the vaccine. Provided disclaimers that Pfizer was unable to speak outside of the EUA fact sheet and Pfizer was independent of a company guidelines and recommendations. He hoped the heel pain was going to go away and it was something from the vaccine, not something else. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

A 78-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 (around 11:00 or 11:30 AM) on left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered at a military facility. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. He did not receive other vaccines 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient had his 1st dose on 12Jan2021. He was fine that day, but on the 13Jan2021, he woke up and was dizzy. He stated that he had no problem after having the shot, 15 minutes later, he had no problems; but, the next day he began having vertigo and dizziness. Vertigo and dizziness began 13Jan2021 at about 8:00 AM. This has continued the past 3 days. It is getting better, but he is wondering if that is a big problem. At the time of report, it&#39;s getting better but still have it. He asked if he should be concerned. It is quite a bit improved but it&#39;s still there. If he had to drive a car for an emergency, he thinks he could do it, but he wouldn&#39;t volunteer for that right now. He looked up all that stuff and it says that 20% of the people who take it have that.

                                                Lightheadedness; Headache; tightness in his chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EK4176, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm/ shoulder area on 15Jan2021 at 11:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, patient has epilepsy that has been controlled since 1977; and issues with his blood pressure. He has no allergies. Concomitant medications included phenobarbital and phenytoin (DILANTIN), both for epilepsy. He takes HTZ TRI something, it is a long word but is basically 2 diuretic. He is also being followed by a cardiologist. Patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient got the COVID injection 2.5 hours ago on 15Jan2021 and after that he had a slight case of lightheadedness. He was instructed to drink water and walk if he was able, he did that and it helped. The patient relays that he was fasting that morning and thinks that had some degree of relatedness in the lightheaded feeling. He ate lunch and the light headedness resolved but now he has a slight headache. He was reading the paperwork and on the form under severe reactions, it mentions dizziness, weakness, and difficulty breathing. While he is breath ok, he has noticed a slight degree of tightness in his chest. He did not see this listed but wants to know if this is normal or if it would be related to the difficulty breathing. His main concern is if this is a severe reaction. He had lab work done prior to getting the vaccine, then none afterward. The events did not require visit to emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the event &#39;lightheadedness&#39; was recovered while unknown for the other events.

By the next morning (Friday 2/12), he was so bad next morning that wife called 911 - He reports that he was there and then not there and was losing track of train of thought. He was taken to ER via EMS, where his HR was initially 15 - He was admitted to hospital - initially a temporary pacer was placed, then a permanent one on Monday, 2/22. He has had other episodes like this in past 13 mos. PCP referred him to neurologist and EENT. Neurology work-up, including MRI and 72 hr EEG were unremarkable, although he learned retrospectively that there was a time during EEG where HR was only 35. EENT found no auditory or other issues . *MD in ER told him that if issues were not neuro in nature, they were probably cardiac.

                                                On March 2, he woke up feeling bad and had a fever of 102.7. He took tylenol and liquids all day and the fever came down to around 100. The next morning he woke up complaining of excruciating pain in his left arm (site of the injection). I couldn&#39;t stand to have anything touch it, couldn&#39;t move it and couldn&#39;t sleep because of the pain. The next morning he woke up very weak, wasn&#39;t able to speak clearly, wasn&#39;t making sense. He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately. put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn&#39;t do it at that hospital.  He was transferred to another hospital.  The doctors at that hospital determined the pacemaker was not the source.  It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.  He lived another 2 weeks but never was able to recover. Until the day he was put on paliative care, he expressed pain in the arm where he had received the vaccination. He died at 5:30 a.m. on April 1, 2021.

No breathing problem but did feel fatigued.  After coughing up in morning, no other phlegm all day.  Then, for a week, I had trouble with balancing,  like walking after too many drinks.  That has essentially resolved itself.  OK now.  Really don&#39;t know if adverse reaction or possibly a &#39;bug&#39;.  Thought it best to let you know.

                                                After duing light work on Saturday morning. I sat down for a few minutes and felt a little light headed.  My stomach became quisy and I had to go into the bathroom, became nauseated and had to vomit. I had a quisy stomach most of the balance of the day.  I experiecnced a restless night. However, by mid-morning  Sunday I began to feel better and have had no additonal inegative effect.  The only other  unexplained  item was that on Sunday I checked my blood presure and it was 154/ 85. This is very unusual,  as due to the nifedipine I take for my DES, my average for years is around 125/80.  Today, Tuesday, I checked it again and it still  at 158/87.  I have an appointment with my cardiologist  in 2 weeks and will discuss this with him.

                                                About 5 days after the Vaccine shot I noticed that my finger joints were stiff.  I couldn&#39;t make as tight of a fist, especially my right hand.  When I open my right hand my ring finger would hang up and not extend with the others.  It would lock up half way open  and then extend the rest of the way.  The condition has not changed since.  I had my second shot on 02/10/2021 at 2pm.  I didn&#39;t see a doctor about it since it is not critical except for a little lose of dexterity.

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, dose 2, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostate cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and major radial prostatectomy from 04Feb2021 to an unknown date. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced chills, low grade fever and fatigue. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of BNT162B2. The patient was fine, had no problems until 15Mar20201 (4 days afterwards), the patient stated, &#34;I started getting chills, shaking uncontrollably , nausea, fatigue, a little bit of everything. I wouldn&#39;t be calling you but this has not subsided. It&#39;s been 3 weeks now and I&#39;m not feeling well. It ebbs and tides. I&#39;ve been taking a diary. I went to the ER last Monday because I was wheezing in the morning and had shortness of breathe in between all the other symptoms. They did all kind of blood tests, covid test which was negative, chest x-ray showed bronchitis. Blood work and ultrasound of my bladder with unknown results. They sent me home with a inhaler, steroid and an antibiotic and every day since then it seems like at night 9, or 10 o&#39;clock I start feeling better and sleep through the night. My fever is 97.7 degrees fahrenheit but about 2, 3 or 4 o&#39;clock my fever ticks up a little and I start to feel lousy, my stomach feels. I feel like I have hot flashes; a feeling of warmth with achiness and lack of appetite. So I take my Tylenol 7 or 8 o&#39;clock at night my temperature is 97.7F. I haven&#39;t had 1 good day since. I&#39;ve been to my doctor, ER, I&#39;ve talked with the CDC. What information do you have for people who have had long term symptoms/side effects? What am I supposed to do? Someone from Pfizer needs to give me advice. If not I&#39;ll go to  the news network. I don&#39;t feel well. It&#39;s directly related. No one has given me relief or help. It&#39;s impacting my life. I&#39;ve been sick every day.  Is there someone above you who can tell me what to do? I took their (Pfizer&#39;s) vaccine that was recommended. It was your vaccine. Not mine. Someone has to have an answer for me. Unless you want to go and have lawsuit and the news. Just think about it, if you had to go through the symptoms of having the flu everyday. Please relay this to someone. If I don&#39;t heard back within a week, then I&#39;m going ballistic. It&#39;s not going to be pretty. Someone has to get back to me to help. I want someone to tell me that I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m not the only experiencing this. There has to be an answer. I took your vaccine. You are responsible. I want to know. I can&#39;t be the only one in the whole world who is feeling like this. I&#39;ve been to the ER and the doctors. I&#39;ve had every side effects but theirs go away in a few days, but mine hasn&#39;t. I need advice, that I&#39;m not nuts, something that will help me get better. I want to feel better. It&#39;s effecting my family my life. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd? I can&#39;t be the only one? Someone has to know something. They (drug companies) like to hide the facts. I am sick because I took BNT162B2 vaccine. I need someone to get back to me.&#34; After the second dose of BNT162B2, the patient has been experiencing an achy feeling, heat throughout the body, shivering, shaking, trouble walking, and some fever.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients (father and mother). This is the first (father) of the two reports.  A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Dose 1) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 26Mar2021 (batch/lot number: ER8727) at 79 years old as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing AFib (atrial fibrillation) diagnosed between 1 and 2 years ago. Patient also has a pacemaker from an unknown date. Patient was exposed to COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) oral from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 5 mg twice a day taken for AFib (atrial fibrillation). On 07Apr2021, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to a fall; he fell in the bathroom and passed out. The patient is on Eliquis, so they were worried about bleeding. He tested positive for COVID on 07Apr2021, this was the same day he was admitted to the hospital. He was discharged on 10Apr2021 and was improving. It was reported that the reporter (patient&#39;s son) tested positive for COVID on 27Mar2021, so it was likely his parents were exposed or infected prior to their first dose of the vaccine. The reporter confirmed he has not been vaccinated. The patient was due to get the second shot today, but the reporter cancelled the appointment since his dad was still in quarantine. The reporter heard different things about when to get the second dose, everyone says to wait 90 days, they&#39;re getting mixed information, then he has heard 3 weeks is long enough to wait. The reporter wanted to know when his dad can get the second dose of the vaccine after having the COVID-19 infection. The patient is recovering from &#34;he fell in the bathroom and passed out.&#34; Outcome of the event &#34;tested positive for Covid&#34; was unknown.   This case involves a Product Complaint: Consumer reported that his father and mother tested positive for Covid infection on 07Apr2021 after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 26Mar2021. It was not provided if a sample of the product was available to be returned, if requested and if packaging was sealed and intact.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021443810 same reporter, same drug, same event, different patient

An 80-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNtech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL1283) , via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 01:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included open heart surgery 11 years ago, covid-19 from Jul2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received bnt162b2 yesterday, with no problems. However today (18Jan2021), in 15 minutes after waking up at 11, he had the chills really bad, that went away, then he went to sleep again and woke up and he had all the symptoms on the paperwork, he had dizziness, headache, he&#39;s hardly ever had a headache ever. He had aches and pain. Caller states that he was just asking right now about another company, and their vaccine in started with an M, and her daughter is at a girls home, because she has a epileptic type thing, and this particular shot, that started with M, the nurse called over, and the problems that he is having he explained to the nurse is like when he had the virus previously about in Jul2020, when he had the virus he was in hospital for a week, because he had to get rid of the virus, and they got him out of that. Now he took this shot yesterday and the next day is when he got all these symptoms, he&#39;s tired, cant walk, muscle pain, had chills not any more, pain in the knees, everywhere really, he couldn&#39;t get any position to go back to sleep, his back knees elbow joint pain. Since he had these things, the nurse at the girls home, told his wife if having these problems he can take 300 mg of Zinc, 1000mg of Vitamin C, and 2000IU or Vitamin D, the same thing, that amount, he asks will it over come the symptoms. Another person felt good after getting those, it helped him he does state however that is what the person took when he actually had the Covid 19 Virus. Caller states that he received paperwork after the vaccine from the (State), it has a bunch of blocks asking if he has this or that symptom. His First dose was 17Jan2021 at 1:15, then on 07Feb2021 if this Second Dose. All the side effects started Today 18Jan2021. His doctor said he&#39;s in good health. He did have open heart surgery 11 years ago. The patient reported he is 5 feet 8 and a half inches, he is shrinking. He stated, &#34;I was good until this morning, it hit me like I had the virus. The product they gave me at the (State) was the Pfizer-biontech vaccine. I had all the symptoms except vomiting/throwing up. I got all the other symptoms. no matter which way I turned it was hurting, knees, everything was hurting really bad. I was dizzy and weak so I don&#39;t want to walk around too much. I had muscle pain, joint pain, fever, headaches, chills, never went away. I hurt everywhere. I am really weak. My eyes are hurting. My daughter is in a girls home (paralysis problem). They had the vaccine from the another company and they have heard so many negative stuff so they decided they did not want to, when my wife told her I was having these problems. I had the virus 4 months, the nurse told me to take 300mg of zinc, 1000mg vitamin C and 2000mg vitamin D (the person took that when he had the disease). Should I take this stuff? Is there any information on that? what&#39;s in this? protein? my wife got the disease. They said she had enough antibodies. How long is the immunity? When does it start?&#34; The outcome of the event chills was resolved, of other events was unknown.

The next day my husband complained about pain in his entire body and weakness, and I had the same.  In the evening he collapsed falling out of his wheelchair.  He tried for an hour to sit down back in his wheelchair with my help, but he couldn&#39;t.   He agreed that I call 911.  Two nurses took him to Emergency Room at Hospital and didn&#39;t allow me to go with him.  In the morning on Saturday, he was transferred to Room at Hospital and the next day to the Intensive Care Room, where he sadly passed away on Tuesday April 13 at 4:22 am.

An 81-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246, expiry: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 11:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included retired, he became allergic to penicillin when he was 17 year old and hasn&#39;t taken it since, lost his taste and smell, potassium is high sometimes - the doctor recommend he cut down on banana and potatoes, extra heart beat, stomach acid, and thyroid disorder. Ongoing concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium - has been taking it for a year and a half to two years for thyroid, metoprolol succinate - has been on it about a year and half because an EKG showed he had an extra heart beat, and omeprazole capsule - been on it two or three years for stomach acid. The patient previously took trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy. After having a Pfizer shot on Saturday, he had a reaction - dizziness. His wife also received the COVID vaccine but did not have any reaction. He sat in the office for 15 minutes like he was supposed to. He drove home and was fine. Two hours later he was so dizzy he couldn&#39;t stand up. He was holding onto things to walk through the house. That was two hours after he took the vaccine. After that he thought it would go away in a day. All day yesterday, which was the second day, he was still dizzy. If he laid down the bed would float. It was an awful experience. He received the vaccine at 11:45am on 09Jan2021. Two hours later is when it started. He had to hold onto the rail to get up there. If he gets up quick it is still there. He just had blood work and was due back in Apr for check up. He hasn&#39;t had taste and smell for four years or better. He lost his taste and smell and never got it back. He doesn&#39;t know what caused that. He hasn&#39;t been sick. Outcome of the event dizziness was recovering, for the other events was unknown.

Work done couple of weeks ago. I have not gotten the answers yet&#34;. Also stated that he had lab test because he has acid. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 15Jan2021 18:00 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL3249) for covid-19 immunisation.

Dizziness started in the morning 17Jan2021 when he got up he said good morning and then said he would bring her back a cup coffee then he became very dizzy and leaned against the wall for support and then he fell, he was okay but he fell. He did go the emergency room because he fell and hit was head and it was bleeding. They told him it was not related to the vaccine but it is one of the things that are on the form that could happen. She says it was okay if it caused it she is just looking for a reason.  Now today (18Jan2021) he feels fine she wants to know what causes that side effect. She says she is supposed to be getting her vaccine too. He had one bad dizzy spell and then it went away, and she thinks he got kind of nauseous with it. It says this can happen, it said it could happen right after but in his case it did not, it happened within probably 34 hours or something. Outcome of the event dizziness has recovered completely at this point. Outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                Patient is a 81 y.o. gentleman with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma, urinary retention for which he self catheterizes twice daily, as well as recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation that presents complaining of increasing weakness and falls.  Patient fell 2/18 pm trying to get out of bed and he took about 20 minutes to get himself to a position where he could pull himself back up.  Again 2/19 he was trying to get up and his legs were too weak to carry him and he fell to the ground.  He needed assistance to get up and family asked him to come to emergency room for evaluation.  He has been feeling poorly for about a month, with poor appetite and has lost about 15 pounds.  He is not nauseated or short of breath and has no cough.  He was apparently treated for UTI about 4 to 6 weeks ago after a visit to urgent care.  He has since been to a different urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was referred to a cardiologist who is planning to do a stress test in a few weeks.  I believe he is on Eliquis now.  In ER he was found to have significant pyuria and bacteriuria and was given a dose of Rocephin.  Renal function shows worsening from levels in December although it is pretty stable over the past month from looking through other labs.

This condition has persisted since then and has not improved significantly.

                                                My RA began to really act up.  My whole body stiffened up-(legs, hands, hips, back).  Lower back made it hart to bend over, Rt shoulder had a swelling and hurt at a pinch point in shoulder, my rt hip hurt when I walked more than 0.25 miles, my hands swelled and could not use hand well. Did not initially link to Covid shot, so called my Rheumatologist on the sixth day that the symptoms continued.  Received prescription to reduce muscle  tension and an anti inflamatory.  However, a couple of days after talking to my doctor and before taking any of the prescribed meds, the symptoms went away and since that time, my RA is back to typical old symptoms and pain level.

                                                Patient developed a syncopal episode one day following the vaccine.  Without warning, he fell to the ground, losing control of bowel and bladder, although no seizure activity noted at the time.  He transiently lost consciousness and then woke up confused and combative.  Brought to emergency room and admitted with multiple rib fractures.  Initial brain imaging was negative but 24 hours later, noted to have small hemorrhagic brain contusion in left frontal/temporal region and a small subdural hematoma.  One day later, there was not noted to be any extension of the hemorrhage/hematoma.

                                                Patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine at on Monday, February 15. That evening, he experienced visual disturbances with slightly blurred vision. Not thinking anything of it at the time, the vision cleared, and he continued about their evening/week without telling anyone of his visual disturbances. On Sunday, February 21, he experienced additional visual disturbances including double vision and dizziness, and we had him visit a local ER for evaluation. He was discharged with a diagnosis of dehydration and vertigo. No scans were performed. The visual disturbances cleared up the following week and the only persistent symptom was a slight dizziness. An eye exam was performed on Friday, February 26 with no problems found. An MRI was performed on March 3, and he was diagnosed with the below conditions.   Impression (3/3/2021) 1. Small acute to subacute infarcts in the left splenium of the corpus callosum and parasagittal left occipital lobe. 2. Trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the parasagittal left parietal lobe. 3. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  He was admitted to the hospital and remained there until Saturday, March 6. Follow-up scans and testing were performed with no underlying reason for the stroke being determined. Prior to the stroke, he had been a very active individual with osteoarthritis as is only health complaint. He was not on any prescription medication prior to the stroke. While in the hospital, the tests for high blood pressure, high cholesterol (LDL 92 MG/DL), sugar inadequacies (glucose 93 mg/dl, A1C 5.7%), etc. came back without major concerns. His follow-up CT scans also did not reveal the stroke shown on the MRI. No inquiry was made by any of his doctors or hospital staff as to his COVID vaccination status/dates to even consider the connection. Below are the results of the last CT scans:  Impression (3/4/2021) 1. Age-related volume loss and white matter disease similar to prior exams. 2. Small infarct seen on MRI are not well seen on CT. 3. No acute intracranial abnormality demonstrated on the CT scan.  Impression (3/5/2021) 1. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. No significant change. 2. Periventricular white matter disease is likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) first dose on 30Dec2020 10:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that I had the vaccine back a week and half ago on 30Dec2020 and was due to get the booster this month and wanted to report severe pain arm for two days. The patient stated that he had many vaccine (Unspecified Vaccine) over the years and have never had anything that hurts so bad after about six hours. The patient just wanted to know that was that normal. Consumer further stated, &#34;I took the vaccine about 10:30 in the morning and about four hours later, it started getting sore but that thing was normal you know some vaccines (Unspecified Vaccine) do that but along with that it started hurting about four hours after the vaccine and it continued to get worse and that night I went to bed and I cannot sleep, it hurts so bad. The patient even have thoughts about getting up and go in to the emergency room. It was the worst pain I have ever had and I could not move my arm. I could not sleep on the right side or on a left side and all I did was take Tylenol as prescribed and that helped a little bit but not much but I did not go to the emergency room, I am not going to do that but I felt like it because it hurts so bad but I made it through the night and next day it continued to hurt really bad. I just keep taking Tylenol every four hours and that continued for two days and then finally I was able to raise my arm up above my head without little pain, it was discomfort, but it was not hurting so bad.&#34; The patient stated that the event started about two hours later it started, it started hurting and then it continued to get worse and worse and it was severe, that is the reason why I am calling that it was severe. I wanted a shot or morphine to relieve myself that how bad it was.&#34; (no clarified further). The patient stated that the vaccine was given in my left arm only about one inch below the top of my shoulder which I think that might have been the problem, I don&#39;t know if you can answer that or not but I have never received the vaccine or shot anywhere near that area, it is always three or four inches down in my muscle, on my arm either on left or right, this was given in my left arm but this was given almost in my joint I am wondering if that would cause pain.&#34; The patient stated it was given only one inch below the tip above shoulder may be that is causing so much pain.&#34; The patient just wanted to report the severe pain, that was for two whole days and then it was subsided and it lasted for four days and I still have uncomfortable feeling in my arm. I was finally able to raise it above my head, my left arm, after two days but it was not comfortable to do it, it was painful.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Problem lasted for about a half hour. But a certain amount of weakness persisted and is still with me. Had one other wooziness episode on 1/24 at about the same time. This is new to me and may not be a reaction to the vaccination.

A 83-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 (age at vaccination: 83 years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient got the 1st vaccine dose &#34;today&#34; (23Jan2021)  but he had a fall and hit his head. Patient was now requiring TDAP. The clinical outcome of the event fell and his head was unknown. The reporting pharmacist was seeking information on the use with other vaccines, particularly the benefit vs risk of co-administering in an emergency case.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

An 84-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 (at the age of 84 years old) at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported he came home after getting his shot, and he felt a little unwell but it was no too bad (04Feb2021). Then, on 11Feb2021, he started having dysentery. On 12Feb2021, he got congestion in his chest and a real deep coughing, and then he started hurting at the base of his neck. The patient used a chest rub which helped break up some of the congestion, but he is still coughing. On unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient also experienced his head was hurting in the back of it, and his shoulders were hurting from his neck down his arms to his elbow; his shoulders had been hurting so bad, he thought they would come off. Now (Feb2021), when he gets up, his back is giving him trouble, and he can&#39;t stand up long because of the weakness. His body also seemed to want to walk backward on his heels when he stands up and he is wanting to fall (Feb2021). The patient has been taking his dog out every morning, but it is hard to do that now because he can&#39;t stand up that well (Feb2021). Therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the event congestion in his chest. Outcome of the event real deep coughing was not recovered while outcome of all the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 85-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included epilepsy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Caller says her father in law hasn&#39;t had seizure in years, it was diagnosed when he was a kid, 60-70 years ago).  There were no concomitant medications.  The reporter is calling on behalf of her father in law. She said he had his first dose of the COVID vaccine recently, she pulled this number off of the paperwork today. She says that she believes he had a side effect for it, and also he was rescheduled for his second dose. She says his second dose was supposed to be in 21 days but they rescheduled him for it at 18 days instead. She says he got the first dose on 11Jan, and they rescheduled his next for the 29th. She says she wanted to know if this was correct or ok. The reporter says that the following day he ended up having massive diarrhea, that it caused him while he was on the commode to pass out and he fell and hit his face, the best she can tell he was alone at the time. She says he did not go to the hospital for that, he got up and cleaned himself off and took a nap, and the nurse next door checked on him later on. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

                                                No adverse effects for the first two weeks.  The morning of 2/7/21 he claimed he was not able to sleep the night before.  He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                I experience muscle pain in my upper back muscles, both sides.  When I moved my head, I felp sharp stabbing pains which made me shout. I could not sleep much on March 8 evening. The pain persisted all day Tuesday March 9, 2021.  I called my ortho doctor and made a morning appointment for March 10, 2021 at 8:15am. I did not sleep much on evening of March 9. On Wednesday March 10 I went to the doctor. On this morning, the upper back muscles were OK, and the pain and spasms wer now in the neck. I could hardly move my head up or down and left and right. Dr. perscribed Methylprednazolone (4mg, 6-5-4-3-2-1 doses) and cyclobenzaprine 5mg (3x daily).  after 1 day and 1 dose, I feel I can movemy head a little farther without the stabbing pain.

An 85-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 09Feb2021 (Lot Number: EM9810) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2, at the age of 85-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 20Jan2021 (lot number: EL3302) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and experienced Vertigo, felt peculiar, nausea, dizziness/swimmy headed. The patient previously received the flu shot for immunization and experienced Sore arm. He is 85 and not familiar with all the goings on today but heard a report the other day and did not know there was such a thing as Vertigo. He thought that was just a movie. When he took the shot at (place name) in (county name) on 20Jan2021, soon thereafter, not that day but maybe next, he felt peculiar. It was just uneasiness and he did not feel right. That went on and on 09Feb2021, he got second shot and he got swimmy headed, but it has continued on since then and probably gotten worse, especially when he gets up in the morning. He has to hold on until he gets balanced or coordinated. It just doesn&#39;t seem right After he gets up and gets going, it is not as prevalent. But then sometimes it strikes him and he is just completely out of it. He later stated the peculiar feeling and swimmy headedness started the same day as the first injection, but he just did not really pay attention to it and thought it was just one of those things that you accept with getting older. Wife and he both went and he thought his feelings were merely from excitement or depletion or exhaustion. He felt like he had weakness and he just felt different. He got it at noon and waited for 15 minutes. Because of the events around him at the time, it did not register with him because it was the stress of driving 30 miles through expressway. Old people aren&#39;t used to driving that far. It got worse after the second shot and then he really knew something was wrong. When you are old, you have these feelings and pains and aches and all that stuff, and you just accept it as being old. It did not register with him until a couple of weeks ago when he heard it on TV about Vertigo and he said that is what he has. The swimmy headedness was really more noticeable after second shot, it brought it on stronger. He does not complain about things and thought it may just be getting old. He said it just kept on and getting a little worse and worse. Then he said something is not right and one day he bent over to look up and almost blacked out because of sensation in equilibrium or vision or whatever. He got scared and that was a couple of weeks ago. (name) was not cognizant of what was going on until he heard on television about Vertigo. One of the news channel mentioned or somebody mentioned it. It was just general things. He confirmed it was regarding someone who had gotten Vertigo after getting the vaccine but did not have a particular person to report on. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required. The outcome of the event dizziness aggravated and Weakness was not recovered, other events was unknown.

He had a little soreness in his arm on an unspecified date in Jan2021, but nothing out of the ordinary. He didn&#39;t know his arm was sore until he rubbed it. He though it might have been on Sunday when he noticed it. He was not sure. Prior to this, he had redness on the toe of his left foot on an unspecified date in Jan2021. He was prescribed an antibiotic that he was still taking. He was unable to provide the name of the antibiotic.

                                                My father was given his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Feb. 13, 2021.  He went downhill the following week.  He fell 9 times and was very confused.  He was taken to the hospital on Feb. 20 and admitted that day.  He spent a week there.  His condition continued to deteriorate.  He was totally bedridden for a week.  His mental status deteriorated.  By Feb. 22, he was unable to talk, he drooled, and had to be fed.  He made  slow improvement later in the week.  We were never given any reason for his condition.  There was no infection, no stroke, etc.  He was discharged and sent to rehab on Feb. 27.  He remained there until April 8.   He is currently doing fairly well.  He uses a walker and gait belt in the house and is receiving home therapy.  He is not as independent as he was before.  His short term memory seems to be more impaired than it was previously.

                                                The weeks following vaccination, the patient felt lethargic, dizzy, unstable on his feet. Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

                                                extremely lightheaded; like he was about to fall down; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. This physician reported similar events for 2 patients. This is the 1st of 2 reports.  An 89-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number; EL0140), intramuscular on the right arm on 30Dec2020 10:10 at single dose for vaccination.  Medical history included covid-19 on Jul2020 and had it fairly severe and almost died and he mentions he was overweight.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took flu shot (INFLUENZA VACCINE), a couple of months ago. He mentions he was in the military so he had a lots of shots in his life but he has never had a reaction like this.  The patient stated that on 30Dec2020 10:30, &#34;he became extremely lightheaded, like he was about to fall down. He sat down and is currently sitting down. This lightheadedness started about 20 minutes after the injection. When probed for the outcome, the caller explains it might be improving a little. The lightheadedness is not still not gone, but it has not worsened.  When probed for seriousness criteria, the caller explains he is just resting and sitting. He would say its not serious but it could be medically significant. He states he isn&#39;t sure if this is something that happens to just people who have had COVID before. He states none of his friends or relatives have this type of reaction. He lives in a retirement home and everybody is getting the injection. This is the second day of injections. He doesn&#39;t know if anybody had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine here&#34;. The outcome of the events were recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of lightheadedness and pre-syncope due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.   This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2020520862 same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient.
