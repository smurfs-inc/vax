                                                After receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine I was experiencing headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, and nausea. The first dose was on 12/21/20. These symptoms resolved around 12/26/20. I received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/11/21. I began experiencing symptoms on 01/12/21. The symptoms I was experiencing were lightheadedness, dizziness, and brain fog/confusion. These symptoms got significantly worse from 01/13/21 - 01/24/21 and I began developing profound confusion/brain fog, diplopia, blurry vision, headaches, feeling like I&#39;m swaying on a boat,  and the &#34;feeling of being drunk&#34;. As of 01/25/21, the symptoms have seemed to get better and I am starting to feel more like myself. The drunk feeling and mild blurry vision are still present as of today 01/28/21.

Before bed time, had cold sweats and shakes. 1/29 - woke up feeling perfectly fine.  2/17 - Second dose of vaccine. Arm felt sore and was sore two days after. From 2/18-2/20, I noticed the effects of the Cymbalta were gradually decreasing and was experiencing side effects (shocks from toe to head every step). Turns out that even with taking my regular dose of the Cymbalta, my body after 2 hours feels like I had never taken it.   2/20 - After experiencing heavy shocks, shaking, and heart racing, I went home after coming into work 3 hours later.  2/21 - Woke up today feeling dizzy, fatigued, and weak. I know that operating a motor vehicle will not be possible for me.

                                                I had a blood report taken on the 25th of February as a part of my physical. I have never had elevated platelets, but this report showed my platelets at at 499 (130-450 is reference ranges of the lab). A year ago, my platelets were just below the max at 445. Upon discussing with my PA, he didn&#39;t feel too concerned, but after asking if the first dose covid shot may have something to do with it, that became a potential etiology.  I am very unsure of my elevated platelets is associated with the first dose. Arm was stiff on injection date for approximately 6 hours. Felt slightly flu like symptoms (headache, dizziness, fatigue) that same evening of injection date and felt fine the next morning.  Blood specimen was taken on 25th of February 2021. Diet at the time is a ketogeneic diet. I&#39;d like to make it clear I mean no deception and am unsure if there is an association with the vaccine and platelet levels, but my elevated platelets is inconsistent with any other blood report in the past, and the dose 1 covid vaccine was the only &#34;new&#34; thing in my life prior to the blood draw. I figured, better to let y&#39;all know in case it became relevant. Currently on no treatments for the platelets and was told to &#34;not worry about it&#34; which is hard for me to just take.

He walked back to the waiting room and fell onto the bench. I went out to sit with him and held onto him as he passed out/lost consciousness for approximately 20 seconds. We gave him water and called 911. The paramedics arrived and checked his vitals. He was fine after that and stayed for about a half an hour before he left.

                                                On 2/13/2021, I began to experience both enhanced and new musculoskeletal and neurological symptoms that have not completely resolved still, today, 3/16/2021. While I had experienced some slight discomfort and pain of the b/l thumbs 2-3 weeks prior to 2/13, I began to experience increased pain up to the forearm in both arms on that day. In addition to pain, I had large muscular knots in the superior forearms, especially the right arm. The lower right arm felt extremely tight, and I was having difficulty raising the arm and gripping things. This continued for 2-3 weeks on the right arm. During that time, symptoms worsened on the left arm, while improving on the right arm. A week after the initial symptoms my left arm became worse, and I was struggling to lift objects as light as a sheet of paper. I was also having trouble typing at work, dialing the phone, and opening or closing my hand. Just over a week after symptoms began, I left work to determine a cause and solution for my issues. I also began to have tremors, extreme muscle spasms, and involuntary movements around this time for about 2-3 weeks. While the neurological symptoms have mostly subsided, still, today, 3/16/2021, I continue to deal with various inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms affecting mostly my left arm, but also my right arm. Since yesterday, my left shoulder has begun to have pain as well, making raising my arm and reaching to the opposite side difficult due to pain. I have also had persistent popping of various joints in both arms since the initial symptoms began.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving vaccination, patient started experiencing cold sweats and he felt like we was about to pass out. I took him into the clinic room and allowed him to lay down and began to fan him down for him to cool off. After 1-2 minutes, we put him on his back and elevated his feet. While he was laying down, I checked his blood pressure and it was low. I let him lay down for 5 more minutes and he started to feel much better and was cooled down. I slowly got him up and allowed him to sit and checked his blood pressure again. The blood pressure began to normalize. After 5 more minutes, I told him to get up and slowly walk to another chair in the room. Once he was rested there for about 5 minutes, I checked his blood pressure a 3rd time in the opposite arm and it was normal. He no longer felt the light headed feeling and was cooled off. The patient&#39;s partner then informed me that he has a fear of needles and the last time he received a vaccination about 7 years ago, the same reaction happened.

                                                Patient was sitting for his 15 minutes. At about 5 minutes after his vaccine he passed out and fell off his chair to the floor. The Pharmacy intern noticed that the color of his skin was like a purple and he was passed out. When she started to approach him he started slowly moving his head and adjusting his eyes. He said he felt really dizzy and we had him lay down. He was very sweaty and was shaking a little bit. I took his blood pressure at 11:53 and it was approximately 124/93. He was responsive but feeling dizzy and warm and I stayed with him until the paramedics arrived at about 11:54

                                                This RPH was called to assist patient at 11:27a. Patient stated he felt dizzy and I assisted patient to the floor. Once laying on floor I elevated patient&#39;s feet above his head. By stander reported that patient appeared to have blacked out right before I arrived on scene. Patient stayed upright in chair during blackout which only lasted a few seconds.  Patient stated he did eat breakfast but had not slept due to working overnight. Patient was assisted to sitting position on floor at 11:33a at which time he drank a bottle of water. After finishing bottle of water he stated he felt dizzy again and I assisted him back to a laying position on floor.  After 10 minutes I assisted patient back to a sitting position. After sitting for a few seconds patient stated he felt like he would get sick. Before I could return, patient vomitted on himself and over the floor. Patient continued to vomit/dry heave into trashcan for a few minutes. After patient was done getting sick, he drank another bottle of water. He sat for a few minutes prior to standing. At this time patient&#39;s mother-in-law had arrived at store to take patient home. Patient wanted to leave store immediately as he felt it was making him more uncomfortable due to current condition. Patient left store approximately 12p.

He then vomited again the next day and continued to not feel well the next couple of days. On 4/20/2021 at around 4:20pm he called his mother, his girlfriend and his mentor that he was not feeling well, was nauseous and dizzy and had shivers and was going to pull over on his car to get something to drink. He then stopped answering his phone and was found dead in his car later on that day. Police is investigating the case.

                                                Patient came up to counter about 5 minutes after receiving his vaccine and stated he was feeling light-headed and that his sight and hearing  was going. We had patient slowly sit down on the floor near the counter, a tech got him a cool rag for his neck while pharmacist stayed with him. he started to feel much better after the rag was on his neck for a few minutes and said his vision and hearing was normal again. Denied history of this happening after vaccination. Patient denied any difficulty breathing or swelling of throat/tongue. RPH check bp and it was 95/55, pulse 80. Patient stated he  was at clinic yesterday and was told his bp was on the lower end of normal. Reported feeling a bit nauseous also. We gave him a bag in case he got sick and a small bottle of water. He was able to stand up and walk to a chair to sit down. We asked if he wanted us to call someone and he declined and said he was feeling better. We asked him to stay for 30 minutes more so we could monitor. After 30 minutes he reported the nausea had passed and he  was feeling normal again. He said he was ok to drive home.

                                                About two or three days after my second Pfizer vaccination I started to feel some immense pain in my right trapezius. I had difficulty moving my neck for several hours. The pain subsided later that day but I still had adverse effects. I had a numbing and tingling feeling that traveled from my right trapezius all the way down to my fingers. That sensation continued for several weeks (3 or so) until I saw my general physician. She conducted some strength tests and noticed that there was some weakness and lack of coordination on my right side. I was instructed to go get and MRI and the results showed 5 lesions in my brain and 1 in my cervical spine (C2-C3). After many other tests including blood tests and a follow up MRI the neurologist that viewed my case informed me that I showed a strong case of demylination and it looked likely that Multiple Sclerosis.   The shot might have caused an immune response which allowed the MS to appear.

This client understood what was going on and while sitting in the vaccination chair, he slowly put his hands on the floor and put himself in the seated position. He then slowly laid down on the floor and put his legs up on his chair preparing for this syncopal episode. The EMT was alerted by this client&#39;s nurse that he felt dizzy and then notified the lead nurse, about the situation. The client was lying down on the floor for a couple minutes and at about 1448 was able to get up and sit himself back on the chair. Client felt stable enough to walk over to the observation area and sit down in the zero gravity chair for a few minutes. The client drank some water while sitting in the zero gravity chair and at about 1452 was no longer dizzy or light headed and went over to sit in one of the regular chairs in the observation area to wait out the rest of his 15 minute period. The client explained that syncopal episodes after vaccinations regularly happen to him and that this is not out of the ordinary. The client explained that he ate and drank before his vaccination, takes no medications, and has no medical history. At about 1500 the client was stable and was able to ambulate out of the facility and to his car and verbalized feeling capable of driving himself home since he was no longer feeling dizzy or lightheaded.

A 26-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot number was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right at the age of 26-year-old, on 12Apr2021 10:30, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive vaccine in four weeks nor was the patient tested for COVID post vaccination. On 12Apr2021 at 11:00, the patient felt dizzy and then the patient passed out. When the patient woke 3 minutes later, he had fallen and hit his head and injured his ankle. The patient was taken by the ambulance to the local ER and was released later that day as his vitals had returned to normal. Therapeutic measures taken in response to the events included IV fluids. They advised that the patient reach out to see if he can receive my second shot on 03May202. Outcome of the events was recovering at the time of the report.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Afterwards I couldn&#39;t sleep because of a racing heart rate when I returned home after about an hour. Heard rate stabilized and I was able to nap after another hour. I had a serious brain fog, vertigo, dizziness, wandering eyes (can&#39;t focus them, going cross-eyed a lot), memory loss (unsure if I completed a task or not), and faint hearing (this improved on day 2). I&#39;m currently on day 3 and I am trending upward but not 100% yet.

                                                Client received the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine (Lot #EW0167 Exp. 08/2021) at 10:58 AM. Client was in the presence of his sister when he requested to sit outside for fresh air during his 15 minute observation. EMT acknowledged his request and the client sat outside near the entrance while EMT stood near the entrance. Client was with his sister and mother and was checked on every 5 minutes by EMT to see how he was feeling. Client&#39;s family seemed unconcerned and the client stated that he had a fear of needles. However, after 10 minutes, client began to complain of feeling like &#34;fainting.&#34; Client was a 26 year old male alert and tracking and anxious. Client had a chief complaint of a low heart rate. This was the client&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and he denied any chronic illness or allergies. Clients blood pressure while sitting up was 88/38 and heart rate was 48 and regular at the radial. Client had no swelling, hives, discoloration, shortness of breath or other signs of anaphylaxis. Client&#39;s airway, breathing and circulation were intact and was alert and oriented to person, place, date and event. Client&#39;s remaining vitals were respirations 14, eyes 5mm and sluggish, O2 saturation 98%, lung sounds clear bilaterally and temperature 98 degrees f. EMTS brought an observation bed outside to allow the client to lay down and continued to taking vitals at 5 minute intervals. Client&#39;s blood pressure improved to 108/72 but heart rate continued to remain low and hovered at the high forties. At 1133 client consented to having EMTs call 911 due to his low heart rate. 911 was called at 1137 and arrived at 1142. Vitals were continuously monitored until firefighters arrived and were as follows: 1123 - 108/76, 52, 14, 02 98%, 1128 - 108/72, 52, 14, O2 97, 1133 - 108/68, 48, 14, O2 98%, 1138 - 108/68, 48, 14, O2 98%, 1138 - 108/72, 48, 14, O2 98%. Paramedics and the fire department assumed care at 11:42. Client was assessed by paramedics and firefighters while on site and it was at this time that client revealed he was under the influence of &#34;edibles.&#34; Client consented to EMS transport and departed  with Paramedic unit 6 and Fire Engine 7 at 1151. Client transported to Hospital. Registered nurse remained with the patient&#39;s mother and daughter to answer their questions and provide emotional support. VAERS completed, confirmation number        .

                                                1st Pfizer shot beginning of April went fine. Only a sore arm. 2nd shot this past Saturday was a different story. I got the shot around 3:30 and felt great until about 7. My arm started getting very sore. It got better a little later in the day.  Next morning I felt pretty fatigued but nothing I haven?t felt before. Sore arm was still there. Pretty manageable. Had to pick up groceries and that was a mistake. Had to take deep breaths and my knees were in a lot of pain as I got out of the car and walked through the store (I injured them years ago and now have Baker&#39;s cysts). Wife brought me home and I had rigors on the ride back.  I got home around 11:45 or so and I put on a blanket. I felt so hot I started to get a little bit delusional and very sad/started getting teary. Took off blanket and couldn?t get off the couch or walk without help. Knees now felt like about to fall apart. Wife takes temp shows 107, makes ice bath, I get in and it goes down to 105 a few minutes later. Temp went down to 103 over the next 15-20 minutes and stayed there. Got out with her help and still couldn?t stand up or walk without help.  Sat upright in bed rest of the day. Fever ranged from 98-103, mostly 101-103. Took a very cold shower later in the day but temp still stayed in the same range. All other symptoms mentions else stayed the same. I also now had no appetite and felt nauseous. Stomach felt rock hard, and I didn?t feel too with it. Finally fell asleep later at night and woke up feeling way better but still awful. Monday and Tuesday I had to take off work I felt so fatigued. Both of those days I had no fever, it went away from Sunday night into Monday. I can walk by myself now and just feel a little fatigued today. I have my appetite back now and am back to work.  I should mention that I took Tylenol which didn?t help. Ibuprofen I took later in the day and that might have helped a little. Took Benadryl later and that helped with sleep.

Nothing I did helped or stopped it, I kept biting my tongue and could not walk, my entire body was shaking very very aggressively, I stayed laid down and focused on relaxing my body, eventually it calmed down on its own and I quickly tried to fall asleep before it came back, I feel fine today, just really shaken up and frightened. I did not call anyone and have not seen any doctor about it. I thought I was having a seizure, except was conscious.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s parent). A 26-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (reported as &#34;this afternoon&#34;) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at 26-year-old) as first dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as no. Concomitant medications were not reported. Couple minutes into that he got light headed, his vision got blurred and then he had a complete vision loss. They cleared the room and called the paramedics. The paramedics came and said that both of his eyes were dilated and his blood pressure was high. They sat him for couple of minutes, then his vision return. So if they ask them make the total of vision loss lasted for seven minutes. His blood pressure went down. They kept him there and had a given a bottle of water and two container of fruit juice to bring his sugar level up. They made sure everything seems alright. And paramedics left and said that they thought it would be cause from some sort of blood reaction and allergic reaction to vaccine. And told them not to get the second shot. And let us want to he felt ok that it would be alright to go home. They did keep him there for about half an hour longer just to make sure he was alright and then sent him home. That was just a reaction and he should be ok now. No treatment received. The outcome of the events was resolved on an unspecified date. Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

However, I have been noticing that ever since I completed the 2 dose series I have been feeling dizzy randomly. First I thought it was normal but now is been months and I constantly feel dizzy. I check my blood pressure and heart rate thinking it may be due to that but they?re usually within normal ranges and the dizziness episodes just come and go throughout the day.

I still see a few bumps, but it seems to be healing. I didn&#39;t do anything differently in my daily routine; nothing changed (ie: same soap, same detergent, no contact with dust or etcetera). The tattoo also contains phosphorus, which might be related to the reaction.  The muscle aches and cramps are still ongoing; which is weird considering how I never get either and my daily activities haven&#39;t changed.

                                                I began to experience rapid heart rates to the 140s intermittently starting on the Wednesday following my first vaccination.  I also had associated neck pain and &#34;pounding sensation&#34; in my neck, chest, and arms. I had difficulty lying flat at night and developed a dry cough. I went to the urgent care on 4/19/21 and was diagnosed with torticollis. No one at the urgent care listened to my heart or lungs. Given that my symptoms had been diagnosed, I delayed seeking further treatment. My symptoms continued to worsen. I had difficulty walking long distances, exercising. I became short of breath easily. I ended up going to my primary care doctor on 4/26/21 for a second evaluation. He was concerned and did an EKG, it only showed sinus tachycardia. He scheduled me for an echocardiogram and put me on a beta blocker (Bystolic) 5 mg once daily. The echo showed EF 47% with global hypokinesis of the L ventricle. Doctor called me into the office as soon as he saw the results, concerned for myocarditis or pericarditis.

He had blurred vision and mild shaking and kept asking what is going on.  He was asked to lay down on the floor but chose to remain sitting on the floor.  He was given a cold compress for his neck and stayed seated on the floor until he felt better.  He stated that he was not dizzy, lightheaded but felt really tired.  He recovered and stayed for about 15 minutes after recovering.  He declined any medical attention and had a ride with his companion.  He was advised to seek medical attention at the ER.

He stood up to say something to a cashier and while the pharmacist was walking out to check on him, his vision started to blur and he fell. He hit the plexiglass around our counter and then ended up sitting on the floor. He did not hit his head on the floor, and he was conscious and trying to get up when I reached him. We moved him into our immunization room, and had him lay down. Within about 5 minutes, he started to feel much better and was able to sit up and eat some crackers and drink some juice. He is getting a ride home and will relax for the rest of the evening.

Took 50mg of benadryl shortly after and symptoms improved over the following hour.

                                                A few hours after my second dose on 1/08/2021, I had some adverse reactions that worried me, including arm numbness, tingling around my mouth and cheeks, a splitting headache/blurry vision, joint and muscle pain and dizziness. I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

Within less than 3 minutes the patient informed a student  that he did not feel well. He reported: itching, feeling hot, shortness of breath, dizziness, loss of vision, and thirst. The student alerted me and I assessed the pt. He was responsive, but felt &#34;tired&#34;. He was sitting on the floor. I told the student to call 911. I continued talking with the pt. as I was preparing the epinephrine and placing a blood pressure cuff on his arm. He became less responsive and asked me for the epinephrine. I injected him with an EpiPen 0.3mg in his outer left thigh through his pants (at 11:43am). Within approximately 30s-1min the pt. became more responsive. I then took his pulse and BP shortly before EMS arrived (11:52am) . They performed the second blood pressure reading and the pt. was transferred to their care at that point.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

                                                27 year old male received his second shot today and immediately after the shot felt nausea lightheaded and dizzy. He says it feels like the room is spinning around him. He does not have any PMH nor does he state that he takes any medication. He denies any street or illegal drug use. Pt states that he had a couple drinks last night and did not eat anything today. After providing water and laying him down for 30 min he was still symptomatic so it was decided that the patient should be seen in the ED for further workup. Patient is in agreement and he will be sent.   148/101, P 92, O2% 99% 150/101, P 90  ED Note: Physical exam reveals an alert, normocephalic male he has a normal heart rate with normal heart sounds, normal pulmonary effort, lung sounds are clear abdomen is soft he does have some tenderness in the epigastric area no rigidity or distention is noted.  Patient is neurologically intact he is alert and oriented x3, able to ambulate unassisted with a normal gait, sensation is intact, strength is 5 out of 5 in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally, no pronator drift, cerebellar function intact with finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin test.  Posterior oropharyngeal area shows uvula is midline there is no swelling airway is patent.   This is an atypical presentation if the patient is actually having an reaction to the vaccination however I am also concerned for possible abdominal issue we will work him up for ACS as well.  We will give patient a dose of Benadryl to see if that helps with some of his symptoms Bentyl for the stomach cramping and spasming and some fluids.   Lab work was unremarkable patient had a negative troponin&#39;s EKG was negative for STEMI, ischemic changes T wave abnormalities, lactate was normal, lipase was normal.  Patient still complaining of abdominal spasms but states he is feeling better than when he first arrived and would like to go home.  Patient states that his abdominal spasms have happened intermittently over the last few years he has had multiple imaging of his stomach and that he feels comfortable being discharged with the intention that if anything worsens he would return here to the emergency department.

                                                Patient received immunization and felt fine after sitting in chair for a few seconds. Pt got up and went to waiting area and  was sitting down in chair during the 15 minute observation window. Pt passed out and slumped/fell out of chair on patients left side. I was called out by the person monitoring the waiting area to see pt in fetal position on their left side seizing. The seizing lasted for about 15 seconds and then stopped. PT was motionless for a few more seconds and then came around and said &#34;I&#39;m back&#34;.  The pt was given a bottle of water because he said he was thirsty. In the meantime the paramedics were called and arrived. They checked his BP and Blood Glucose. After several minutes they took the pt out on a gurney for further evaluation, there was a question as to whether or not pt hit his head.

                                                I had intense stomach pains, muscle pains for 4 days. Could not get out of bed. Also had a fever. I thought these were regular side effects and eventually got better.   Then, about a week later I started getting nose bleeds with blood clots coming out of my nose.  These lasted a few more days. This never happened to me before, and must have been a side effect from the vaccine.

Patient hit chin and did lacerate it; this was attended to by NP who was administering shots at the time. Patient mentioned that he &#34;tasted like he threw up,&#34; was instructed to drink water. NP took vitals and patient showed no sign of concussion. In the mean time patient was trying to get ahold of a friend or family member to come pick him up. Still felt lightheaded 15 minutes after being attended to, at this time we called the squad. Before the squad could show up patients brother came to pick him up... was whisked away too quickly for us to stop him. Patient was adamant about us not calling squad because he does not have insurance.

Patient was tended to by the NP on duty, instructed to lie down and drink water while she tended to his cut. Patient mentioned it &#34;tasted like he threw up&#34; and still felt lightheaded after 15 minutes after the event. Patient was insistent that we should not call the squad as he does not have insurance. Patient in the meantime was trying to get ahold of a friend or family member to pick him up as we advised him that he could not leave in this state. We elected to call the squad as he had not recovered yet. Before the squad could come, the patients brother showed up and quickly whisked him away. Squad did show up but there was nothing to attend to so left without intervention.

                                                Pain developed in shoulder approximately 3-4 hours post vaccination. Progressed to complete inability to move shoulder, extreme pain upon any movement at all. Pain described as severe stabbing, burning pain centered in shoulder joint and deltoid muscle, causing complete incapacitation of left arm.  At scheduled Doctor&#39;s visit 5 hours later,  Advil was recommended. Patient decided to take Tylenol instead to avoid contraindication due to possible immune-reducing effects of Advil during vaccine immune-development time period.  29 hours after vaccine administration, 1000mg of Tylenol brought slight relief; at 35 hours 1000mg Tylenol taken again with similar effect, allowing more comfortable sleep, but shoulder had to remain immobilized to avoid severe pain.   At the time of this report, 55 hours have elapsed since administration of vaccine. Range of motion has increased to approximately 3 inches, after which strong pain and tightness occurs. Left arm still largely incapacitated beyond very slight motions like holding light object. Gentle motions of readjustment to sitting and typing on computer still cause pain past limit of range of motion. Shoulder/arm cannot be raised to any meaningful height without pain. Patient tends to bring arm close to body to avoid pain, effectively resulting in frozen shoulder.  PLEASE NOTE: Vaccine site was observed to be much higher up on shoulder than dose #1. Patient is concerned vaccine may have been administered into an area that may have caused entry of vaccine into shoulder joint space or bursa, at least 2 inches higher than suggested central deltoid muscle injection site.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 16Apr2021 at 14:30 as SINGLE DOSE (at the age of 27 years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included coarctation of the aorta from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing coarctation of aorta (age: 3 months), only requires bi-annual cardiologist visits, loss of consciousness from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, covid-19 from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any concomitant medications. The patient had no know allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. The patient lost his vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and light-headed on 16Apr2021 at 14:30. Circulation issues leading to a black out. Within 60 seconds of getting the shot, he began to feel light-headed. Within 30 seconds of that, he knew he needed help, so alerted the emergency medical technicians (EMTs) via car horn/flashers. By the time they arrived (120 seconds from the initial shot), he lost his vision and hearing and was essentially unresponsive. They woke him enough to unlock my car door, at which point they had him lay back to improve his circulation. That ultimately worked and got him back to normal within about 5 minutes. The patient had issues like this before relating to a coarctation of his aorta which he had done at 3 months of age. Over the years, he has &#34;blacked out&#34; like this from weight lifting and other high exertion things. This was the first time it was induced without him overexerting himself, and the onset of the &#34;blackout&#34; was much quicker than what he had experienced from weightlifting. Normally, he could tell 1-3 minutes in advance that he would black out. This time, it was about 30 seconds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lost vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and feel light-headed. EMTs did an electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood glucose check. The outcome of lost his vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and light-headed was recovered on an unknown date. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

A 27-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EW0164), intramuscular in the left arm on 15Apr2021 (at the age of 27-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On 15Apr2021, immediately after the vaccine, the patient experienced syncope due to which he fell. He fell from standing and hit his head on a table. There were no signs of soft tissue injury. The patient was brought into the emergency department from the vaccination room. The patient was not treated for the events. The clinical outcome of syncope, fell from standing and hit head on table was resolved on Apr2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of  BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot  be excluded based on temporal association.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.

On the 3rd-5th days after the shot, had a few brief periods of dizziness and high anxiety, lasting less than a minute or so each. Symptoms improved pretty quickly from there, and by about day 7 or so the chest pain was gone and felt completely back to normal. No significant fatigue, fever, or problems breathing at any point. Have not had any symptoms at all since.

                                                Around 2 weeks after my first dose, I started having heart palpitations. The palpitations were on and off for a week and I didn&#39;t think of it much. A week after the palpitations started it started happening more frequently and I was feeling light headed and I went to ER. I was diagnosed with SVT and put on metoprolol to control my heart rate. 1 week after I was on metoprolol, I took my second dose. I was feeling a little dizzy after my second dose but it improved after like 10 minutes. I started getting very fatigued and difficult to concentrate after my second dose. I  spoke to my doctor and we thought it was because of metoprolol. My cardiologist took me off metoprolol but the fatigue didn&#39;t stop and I started having aches in shoulders, arms, neck and back. The aches and fatigue was more severe in the morning. After a week of being off metoprolol I started waking up with chest pain. One day the pain was severe and I had aches in shoulders, arms, neck and back and my heart rate was around 140 so I went to ER. The doctors put me on carvedilol and my heart rate has been controlled but my body aches and fatigue has been going on. The cardiologist and my PCP aren&#39;t sure if SVT or the medication is causing my body aches and fatigue. The only other thing I could think of was the vaccine so I wanted to send this report.

                                                Symptoms of 2nd Covid vaccine lot EL 1284: numbness in feet, legs throbbing, muscle weakness in legs, overall tiredness  I received my second Pfizer vaccine on 1/12/21 at 12:15 pm.  After several hours, I felt weak and tired.  By 7:00 pm, I had a migraine that wouldn?t go away and I had muscle ache in my feet and legs.  On 1/13/21 I felt some numbness in my feet and my legs were throbbing.  By 10:00 pm, both of my feet were completely numb and my legs were throbbing/radiating heat.  It felt as if circulation was cut off from my feet entirely.  On 1/14/21 I went into work where I?m constantly on my feet.  I felt intense muscle weakness in my legs and thighs to point where I could barely stand up.  I immediately went to an urgent care where they started me on an Sodium Chloride 0.9% intravenous IV solution drip.  They ran blood tests and urine tests to rule out any other causes to my symptoms.  All results came back negative.  I was told to rest, hydrate, and recover for the next several days.  If my symptoms did not subside within the next couple days, I was instructed to go to the ER for further examination.

                                                Immediately after I administered the vaccine, the patient passed out. He fell onto the floor and  we witnessed some oral seizure like type movement . The patient was unconscious for approximately  1.5-2 minutes.  Our Chief Medical Officer was on site and walking into the room as the patient fell. We immediately placed him on his left side, protected his head, and stayed with him.  We called 911 immediately due to the uncertainty of health issues. Once conscious, the patient explained to us that he experiences such every time he receives a vaccine. He was assessed by the CMO as well as the EMTs that arrived on scene.  His vitals were taken. He was moved into a comfortable position and monitored.  He was alert and orientated x 3.  We requested he have someone pick him up instead of him driving himself home which he did.  This gentleman is also an employee and we were able to see him and verify all was well in the following days. We also recommended he tell all vaccinators that he experiences  LOC post vaccination. When he receives his second dose  we plan to have him lying down and our CMO will be present.  We recommended he follow-up with his PCP.

                                                After about an hour following my second COVID-19 Injection I began feeling warm.  My forehead felt warmer so I figure I may have had a slight fever at that point.  I received a metallic (Note I say metallic but I know it wasn&#39;t actually metal but that&#39;s simply the best way I can describe the taste I experienced) following the injection about 5 minutes after.  My arm remained sore following and still remains sore as of this report.  I experienced a decline in mental acuity following about an hour after injection.  I began to feel lightheaded and exhausted to the point I was experiencing severe disorientation and confusion.  I was having trouble putting sentences together and experienced a ringing sensation in the ears.  I felt like I wasn&#39;t even present anymore.  I couldn&#39;t comprehend things around me and apparently had conversations I don&#39;t even remember having.  Note that at that point I had gotten home but don&#39;t even remember getting home.  I just know that this did not begin to wear off until around 8:45pm  when it was like someone flipped a switch and I suddenly was coherent again.  It was an odd sensation to experience.  The arm remained sore and the metallic taste returned briefly after this experience.  I experienced a similar feeling from the HPV injection years ago, but just like this it was a temporary thing that resulted in no long term issues.  However, I cannot tell you fully what we did the rest of the day until around 845-9 pm.  I also remember becoming partly agitated after the injection like my body just all of a sudden took notice of something and shot into action.  I had received my allergy injections this same day about two hours earlier as well and none of these reactions ever occur with those for me.  I continued to drink liquid as far as I know as there were a few empty bottles of water next to me.  I have no recollection of getting them.  It&#39;s odd.  There&#39;s just this brief moment in time that is just missing from my memory with a few short bits and pieces that are there like a puzzle with some missing pieces.  I feel I became so fatigued I could not function.  My emotions I remember were off and hard to control during this period too.  I felt like I was having some random mood swings.  I feel ok now though aside from the upset stomach occasionally and the fatigue and arm pain (but even the arm pain has partly decreased now).  It all ceased.  I have a number of health issues outside of this but have not experienced this long of a period of almost intermittent amnesia and incoherency following an injection before.  I believe it made me that much more tired or reacted with one of my many conditions or genetic variants that perhaps may have been part of this.  I&#39;m happy to provide anything I can to help with this.  I am greatly appreciative of all the CDC has done to get us this vaccine and continues to do to ensure our safety both before and after injection.  It is commendable.    I did fill out my survey through the V-Safe portal as well and will continue to follow up there should I have any changes.  I have not sought medical care following this event as the coherency and such have seemed to resolve in regards to the vaccine injection.  Only thing left are known side effects at this point besides an occasional increase in numbness and tingling that I already experience in my legs and feet.  My absolute best guess for the cause is my immune system which already has some issues regulating (doesn&#39;t always like to learn everything it should and we are currently searching for an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder currently going on as well in me) on top of allergy shots today.  it was perhaps just a bit too much demand on it all at once.  But it seems to be balancing out again now.

He notes blurry vision after this occurred but felt like he was slowly improving. While he was being brought to the ED in a wheelchair he began experiencing blurry vision again and his face became very pale. He was given some apple juice and reports that after 5-10 minutes he felt back to normal. While his vitals were being taken, his HR and BP were very low and he experienced another episode. Pt does not have a hx of passing out 2/2 needles and notes that he gets a flu shot every year and is totally fine. He does note that he became queasy when he tried to give blood in the past but that this does not normally happen. Of note, pt denies any leg swelling prior to these episodes. Pt endorses a low baseline HR in the 50s per his Fitbit but otherwise denies any known heart problems.

                                                Patient has a history of syncope after vaccinations (last occurred with a vaccination 10 years ago) but did not state this prior to  receiving his first COVID-19 vaccine. About 1 minute after sitting down in the observation area, he fell to the ground and briefly lost consciousness. Multiple staff members came immediately to assess, rolled him over, and he immediately came to and was alert and oriented. He was taken to a medical area and laid down on a cot. He had unremarkable vitals and was breathing normally. He initially endorsed feeling lightheaded, but denied any other symptoms. He was given crackers and water given that he had not had much to eat or drink before the vaccination. He had a normal neurological exam. He was noted to have a superficial abrasion above and below the left eye (lower forehead and upper cheek), and a small Bandaid was  placed on the forehead. Fire rescue on site called EMS, who assessed him. There were no immediate concerns and he refused transportation to a hospital for further assessment.  After 1 hour had passed, the patient confirmed that he was feeling normal and he was allowed to leave. He was able to walk out of the facility of his own volition and did not have further symptoms when standing. His wife verified that she would drive him home. Prior to leaving, he was given strict instructions of reasons to seek immediate medical care should he have any new or worsening symptoms. The patient indicated understanding. Communication was performed via a Language Line medical interpreter.

Upon review of his lab results yesterday, I called the hematology fellow, Dr. through program at hospital and he recommended the labs to be obtained and rechecking labs in one week. He felt the student was not exhibiting any emergent symptoms requiring emergent evaluation. Patient and I spoke on phone after this call with fell at 1557 4/6 and I advised him to seek emergent medical eval in ED for any CP, SOB, HA or any neurologic symptoms. Patient has not had any of those symptoms. He exercised this morning without difficulty.   He notes raised papules on legs which he has had in past. They have currently been present for a few days. He believes it to be related to biking in sweatpants. He has been in a hot tub recently, but after the bumps were present. They do not itch.

A 28-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer COVID Vaccine, solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8733; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 28Mar2021 at 17:00 (at the age of 28 years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

                                                Received  the vaccine at 10:;15 am on 4/14/2021 and had fatigue, slight chills, and a sore arm.  By 4/16/2021 I felt normal until approx. 10pm when my right ear blocked up and I lost hearing in my right ear.  On 4/17/2021 I treated it as a congestion issue with neti pot and decongestions but the ear remained blocked.  After sleeping for approx 1 hour on 4/17/2021 I woke up at approx. 11pm with severe vertigo and nausea and vomited consistently for approx 1 hour.  I could not get off of the floor and the right side of my face was fixated to the floor.  Paramedics were called and I was taken to the ER where I was treated with anti-nausea medications and valium to reduce vertigo.  A non contrast CT, blood panel, and stroke assessment were all normal with no sign of ear infection.  I was release from the hospital at 10am on 4/19/2021.    On 4/21/2021 I saw an ENT who performed a hearing exam revealing my right ear is completely deaf with normal left ear function.  The ENT prescribed prednisone 10mg (63 tablets over 10 days).   As of today (4/25/2021) I no longer have vertigo and nausea, but I still have no hearing in my right ear and have significant vestibular challenges and cannot walk safely unassisted without getting dizzy.

He cut his face.-Severe, Systemic: Seizure-Medium, Systemic: Shakiness-Medium, Additional Details: Pt told me he gets lightheaded after vaccines. I told him I&#39;d help him get to a chair near vaccination area so I could monitor him. He agreed. I didn&#39;t even have time to apply the bandage when he started twiching &amp; basically jumped out of his chair. He twisted 180 degrees and fell on his face. He got cut in at least 2 facial areas. Pharmacist cleaned him up. He never lost consciousness. EMS came and treated him. He refused to go to hospital at first, but eventually they took him.

He asked if he could go buy a drink and we requested he sit in lobby first. After about 5 minute patient stated he felt dizzy. He was asked to remain seated and yell at staff if he needed help. Pharmacy staff visually monitored him and he spoke up saying he felt faint and dizzy. Pharmacist stood in front of him in his seat incase he fainted so he wouldn&#39;t fall down. Store manager called 911. Paramedics arrived about 5 minutes later and took over assessing patient. Patient never lost consciousness or needed CPR. Paramedics took his blood pressure and monitored him for a little while and patient went home.

Today would be day 9 since I have had the first dose. I have been experiencing a brain fog and strange head pressure (not painful, just somewhat uncomfortable), as well as slight dizziness and hard to focus. I previously had Covid on 12/21/2020. It seems to come and go throughout the day. Some days are more foggy than others.

                                                Aside from the expected soreness in the arm and short lived fevers, I started to develop painful swelling and hard lumps in my lymph of the same armpit as my injection site. It was quite painful and broke out into a puss-tipped rash and continued to get worse. It has been over 20 days now and instead of getting better, it has spread to my other armpit now. I went to the local advanced urgent care clinic who ran some bloodwork and said my white cell count is normal and non-indicative of lymphoma, so I was put on prednisone and doxycycline. The medication has done next to nothing and I was told that there was nothing else they could do. The pain in the arm varies per day but there are some days where it is too painful to use my arms at all.

                                                Immediately after the patient received the vaccination he stated that his arm felt numb. This seemed to concern him greatly although I reassured him that this reaction had been reported to me on other occasions and it was transient. I checked his blood pressure and pulse, both of which were normal, and he waited for about 20 minutes before returning to work where he received the shot. He returned to the pharmacy approximately 15 minutes later and stated that he felt dizzy, nauseous, and had blurry vision. His forehead felt cold and clammy to the touch and he was sweating. I had him sit, and checked his pulse again (still normal). He stated that his chest felt &#34;cold and tired&#34; but he was not having difficulty breathing. After observing him for some minutes I gave him a 50mg dose of Benadryl in case the reaction was allergic in nature. I observed him for at least 15 more minutes were he seemed calm and was able to speak on his cellphone to family so they could come and pick him up. In my opinion he seemed improved by the time he left but I counseled him to seek medical attention if his adverse feeling worsened. The patient was able to walk out of the Walmart without assistance. I called him at home around 5:20 pm and he sounded very sleepy but he had not yet had to seek further medical attention.

                                                Cognitive -- severe symptoms began ~3 days after Pfizer 2nd dose.  Extreme disorientation and confusion (transient), memory loss (longterm), extreme lethargy - unable to move, intermittant psychosis (mild, esp. when going to sleep), and anxiety (transient but very extreme, unlike anything I&#39;ve felt before, not improved by diazepam)  (continued for 10 days then began to improve dramatically followed by alternating relapse on a daily basis for 4 weeks, up to present -- dramatically and stably improved by steroid treatment, returned after discontinuing)   Nerve pain --  began ~1 week after Pfizer second dose. -- tingling, burning throughout extremities, especially fingertips, toes, hips; transient (usually 5 seconds or less). Progressively became more frequent (20&#43; / day), longer lasting (up to 20 seconds) and more severe (like stabbing or electric shock). Gradually resolved after course of dexamethasone beginning 3 weeks after vaccination.   Sharp inner ear pain -- (both ears) began ~1 week after Pfizer second dose. Rare events (~5x / day), very transient (1-2 seconds) but extremely painful. Continues up to present,  (4 weeks after Pfizer second dose). Also constant popping of both ears beginning week 2 to present, feels like fluid inside.   Adenopathy -- On 4/28/21 noticed massive swelling on left pectoral muscle (contralateral to vaccine injection site), diagnosed as lymphadenopathy, moderately painful. Continued to get worse for 1 week, began dexamethasone on 5/7/21. Dramatically improved, however swelling returned after discontinuing steroid and spread to all lymph nodes, including neck and others. Became extremely painful on 5/14/21, unable to walk due to swelling in inguinal lymph nodes.  Again dramatically improved after steroid injection on 5/16/21.

All of a sudden everything went white and my head got light headed and I had to go down on my knees, I was then weak and advised to stay seated. Eventually it passed but I am shaken up.

After the shot I took him to the waiting area to wait for 15 minutes.  After about 3 minutes, he lost consciousness and fell off of his chair.  After about a minute he came to and slowly got to his knees and came to and was able to sit back down in the chair.

                                                28 year old male presented for initial dose of Phizer-BioNtech at 1100 AM on 6/3/21.  Pre-assessment form was filled out and reviewed with nursing student administering the vaccine. The client stated no known allergies to medications, food, venom, or environmental elements. He also stated no allergic reactions to previous vaccines. The client also stated that he had no known health issues. After administration the patient stated he was dizzy and then immediately became unresponsive, diaphoretic, eyes rolled back, and head hyperextended. Family was present and we asked if he had any seizure history and his family declined. At this time the patient and family informed us that after vaccines in the past he does faint but didn&#39;t inform staff before this vaccine was administered. The patient remained unresponsive for 45 seconds. Then his feet were elevated and he asked to lay down. At 11:11 AM his HR was 60 and O2 was 97% on pulse oximetry. He felt hot and was still diaphoretic and felt very fatigued. Once he started feeling better we sat him back up and his HR was 89 and O2 was 99%. We gave him  2 bottles of water and crackers. He remained in our care for 45 minutes. He then waited an additional 30 minutes in the post vaccine area. His family stated they were going to drive him home and get some food.  The patient is expected to return June 24, 2021 for his second dose of the Phizer vaccine. We provided additional discharge instructions

Patient was informed of possible side effect he might experience from the vaccine. After, being informed of possible side effects, the patient was asked how he felt; the patient stated &#34;okay&#34;. The patient walked from the vaccination room to a chair in the waiting area and sat down. After a couple minutes the patient was asked again how he felt. He stated &#34;Okay&#34;. After approximately 10 minutes after administration of vaccine the patient moved from the chair he had been sitting in to one closer to the pharmacy. The patient was asked again how he felt; the patient stated, &#34;I&#39;m starting to feel funny.&#34; Patient was asked if he wanted water. He stated, &#34;Yes&#34;. A second pharmacist was asked for assistance when the first was getting water. The patient was given an ice pack along with the water. The ice pack was placed on the back of the patient?s neck while he was sitting in the chair. The second pharmacist grabbed a blood pressure cuff to check the patient&#39;s blood pressure. The patient stated, ?I feel like I?m going to pass out.? While the second pharmacist checked the patient?s blood pressure, the first pharmacist went to get the Nurse Practitioner from the Convenient Care within the store for assistance with the patient. While the first pharmacist was getting the nurse practitioner, the patient passed out and was not responding to the second pharmacist. The third pharmacist on staff immediately called 911 for assistance. The nurse practitioner and first pharmacist arrived back to the patient. The nurse practitioner rubbed the patient?s sternum and checked for his blood pressure and pulse. The patient?s legs were raised and placed on a second chair. The patient regained consciousness. The patient was very pale and sweating. He was alert and could answer questions. After a few minutes emergency services arrived. They talked with the patient for roughly 10-15 minutes. After that the paramedics left and had the patient remain for a few more minutes. The patient?s wife was with him and they left the store at 1:59pm.

                                                dizziness; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable healthcare professional. A 28-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration and unspecified anatomical site on 17Mar2021 (at the age of 28-years-old), as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included back surgery in Dec2020 (four months ago, from the time of reporting) and since that time the patient had episodes of dizziness, unknown if it is ongoing. In Dec2020, two days after back surgery, he had a syncopal episode and hit his head. The patient was evaluated at hospital emergency department and he reported negative computerised tomogram (CT) of head from the visit and was diagnosed with concussion. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration and unspecified anatomical site on an unspecified date, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, and patient did not experience any event with the first dose of COVID vaccination. On 17Mar2021, during his fifteen minutes waiting period after the second dose of vaccination, the patient began to experience dizziness. The patient denied any other symptoms. The patient received water as a therapeutic measure. The follow up response to treatment was excellent. The patient was stable to go home and advised to follow up with primary care physician (PCP). The clinical outcome of the event dizziness was unknown at the time of report.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.  Amendment: This follow-up report is being submitted to amend previously reported information: Patient age added, the first dose of BNT162B2 previous was captured as Past Drug Event and updated as Historical Vaccine, CT of head added as lab data instead of medical history, removed duplicate indication of COVID-19 immunisation, Vaccination Facility Country added, narrative updated accordingly. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case.

I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

                                                After leaving the vaccination clinic following the 15 minute waiting period, I felt normal and ran a quick errand before returning to work. After completing the errand (roughly 15 minutes), I began driving back to my office (roughly 10 minute drive). As I was roughly 1/2 mile from the office, I started to feel slightly lightheaded/woozy. I continued to drive toward the office, and within a matter of a couple minutes or less, I was overcome with extreme disorientation and faintness. Before I could manage to return to the office or pull over to collect myself, I completely lost consciousness and crashed into another vehicle. Even after the crash, I was unconscious for roughly a minute or so until I finally came to and realized what had happened. It then took me another couple of minutes to collect myself and exit the vehicle to assess the situation and ensure all parties were alright. Police/Emergency services were contacted and a police report was filed. After the event, I remained slightly nauseated for approximately 3 hours and had intermittent chill episodes, but the adverse events have since subsided.

                                                I felt soreness and pressure build up in my arm starting a few hours after the receiving the dose. The soreness and pressure got progressively worse over the course of two days. It wasn&#39;t unbearable, just uncomfortable. The second day after the vaccine I had stretched my arm pretty good for minute, when I released the stretch I felt a rush of something for from my arm into my torso. I got really dizzy and passed out, my wife was in the room at the time and said I never closed my eyes; but I had completely blacked out. My wife had woken me up and I wasn&#39;t sure what had happened, it took me about 30 seconds to realize I had passed out after stretching that arm. My arm had felt better after waking up from passing out, and soreness had passed a couple days later. I didn&#39;t get checked out,  after I woke up I started feeling fine.  I&#39;m honestly not sure if it&#39;s directly related to the vaccine or not, I just thought I should let someone know just in case.

Pharmacy staff put his legs up and gave him water, he continued to be a little disoriented and when he tried to get up , started to look like he would pass out again so we kept him down.

EMS took over when they arrived and they decided he needed to be transported to ER.

He laid his head on his girlfriend&#39;s shoulder and fainted.  He was alert and conscious within 2 minutes.  At that time, the patient said he does suffer from vasovagal syncope and frequently passes out when his anxiety is high.  He denied our attempts to call for 911.  After 30 minutes, the patient left under his own strength.  His girlfriend drove them both home.

                                                After a few hours of receiving the vaccine, I could start to feel soreness in my left armpit (lymphnode). This moved to all of left arm even all left side of body. Began feeling very tired. Less than 12 hrs after receiving 2nd dose I had to leave work early. 3:30 am the next morning I had uncontrollable shivers/tremors. To the point where I couldn&#39;t stand on my own. I had a fever of 101 degrees. As a result of the tremors I had entire body soreness. Hot flashes; alternating from sweat to freezing. Side effects began to dissipate after a full 24 hours.

He lost all color to his face. Blood pressure was taken and it was 92/60. We gave him a cold pack on the back of his neck and had him lay down and elevate his feet  and legs. Also got him some cold water to drink. He started to feel better in about 15 minutes after that. We continued to monitor blood pressure about every 5 to 10 minutes and it got to 99/72 and last check was 120/65. He did not want the ambulance or to go to urgent care. We told him to take it easy the rest of day and to have somebody with him til next morning. And then he and his friend left to go to his parents house.

I ran outside of the pharmacy to assist him. He was conscious but confused for a few moments. Then said he felt fine. Patient showed no signs of allergic reaction. I asked him if he had any injuries/bleeding and he said no. I asked him to stay at the pharmacy for another 30 minutes so I could observe him closely. We gave him a cup of cool water to sip on. At around 1:10 pm, I went outside the pharmacy to check on him again and he said he felt flushed and asked for a bucket.  At 1:15 pm, he vomited into the bucket. He said he felt 100% better after vomiting. I had him stay at pharmacy until shortly after 1:30 pm when he said he felt okay to go home. I called him at home around pm the same day and he said he felt fine.

                                                Directly after administration of the vaccine, the patient started to feel like he was going to faint and became nauseous. I got him some water and when I returned he was slouched in his chair. His leg and arms started to twitch for at least 10 seconds and he was incoherent. After the twitching stopped, he seemed to not have full recollection of the past minute and asked if he had passed out. His shoulder muscles were tight, he felt very warm, and soon after become nauseous but did not vomit. We gave him an ice pack to cool him down in addition to the cold bottle of water. We waited for a friend to come pick him up and during the wait he recovered and was able to hold a conversation, not feel dizzy, and stand up on his own. After 30 minutes of observation, the friend arrived so I walked with him out of the pharmacy to the car.

The patient did not receive any other vaccines 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccination. It was reported that, patient stated, he had his second dose of COVID Vaccine like 12 days ago. So he was still feeling dizzy on an unspecified date in 2021, and he was not able to concentrate on his work on an unspecified date in 2021. So he just wanted to know how long it would last. Patient stated that he experienced side effects mostly after the second shot. Patient had ibuprofen after the vaccine. Patient was still experiencing dizzy and was not able to concentrate on his work. Patient experienced only dizzy, weakness on an unspecified date in 2021. No investigation assessment. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Starting last night, after sweating an obscene amount, I started feeling dizziness. Not a normal dizziness, but a severe one with brain zaps. The type of brain zaps someone has when coming on or off affexor/venlafaxine (which I?m currently on). The dizziness only happens when I stand and the brain zaps happen more frequently than when the dose changes or is forgotten with the snri. Before someone asks... yes... I?m taking my affexor properly and haven?t changed how I?m taking it since my covid shot.

That feeling waxed and waned all day and improved in the evening. The next morning on Monday, December 21st I was 10/10 nauseous and near vomiting. I went to work but had to leave because of nausea. Ultimately I vomited upon returning home and was nauseous with abdominal pain and achy all day. The next morning on Tuesday, December 22 nausea continued but with a rating of around 6/10. Then came the intense headache, body aches, and fatigue. This continued into the next day  (Wednesday, December 23) prompting me to get COVID tested and take off of work on Thursday, December 24th.

                                                In the evening after getting the shot, I started getting chills and became more sensitive to cold temperatures.  Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

He fell from the bench to the floor where he landed on his stomach. When I ran over to him, his eyes were open but his body was limp. I tapped his back and asked if he was ok, and he was startled as if I woke him up from sleep. He was alert and was able to speak, he asked for water and I gave it to him. I asked of he wanted me to call emergency services but he declined. He then vomited in the waiting room trash can. His sister was with him and began to rub his back and fan him. I asked again if he needed to go to the hospital and again her declined. I told them to please wait in the lobby at least another 15 minutes before leaving and he did. I called to patient around 8pm to check on him and he said he was fine and had no more symptoms.

I had him sit down in the counseling room. 911 was called and ems was dispatched. in the mean time store management brought him water. I asked the patient again if he was having difficulty breathing and he said no, but he felt dizzy and his heart rate was elevated. I asked him if he had any difficulty swallowing, or any swelling of the lips, tongue, mouth or throat - pt denied all symptoms. patient also denied a rash or any itching when asked. I also asked the patient if he had any nausea, which he stated he did. he continued to deny all symptoms except dizziness, and nausea when asked, and in talking to him while waiting for emt he never displayed any symptoms that would lead me to believe he was having difficulty breathing, or a true allergic reaction. when emt arrived and examined him his pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation was normal, and the patient stated he felt better and had a history of anxiety. patient declined to go to the hospital, waited in the pharmacy for a while longer, and had a friend come pick him up

He was wobbly upon standing. We helped patient into bathroom as he still said he needed to vomit. Patient sat down on toilet and rested until he didn&#39;t feel nauseated. Patient stated he was ready to have his blood drawn. As we got him seated in the draw chair, The RN came back in. I explained that the patient became ill from the vaccine after she had left. She asked if he felt better now, he said yes and that was all that was stated/done.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 22Mar2021 at 12:30 at the age of 30 years-old, (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included dyspepsia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Severe Heartburn , blood pressure measurement from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Blood pressure , migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for blood pressure for 3 years and ongoing; pantoprazole (PANTOPRAZOLE) taken for stomach medication and heartburn for about a year. Patient states he got the first round 3 weeks ago and he is supposed to get the second dose next Monday but was advised by his doctor not to do that.      Patient states he got the shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and Tuesday 23Mar2021 he was tired and sluggish. On Wednesday 24Mar2021, mid afternoon, he had purple splotches all over his body, in arms and legs, like discoloration, his head felt like it had been dipped in cement and he couldn&#39;t think. States he felt cloudy, dizzy and woozy, nauseous, had a headache and feeling awful. States this occurred like 48 hours after the shot. He contacted a life long friend who is a doctor and works in a covid ward and he told him he was having a reaction and to take some Benadryl and Advil or Tylenol, and the friend told the patient to lay down and rest. He still didn&#39;t feel great but splotches went away and head felt a little bit clearer and he didn&#39;t feel like he was in slow motion or dizzy anymore by Wednesday evening, so he went to bed. On Thursday, the patient went into work but didn&#39;t feel great, not feeling 100%, and about noon on Thursday 25Mar2021, the symptoms started coming back, the purple splotches, his head felt just as bad, he had a headache, slow motion and not himself. The patient called his doctor and his friend and they said he needed to go in and get looked at. The patient tried to go into an urgent care and he states they said nope head to the ER. Patient states he was admitted into the ER and the ER staff said he was having more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave him steroids and an IV but he is not sure what it is and he was given, he thinks, Prednisone over the next couple days to help with side effects, he believes it was Prednisone, he knows it was a steroid. States he is not a fan of it and he doesn&#39;t like it at all. Patient states that he thought it was a pretty standard reaction and was not worried about it. Patient states he still gets headaches and maybe it&#39;s something else that is unrelated. States he stopped feeling tired and sluggish maybe the 29Mar2021, a week afterwards. Patient states that he has recovered with lasting effects as he&#39;s been getting migraines since then, states maybe it&#39;s unrelated but didn&#39;t happen a whole lot before. He has severe headaches and nothing he takes seems to help, has to turn lights off and works from home and patient reports that he had one yesterday. Patient states the purple splotches went away after he went to the ER and got on the medicine, the steroids.  P atient states the nausea was pretty constant when a headache comes on, he doesn&#39;t have a headache every day but when he gets a headache he is definitely nauseous.  The outcome of the events was for fatigue and sluggish, recovered with sequela, Purple splotches, dizzy and woozy slow motion, recovered, nausea and headache not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 30-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: ER8730) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 31Mar2021 15:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroid. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium taken for hypothyroid. The patient previously received tetanus vaccine (6 weeks out from his Covid Vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient stated that his side effects began on 01Apr2021. He noticed tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck. This was the same side of the body he got the vaccine on. His symptoms worsened over the next two days. He had increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck. On Saturday 03Apr2021. it took him a half an hour just to get out of bed. Stated that he went to the Emergency Room at the hospital where he works and they did a series of tests. He had CAT Scans with and without contrast, a MRI, and an Ultrasound. Mentioned later that they also did blood work (Apr2021). The Emergency Room doctor told the caller he was going to have his CAT scan read by a specialist. Caller stated they called him on Sunday 04Apr2021 and said his CAT scan showed an inflammatory infectious process with atypical organisms and Lymphadenopathy. He stated that he read that Lymphadenopathy was a side effect of the vaccine. They told him that the Lymphadenopathy was compressing the nerves in his neck and causing his pain and decreased range of motion. He had been on a week of treatment consisting of pain medications, muscle relaxers, and anti-inflammatory medications. The Infectious Disease was consulted and he was started on a 5 day course of Azithromycin. He was on the third day of this antibiotic per his report. He has a follow up MRI scheduled next Friday. He was calling to report his side effects and also to ask about what he should do in regards to his appointment for his second dose of the vaccination. His symptoms were worsening for the first three days. Since he has been being treated for them they have started to improve slowly day by day. Today he said there was minimal pain and tightness but he was still not back to one hundred percent. He was offered admission to the hospital for pain control after his emergency room visit but he decided to defer it to an outpatient setting. Was not admitted to the hospital. The patient felt that the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; were medically significant and stated they were disabling, at least temporarily. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; was recovering while unknown for the other events. Patient stated that he felt all of his adverse events were caused by the COVID Vaccination he received.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be excluded based on the temporal relationship. Case will be  reassessed if additional information is received. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

It looked as if he had slightly hit shoulder first with no obvious head injuries. He came to in about 5 seconds in which he mentioned the fact passing out had happened to him before and was common with shots. The paramedics quickly attended to him and took blood pressure which came back normal. He denied transport by ambulance.

A few minutes later, my pharmacy technician, was informed that patient had collapsed in front of the pharmacy. I was in the immunization room with another patient. I grabbed an Epinephrine 0.3mg auto injector and went to the patient. He was unconscious and unresponsive. I told him to call 911 and to send for paramedics. I administered one dose of 0.3mg epinephrine and patient woke up within a few seconds. He stayed sitting with me assisting as this was his most comfortable position. He later transferred to a chair and paramedics/emt took over when they arrived.

                                                Got vaccine in my car and parked. Had a little extra bleeding at the time of injection. Once parked, I had immediate and intense nausea. Very dizzy and light-headed. My hearing went away. I closed my eyes for a second and passed out. I awoke about ten minutes later covered in sweat. Felt better at this point and it was my time to leave, so I felt well enough to drive home at that moment. I should have reported the adverse event at the site.

Upon deciding that he had not received any of the vaccine, I administered a second dose bc the hub was split all the way down.   I administered it and left him to go wash my hands.  After about a minute, we heard a loud sound.  When I got to him, he was getting up and was pale. His face was white, hands clammy and sweating.  He did not remember falling.  I took his bp which was 99/65.  My tech went and got him some water.  He started drinking and then vomited.  He said he immediately felt better.  his girlfriend went and got him some juice.  He sat there for about 15 more minutes.  He sated that he felt fine, but he had not had anything to eat or drink that morning.  (also a beer the night before).  He got up and walked out without any help and was going to get him something to eat.  He was hungry.

                                                Light headedness, weakness, and subjective fever onset during the morning of 6/6 following injection of second COVID-Pfizer vaccine on 6/4 at approx. 4:30 p.m, and the initial even also included minor muscular spasms, headache, heartburn, and abdominal pain. These symptoms worsened throughout the day. My pulse felt weak. My breathing became rapid and shallow, even though it was not difficult to draw breath. The major symptoms on 6/7 were headache, with a sense of my motion being affected. My urine throughout this time was excessively dark, even though I was drinking more water than normal. The following day, 6/8, most of my joints began to heart, and I became very stiff; this sx lessened after taking a long, slow walk.  On 6/13 another event involving slowed heart rate, subjectively weak pulse, and shortness of breath ensued. There had been no unusual or excessive physical activity, and as I had not experienced this phenomenon before receiving the second vaccine dose on 6/4, I believe that the 6/13 event was also linked to the vaccination.

                                                Started feeling very fatigued around 6/7 PM on 1/7/21. Ate dinner shortly after and took my normal sleeping pills as previously listed. Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

                                                Within 2-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy.  I signaled for help while in my car  and help arrived. Within the next few minutes the severity seemed to go from ?0-100? and I began to feel a deep impending sense of doom and panic/fear. I also felt extremely tense in my muscles and felt itchy in the chest area. That continued for 15 minutes or so before subsiding slowly. Staff surrounded my car and were very supportive and great about the situation.   It was one of the most frightening experiences to date I have had. No EpiPen type intervention was done. Once the event was on the downswing I was kept for additional observation and release on my own accord.  Everyone there was great. I am reporting for my own records in case further testing reveals I have an allergy to this vaccine for employment purposes should the vaccine become mandated prior to me having alternative means of vaccination or allergy testing competed to determine if it was an true reaction or not so I can get vaccinated safely.

                                                Patient has a fear of needles, which was not mentioned initially. The patient got the vaccine and was told to have a seat outside the immunization room for 15 minutes at least to ensure no side effects. The patient wanted to get something in the store. Pharmacist was immunizing the next patient already. Patient knocked on the door and stated he didn&#39;t feel good and was dizzy. I told him  to take a seat I was going to get him some water. As he was about to sit down he passed out and hit the door with his head. EMS was called and patient was taken to hospital. The patient woke up 30 seconds after and was dizzy. He felt better after about 5 minutes.

                                                He had a vasovagal response. He was diaphoretic, had dilated pupils, and was seen drooping his head. He was attended to by RNs who checked his blood pressure and pulse. His BP was 60/30 and his pulse was in the 40s. He was laid flat with his feet up. His blood pressure was then rechecked a few minutes later and it had come up to 102/60. His pupils constricted back to a normal size and he said he was feeling better. He was given water to drink, observed for 30 minutes and walked out to his car by an RN after 30 minutes of observation. He did report that he does this with all vaccines. He was driven home by another driver.

                                                Monday afternoon 3/22/2021 I received the vaccine. The next day (23rd) I had dizziness and nausea started with stomach grumbling. 24th worsening nausea with some very green loose stools, still dizzy and started feeling fever, chills and then began loss of appetite. By the 25th &amp; 26th my condition had worsened. still had fever and chills, nausea &amp; lost appetite (could not eat anything). I was only drinking fluids by this time and I felt extremely fatigued and spent most of Thursday and Friday in bed recovering. By Friday I contacted my doctor, who said to go to urgent care if I didn&#39;t feel better on the weekend. Saturday my condition was the same and still on Sunday I was not any better.  By Sunday, I took myself to urgent care,  upon arrival, pulse was 124 with a temperature of 100.2F ..  the worst symptoms for me were all body weakness/fatigue &amp; fever/chills &amp; nausea. I was prescribed medicine for the nausea and tested negative for covid. In all it was almost 2 weeks before I felt recovered from the vaccine.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine, I felt very tired and winded as if I was working out for hours on no food. I did eat that day. I felt dizzy and saw black dots in my vision and felt the need to sit down. I never made it to sit, rather fell flat on my face and passed out for a few moments before my cousin came and picked me up asking what happened. It was very embarrassing and I believe the fall on my face caused an infection in my jawline on the left side and a sinus infection. I was throwing up and blowing my nose from blood. Very scary sight to see.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 I got the 2nd shot around 3pm and felt fine throughout the rest of the day. Around 10pm when I started feeling feverish. Around 11pm, while laying in bed, it started getting much worse - shaking uncontrollably, feeling nauseous, very dizzy, fever - flu like symptoms which seemed normal for the vaccine, but then they got much worse and very strong. I couldn&#39;t fall asleep and at 1am I got out of bed to get tylenol. I took the tylenol and was still feeling naeusous so went to the bathroom. I don&#39;t remember what happened next because I fainted and woke up on the floor. I hit my head in the fall and head to get 4 staples and  had a laceration above my eye. I think I may have fainted again shortly after that but don&#39;t remember because I was out of it. I went to the ER - all tests came back normal at that point. I had covid about 2 months before the vaccine. I had no side effects from the first shot.

                                                Patient received Covid-19 Vaccine (Pfizer). When pt stood up to walk out to immunization waiting area, he sat on the floor and stated that he was feeling lightheaded. Within 15 seconds, the patient fainted. Myself, a family member, and my certified immunization technician assisted the patient. A code white was called and so were EMS. My technician and I held the pt&#39;s feet above his head and laid him flat on his back to encourage blood flow back to his brain. He was unconscious for about 15 seconds before he woke up. When he woke, he stated that he often faints during/after seeing a needle and this is normal for him. Regardless, we awaited EMS&#39; arrival. EMS checked on the patient and determined he was safe to go home after his 20 min wait period. Patient declined going to hospital for examination as this happens to him often. He was monitored by myself and the store manager and was given water during his 15 minute post-vaccination monitoring.

                                                Upon receiving the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I immediately felt tingling or chills in the arm where the shot was administered.  This developed into muscle soreness as I sat through the waiting period before leaving the facility.  (For this reason, I had taken acetaminophen at about 8:30 that morning.)  I experienced both of these symptoms after my first shot of this COVID-19 vaccine, so these did not concern me.  After taking a nap back at my house, I woke up about 3:30 p.m. experiencing some partial numbness in my left arm, which received the injection.  It was not inhibitive, but I can somewhat relate it to the neuropathy my mother experienced before being diagnosed with diabetes in 2005.  It was a bit like the tingling I first experienced after the injection, but throughout the injected arm.  As I continued through that afternoon and evening, my arm kept getting stiffer and stiffer.  This prompted me to take my temperature at about 8 p.m. and then again at 10 p.m. Both of these tests resulted in a normal temperature of 98.3 or 98.4 degrees.  By the time I was about to climb into bed at midnight, the stiffness had spread to my shoulder joint -- such that almost any movement of that arm elicited some mild discomfort, especially if I leaned against the wall with that shoulder or raised my arm above my head.  I took a third dose of acetaminophen.  My normal prone sleeping position was not comfortable with this stiffness, so I did my best to sleep on my back.  Next, I woke up too hot about 3:30 a.m. (Wednesday, May 26) and could not get back to sleep.  Full-body chills set in soon after, prompting me to turn off my ceiling fan.  I faced some mild nausea as I attempted to get comfortable in bed again.  I suspected I was feverish by at least 4 a.m., but I did not get up to check my temperature until 5 a.m. The thermometer gave a reading of 100.3 degrees, so I took another dose of acetaminophen (my fourth in 24 hours) and tried to go back to sleep.

                                                Within a minute or less of receiving the shot, I experienced a rapid and intense onset of blurred vision, lightheadedness, profuse sweating, and extreme numbness all over but especially in my hands and feet. I came close to losing consciousness and was instructed to lay down with my knees bent to increase blood flow. I slowly came to over the course of probably 10 minutes while laying on the ground, but my hands and especially my fingers remained numb for 30-45 minutes while I experienced chills. My left hand and fingers were extremely pale and bluish during this time. I also had minor pains on the left side of my neck and left shoulder blade. Color came back to my left hand and chills subsided around an hour after my shot.

I am an avid runner, extremely healthy, no surgeries, and have never experienced anything like this in my entire life.

Dose 2 - I had very severe body wide nerve pain, vertigo, terrible migraines, vision issues, confusion, short term memory loss and grasping for words and increased muscle weakness. It kind of mirrored a stroke. The pain was a 10/10. It was basically like all of my symptoms were getting progressively worse over the weeks. It&#39;s gotten better, but the symptoms are definitely still there. My neurologist increased the dosage of a few of my meds. At this time, they&#39;re basically managing my symptoms, but we do not have a definite source for the issue. However, the vaccine definitely caused the flare up because nothing else in my life has changed.

                                                Shortly after receiving my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 30 Mar 2021, there was insidious and unilateral onset of pain of the left shoulder that quickly amplified in severity and intensity.  This pain was subsequently replaced over the ensuing days and weeks with progressive weakness, reflex changes, and sensory abnormalities in shoulder girdle musculature and proximal upper limb. The progressive neurologic deficits of motor weakness, dysesthesias, and numbness have persisted.  Subsequent tests (MRIs and EMGs) have been ordered to confirm and/or rule out possible causes of the event.

Around 6.5 hours after vaccination, while standing in my kitchen, I rapidly became very dizzy and fainted, falling to the kitchen floor. My girlfriend was there and said I hit my head on the floor, and was passed out for about 5 seconds before regaining consciousness and slowly coming back to myself. I reminded dizzy for another 20-30 minutes and had to stay laying down, before I was able to come to my feet and feel not dizzy anymore. I had plenty of food and water, so this event felt directly related to the vaccine.

I was forwarned that the first dose primes the immune system, 2nd can be worse, so I was taking 600 mg Motrin q6 hours. Despite that, my arm progressively hurt worse and worse until now I can?t lift it above my waist. Full body aches and pains. Horrible chills and so cold. 102.1 F is highest temp so far, but that?s on top of scheduled Motrin.   Still glad that I got it, but man does it suck right now.

Pt states that this is sudden onset today. he is unsure if it is related to the recent covid vaccine but has otherwise been well. He has no recent viral sx. He has no other neuro sx. He did have some pain in the jaw at the onset but that has since resolved. CT head obtained more for the jaw pain and to ensure no mass etc. It is normal. I discussed at length with the pt that I suspect this is bells palsy as he has very minimal movement of the forehead, cannot fully blink the L eye closed and has no risk factors for stroke. I did offer him further imaging to make 100% sure this is not a stroke but he agrees that he feels he has bells palsy and declined further labs or imaging. i will have him f/u with ENT as an OP. Given return precautions and f/u with them in the office. Given first dose of steroids and valacyclovir here. He will use artificial tears and tape the eye at night. .

I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

                                                Patient received his vaccine and was waiting in the post-vaccination waiting space. Within 5-10 minutes he slumped in his chair and became unresponsive. Became responsive to voice but was slurring his words. Patient was diaphoretic. HR in 90s, O2 98%. His eyes rolled back in his head  suspecting vasovagal episode, we moved patient to the floor  and raised his legs. He became more responsive. Was fully oriented although did not seem incredibly alert. Cycled multiple BPs with 100s-110s/60s-70s. HR 70s-80s  supine, O2 sat 96-98%.  EMS was called for transport to ED given patient&#39;s lack of prompt recovery. We  attempted to sit patient up and he again became lightheaded and had to lie back down. While in supine position, remained with normal and stable VS. At no time did he manifest any rash, respiratory symptoms, throat or chest tightness,  abdominal discomfort, or other overt signs of anaphylaxis.   Patient was transported to the ED where ROS was reported as:   - CONST: &#43;fatigue, denies fevers or chills  - EYES: Denies vision changes  - ENT: Denies rhinorrhea, sore throat  - CV: Denies new chest pain  - RESP: Denies SOB or cough  - GI: Denies abd pain, n/v, diarrhea  - GU: Denies dysuria  - MSK: Denies new joint swelling or pain  - SKIN: Denies new lesions or rash  - NEURO: Denies new HA, numbness, or weakness  - PSYCH: Denies suicidal ideation Vitals: BP 116/67, O2 99% on RA, Temp: 97.7F, Pulse 79.  ED provider felt this was most likely vasovagal episode given occurrence following vaccine administration and associated sxs. EKG without evidence of dysrrhythmia. No PE risk factors, SOB or CP. Pt with HA that was not thunderclap nor severe in nature and was consistent with prior migranes, thus do ot suspect SAH. No hx to suggest anemia and no anemia on blood work today. No report of  seizure. Pt is alert without report of post-ictal period.

Pharmacist instructed patient to sit down on the ground and as they crouched down to do so, he passed out and his wife caught him and eased him to the ground. Patient then regained consciousness in less than 30 seconds and remained on the ground for 15 minutes with legs propped up.  911 was contacted and fire dept came to check patient&#39;s vitals.  Patient reported feeling a lot better after the wait period and vital signs were reported normal.  Consultation was provided and patient instructed to follow up with primary MD, and patient went home.

By the weekend it hadn?t gotten worse to the point where I couldn?t leave the bedroom due to the walls literally spinning. That?s as the worst day then it progressively lessened until it went away by the second week.  Thought it was worth a mention.  My gf that I live with has also had ringing in her ear non stop since the second vaccine, so I?m a little concerned about the second shot.

He was in his usual state of health and doing well until he received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine around 0740 this morning.  Around 10 minutes following the vaccine, patient became short of breath, lightheaded and had his vision gray out before losing consciousness for few seconds.  Patient was sitting in a chair at that time and did not fall or hit his head.  He was then given juice and was able to ambulate and felt better.  Patient was directed to the emergency department for evaluation.  He states that he now feels back to his baseline with no lightheadedness or difficulty breathing.  Patient states that he has passed out following blood draws in the past and usually lies down afterward. Patient&#39;s presentation is overall most consistent with vasovagal syncope, especially given his history of similar events following blood draws.   Patient was observed in the emergency department for nearly an hour and remained asymptomatic so he was discharged home with return precautions

                                                I have been experiencing Vertigo, Balance issues, nausea since  April 5th, more than 10 days after the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. I have been to primary care and neurologists, no concrete answer on cause or treatment. This vaccine is the only different thing I did since I work from home during weekdays.  Nausea has tapered off but balances issues still prevalent and difficulty in walking in a straight line and driving. Vertigo medicines are of no help either

About 14 minutes after receiving the shot, he passed out while sitting on a chair and was found on the floor (5:45pm). He regained consciousness almost immediately and he stated he was dizzy and lightheaded. He also stated he only ate one spinach salad during the day and is trying to lose weight. We gave him water and a protein bar to eat. He slowly sat up on the floor, sat in a chair, and then stood. His fiance came to pick him up and drive him home. When called on 4/9, he stated that he was doing well and having no adverse reactions.

At 3:57 PM, the pt came to the Observation desk, and stated, &#34;I don&#39;t feel right.  I feel like I&#39;m going to pass out.&#34;  Observation crew assisted the pt to the chair.  The pt went completely &#34;stiff&#34;.  The pt was caught by Observation crew and did not fall to the floor.  During this state, the pt had what sounded like snoring respirations.

Pt was tapped, and verbally asked if he could hear us. Initially there was no response. Checked for breathing, then begin checking for pulse, but he came to. He started speaking with us, saying he was feeling light headed, and got up to notify us, but then he couldn&#39;t remember the rest. Asked if he had a history of seizures or diabetes and he said no to either. At some point he went out again, briefly. Meanwhile, the tech called 911. He came to again, begin talking with us. At some point he requested water, which we got. After seeping, he wanted to sit up. We asked him to place his back against the wall, if he wanted to. He did so, and after a few seconds said he wanted to lay down again. EMS came. They asked if he wanted to go to the ER which he consented to. They rolled him out on a stretcher.

About 10 minutes after his vaccination, patient fell off his chair to the ground and had a syncopal event. He appeared to lose consciousness for a few seconds and then became alert. He had a slightly bloody nose, which we cleaned up. We laid him down on the floor and monitored his blood pressure while applying a cool compress to his forehead and neck.  He was doing fine, so we continued to monitor him for another hour. He mentioned he had not eaten since the night before at 5pm. We gave him a protein bar and some juice and water( after about 1/2 hour) and he felt much better.   We advised him to contact his doctor if he did not feel better later today. Patient received a ride home.

                                                I received 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine on 25th Apr-2021. On 26th Apr, I felt some dizziness, body aches and sleepiness all the day. In the late night of 26th Apr while I was sleeping, suddenly I felt serious gastric problems. It also felt like heartburn. I walked around 2 hours in my apartment in the late night. I had plenty of water also. I had to take some Coke to burp up the gas.  After ~2 to 3 hours, I relaxed. Maybe this is not a serious adverse event, but as a responsible person, I had to share my experience.

                                                I had one large cup of coffee with cream and 3 doughnuts for breakfast approximately 3 hours before the vaccine. I took one Claritin Readitab approximately 2 hours before my vaccine injection to help with pollen allergies.   I was seated during the vaccine injection.  The injection was delivered into upper left arm. I felt fine at first. I stood and exited the room and began speaking with the pharmacist that had delivered the invention to receive instructions. Approximately 2-5 minutes after I received the injection I began to feel dizzy. After approximately 1 minute of dizziness I sat down.  I began to get extremely dizzy to the point of faintness. I noticed during this time that I was getting very sweaty. My skin over my whole body seemed to me to be damp from sweat and where I checked I was sweating visibly (no droplets formed? it was just dampness). At the same time I experienced nausea. I believed that I might throw up, so I requested something to throw up into. I never threw up. I continued to get more and more dizzy and I had trouble remaining upright (while seated). A woman observing me stated afterward that my eyes rolled back and that I fainted. I do not believe that I actually fainted because I remember hearing her tell the pharmacist that I had passed out. I had my eyes closed though, so it is possible that I fainted briefly.  The pharmacist called 911. I began to feel better approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I stopped sweating, and then the nausea subsided, and then my dizziness cleared up.   The EMTs arrived approximately 20 minutes after I received the vaccine and took my blood pressure. I do not remember the reading, but the EMT stated that it was not elevated. My blood oxygen was 99%. The EMT waited about 10 minutes and took my blood pressure again. He stated that it was higher, but not concerning. The EMT waited another 10-15 minutes and then left. Before he left, the EMT stated to me that I was one of 2 concurrent calls regarding adverse vaccine responses.   After this event I drank a bottle of  water. It did not seem to have an impact.   I have not received vaccinations since I was a child. I do not remember adverse reactions to injections when I was a child. I did pass out when giving blood approximately 12 years ago. I have always attributed this to the fact that I did not eat or drink for 20 hours prior to donating blood.

A 32-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 06Mar2021 09:45 (lot number: EN6205) at the age of 32 years old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Initially the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, his diagnosis was changed to rare reaction to a vaccine as per ER report in the hospital. They changed the diagnosis because it was not only his face drooping (reported as drooling) but he did not have a knee reflex or any feeling in his hands, and severe muscle pain all over his body to the extent he can&#39;t move. At the hospital they excluded Lyme disease by blood work and stroke and spinal infection by spinal tapping. Then he was discharged. All events occurred on 12Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. AEs resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab (COVID-19 PCR test): negative on 13Mar2021; and on unspecified date, blood work which excluded Lyme disease and stroke and spinal tapping which excluded spinal infection. Corticosteroid was given as treatment for the events. The patient has not recovered from the events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and an implied temporal association, the reported events are considered possibly related to BNT162B2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                72 hours after receiving my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed a pain on the right side of my neck, which then led to a headache on the back right side of my head.  I began seeing black spots in my vision, which then developed into kaleidoscope vision affecting both eyes but in my left field of view.  I took ibuprofen and laid down with a cold compress.  The vision issues lasted for approximately 30 minutes.  The headache and neck pain persisted until the next morning which was accompanied by vertigo.  I then decided to go to the ER and was diagnosed with a migraine with aura.  I have never experienced a migraine or visual problems before.  The doctor at the ER recommended I make this report in case my symptoms are linked to the vaccine.

He was unsure if the vaccine was the cause because at the time the dizziness occurred he had just taken a 45 minute very hot shower (which is longer than he normally takes) and thinks may have dehydrated him. He states lost his balance after the shower as he was getting out of the shower.  Did not report any other episodes of the dizziness.

                                                I felt very lightheaded and woozy roughly 5 minutes after injection. I was found passed out on the bathroom floor shortly after, with no recollection of entering the bathroom. It was estimated I was out for a couple minutes. I personally wondered if it caused blood pressure to drop, but I had no way to test it and was more focused on sitting up at the time. I stayed in the waiting area until I was confident I was able to walk on my own. A second wave, though less intense, happened roughly 30-45 minutes after the first. I left the store after 2 hours with fatigue, arm pain, and the hand of the opposite arm shaking on its own. The hand stopped shaking roughly 3 hours after the injection.  Fatigue was mostly gone in a day. I could not raise my arm above chest height without pain the 1st day. Today is day two and I can raise it up properly again with mild stiffness and slight twinges of pain.

                                                Extreme fatigue, loss of appetite, upset stomach/nausea, trouble sleeping, noticeable vision getting worse (already wear glasses: last check up was March 2018) Headaches/light headedness persisting over the last few weeks. Sometimes I can feel my heart pounding. General feeling of unwell and not normal.   The extreme fatigue has subsided, but I was unable to work from 04/23-05/02.   Temp had remained normal throughout and never reached above 99.6. Took a rapid test on 04/23/2021 at Urgent Care, and a lab test from pharmacy for COVID on 05/23/2021; both came back negative.

                                                In the morning of May 2nd I was driving and I felt my heart rate increasing lasted about 30 minutes to an hour. I ended up going to the ER and I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia, I stayed overnight. After that event I developed a cognitive fog and a sensation of numbness on the left side of my head like someone is pulling the skin on my face ever so slightly. I also developed a sense of imbalance like I am in a boat for an extended period of time. These feelings remained constant and I noticed that they were getting better by May 19th. At 6 am on May 19th I walk up to the feeling of my heart pounding and my heart rate increasing, I measured my pulse on my watch and it was around 150 bpm average. This event lasted about 5 minutes and went away. On May 19th around 10 pm I was in the shower and my heart rate increase again and I felt a tickling sensation on the left side of my chest when I was breathing in. I ended up going to the ER gain and stayed overnight. May 26th I felt the sensations of fogginess and just feeling off cognitively. May 27th I woke up rested without fogginess and after a morning walk with my dog I felt my heart increasing. This episode lasted about 10-20 minutes and my heart rate was ranging between 120-150 bpm. My stools from April 20th till May 26th have been lighter in color yellowish and soft, when I consumed vegetables I could see specs of them in my stools like they were not fully processed. May 27th was the first day where my stool color was brown but still soft.

I continued to feel like I was unable to perform at peak athletic performance. The second shot caused whole-body inflammation and another week of malaise and a cloudy mind. After one month I am still &#39;off&#39; and have had several episodes of nearly passing out with prolonged dizziness and fatigue, and am concerned about a heart complication from vaccination.

He got lightheaded and passed out as he was bending over. The patient hit his head and briefly passed out. We got him to the ground slowly and provided him with an ice pack and bottle of water. He was breathing quickly and shallowly for about 30 seconds but returned to normal shortly after.

                                                After receiving the vaccine the patient was instructed to sit at the designated post vaccination area. As he was sitting in the chair, a few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient lost consciousness and fell from the chair onto the floor. The patient was unresponsive for a few seconds. When I positioned him in an upward position he regained consciousness and did not remember what happened. The patient had a fast heart rate and was feeling hot, dizzy, and nauseated. He showed no signs of anaphylactic/allergic reaction. Patient admitted he was nervous and anxious about the vaccine and does not like needles. I instructed the patient to remain seated on the floor and gave him an ice pack, water, and told him to take deep breathes. Patient stated he felt better. The store manager and I called 911 to get paramedics to check his vitals. Patient denied to go to emergency room, said he was feeling better. Patient confirmed he lived only a few blocks away and he had someone to drive him. Paramedics cleared the patient and stated all vitals were in normal range. Patient stayed at the pharmacy for 10 more minutes after that with instructions if he felt any symptoms to call his doctor or 911.

                                                Fatigue; light-headed; nausea; physical weakness; headache; body ache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 32-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07May2021 07:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0185) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to peanuts and shellfish allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. After the administration of first dose, the patient experienced fatigue lasting from 2 days after dose through receiving 2nd dose, light-headed, nausea, physical weakness, headache and body ache. Following questions of what were caused can&#39;t be answered. The patient received full-time care while bedridden first day and a half from his partner and continue to receive care daily as he was not able to accomplish much on his own at this point. He does not know if this was a permanent condition caused by the vaccine nor does he know what the extent of any permanent damage was. This was the worst his body has ever felt. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                I received the first covid vaccination in May 5th and a week or so later started getting tingling in my toes that would come and go.  I did not tie it to the vaccine at first as it was not a listed side effect I saw.  On 5/26/2021 I received the second shot and the tingling spread to more of my toes, and then into my hands a few days later.  After another few days my legs became very weak and I went into the Emergency Room where they diagnosed me with Guillain-Barre and my symptoms continued to worsen where I lost all my reflexes and ability to walk as usual

                                                First of all, does anyone care? Will anyone contact me? I doubt it. That being said, my level of exhaustion since the shot is INSANE. I can barely walk 5 blocks, the more I walk the more tired and heavy my legs feel. I can barely keep my arms up for extended periods. I went to Physical Therapy and my therapist there tried to test the reflexes in my legs and I had NONE. That has never happened to me before. This is because of the vaccine. It?s been a week and it?s only getting worse not better. I almost don?t have the energy in my hands to write this much. Who is going to contact me? Is this going to get better? The gov?t is coercing people to take a vaccine and I want to know who is going to care when it affects me this badly!? Seriously. It?s quite sad. I keep filling this things out and no one contacts me. Should I wait? Go to ER? My doctor doesn?t seem to care much because everyone blindly thinks this vaccine is safe. I?m worried and confused. Thanks for whoever actually read this. I am sure I won?t be contacted.

I sat back down for a few more minutes and then I went back to work. The the tingling stopped but my legs felt heavy for 3 days. I am feeling normal now. I am aware of orthostatic hypotension and the possibility of it being from sitting in the chair and pinching nerves. I just wanted to report this in case it is a problem.

After 1 hr symptoms subsided as I was looked after by 3 nurses. Then last night I woke up at 3 am with body aches, chills, difficulty breathing, lightheaded, tremors, sore arm, elevated heart rate, and swollen injection site. By 6:30 I was sitting up but still too weak to stand. By 9 am I am still lightheaded, sore arm, body aches, and fatigue.

                                                While driving home in traffic from getting the vaccine, I felt a tingling over my whole body and then everything started to spin (vertigo). This lasted for about 10 seconds of severe vertigo and then stopped. I thought that was weird and kept driving (was in stop and go traffic) then about 1 minute later it started again and thankfully I was stopped at the time in traffic. I leaned my  seat back slightly and called my wife to tell her where I am. I couldn&#39;t pull over because there was a cement barrier on one side and 4 lanes of traffic on the other. I kept on the phone with her for the remained of my drive and it occurred one more time when I was driving home. Once home, a couple more times I felt it coming on but it didn&#39;t ever happen again. I took my blood pressure and it was normal, boarderline high when I got home (140/84). The next morning I had a fever and severe muscle aches and body aches which lasted most of the day and then today I&#39;ve felt totally fine (today being 1/23).

                                                second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine on 11Jan2021; little pain around the injection site; some nausea; some bouts of dizziness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 33-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose on right arm, mid bicep for COVID-19 immunization. There were no patient history. Concomitant medications included hepatitis b vaccine on 14Dec2020, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]), calcium and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number:EK5730) on 18Dec2020 (left arm) and he experienced little pain around the injection site, some nausea and some bouts of dizziness. The patient received the Covid 19 Vaccine 4 days after receiving the Hepatitis B vaccination, so he identified this as an error in administration. So the Hepatitis B vaccination was given on 14Dec2020 and the first Covid 19 Vaccine was given on 18Dec2020. He received the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that originally the prescriber who administered it the first two doses had scheduled him to receive the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine as the same day as his second Hepatitis B Vaccination and he identified this error last Wednesday and stated &#34;I believe or potentially today, I&#39;m not sure which one I&#39;m sorry I had to check with that&#34;. So, he was trying to get this all cleared up. He did report symptoms for both Covid Vaccines as little pain around the injection site, some nausea, some bouts of dizziness. So, patient had already discussed the common adverse reactions with him. Patient was told that co-administration has not been studied yet and referred him to his HCP for continued guidance on how and when to space out the additional Hepatitis B vaccination that he will need. Patient was &#34;32&#34; back in December when this happened. He had his birthday and turned 33. Second shot for the Covid was scheduled the same day the Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) but due to inveigle in-charge of the vaccine, he had lost his paper work and he had been on vacation and stated &#34;had been vaccine was not found they just gave me the second Covid Vaccine and told me to come back by Thursday and I should have found it and have everything cleared up by then but then Wednesday they called me and told me that they have realized that they are not supposed to give vaccine co-administered with 14 days window before or after. I haven&#39;t got my second Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) just the first one was administered within the 4 days period of the first shot&#34;. Patient work at Dietary Providence. The patient had his blood drawn this morning (20Jan2021). Patient does not have product details for hepatitis B vaccine. Patient stated that the nurse on duty had said that the vaccine they had stocks was &#34;Engerix-B hepatitis B recombinant&#34; but that was not verified as far as definitively is just what she had stocked when he was going on his incident report. Patient further stated, &#34;As far as all things are concerned you know I went to a doctor got checked he said breathing was great, heart rate was great, oxygen level 98 percent, he has drawn blood by then is there anything that I should be doing at this point cataloging thing any other test any other people to contact. What should I do going forward specially what can I do to be helpful for you guys to get this situation clear.&#34; Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I started having vertigo every once in a while. It was frequent, but short. Like if you stand up really fast and it goes away, but it happened when I was sitting down. Around the 7th, it got worse and I sought treatment at ER. They gave me fluids, but couldn&#39;t find out why it was happening. It&#39;s been gradually getting better.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I started having radicular tingling with neck flexion that ran down my left leg starting at the beginning of February. I noted it to a colleague and asked if anyone else who had received the vaccine at the same time as me had any similar effects. I was the only person noted. Slowly the tingling increased and began radiating the entire length of the left leg. It only last for a few seconds at the beginning of flexion then completely resolved. I did not think much of this at the time and figured that it would resolve. On February 27, I began having visual disturbances and symptoms similar to vertigo with a severe nystagmus with a gaze the the right. I attempted a round of azithromycin at this time thinking that there may be an ear infection and that was causing my visual/vertigo like symptoms. There was no improvement with this course of treatment and the visual issues were becoming more of a regular issue. It became hard for me to focus anytime that I would look to my right but was able to focus my eyes while looking forward and the the left. At this time, I opted to have a brain MRI done which was completed on Match 9th as well as having basic labs run. I ended up with an elevated white count on my labs with a left shift. My MRI was read the same day showing a demyelinating process. Multiple neurologist were consulted on this and they believe that my symptoms are not related to MS as the radiologist listed as his top three on his differential but rather what they called post-covid vaccine syndrome, similar to what they are seeing with patients who actually had COVID. I have no medical history, I am not taking any medications and had no symptoms prior to the vaccine. My symptoms were acutely brought on unlike MS and I do not have any of the four most common male characteristics of MS. I do not currently have any muscle weakness, I am not fatigued, it has not progressed to my upper extremities, it does not have a stalking glove approach but rather shoots down, I have no sexual dysfunction. I have been started on a high dose prednisone taper as recommended by the neurologist. My biggest concern is that when I looked for information as a medical provider, I was unable to find anything related to neurological issues and the vaccine. Once, I was placed in contact with multiple neurologist, I was told that they are seen quite a few neurological adverse events.

                                                The first adverse effect started a couple minutes after the injection. I felt lightheaded and dizzy and then I broke out into a cold sweat followed by blurry vision. I felt as though I was going to pass out. These symptoms lasted for approximately 10-12 minutes after starting and then I started to feel better. I then experienced a headache in just above the base of my neck in the back of my head and that lasted for approximately 5 minutes.

                                                About two hours after getting the vaccine I started having flu like symptoms. The arm where I got the shot started aching, it felt a lot like tennis elbow. I got waves of intense nausea. My nose began running. I developed a sore throat.  I got waves of light headedness, occasionally feeling like I may pass out. And I was extremely thirsty. No matter how much water I drank, my mouth was dry and I felt severely dehydrated. This lasted for about three and a half hours and then passed and I felt normal again.

I had him lie down on the floor with his feet up for about 10 minutes until he felt confident to sit in the chair for another 10 minutes or so.  As he was lying on the floor, We brought him a bottle of water.  His color came back shortly after lying down on the floor.  He stated that he has previously had panic attacks after shots, blood draws, etc.  He stated he was no longer dizzy when he stood up to leave.

                                                I received my first dose of the pfizer vaccine at 11am at the safeway pharmacy. I had consumed several glasses of water in the morning before the event, a cup of yerba mate tea, and a piece of toast. I smoke, and had smoked one cigarette in the morning before my appointment. Just after receiving the vaccine I ate a few pieces of jerky and maybe 15 Jojo potatoes from the safeway deli.  I was advised to wait 15 minutes before leaving. I set an alarm. I bought some food to eat (jojo potatoes and jerky) and waited to leave the site until 11:22am. I felt strange/weird, but this isn&#39;t an unusual feeling after receiving any kind of shot/vaccine for me.   I was driving to work and I started to feel just a little bit strange after smoking another cigarette. I got a little nauseous but nothing too bad. Thirty seconds later I started to get dizzy, my ears rang, I felt my blood pressure drop, and I passed out on the interstate going freeway speeds. I woke up around a minute and half later according to my brother who was on the phone. I was treated for injuries at emergency room.

                                                While taking a warm Epsom salt bath I started to feel faint. About 1 minute after getting out of the bath my vision became worse and I fainted. I was alone at the time so I dont know if hitting my head on the floor or the fainting caused loss of consicousness. I was out for 20 min to 1 hour. Lost 4-8 oz of blood from bloody nose caused by hitting my head on the floor.

Within 24 hours severe shortness of breath and severe chest pains. Went to 2 urgent cares. Was prescribed Prednisone and a Inhaler. Both did nothing. Symptoms got worse. went to my primary doctor who ordered a chest X ray which came back good. and a EKG which came back with a slight issue and referred me to a cardiologist next month. Was sent home to recover. Pain and shortness of breath got worse. Within a week after that i got severe headaches and the left side of my head arm and leg began to get numb and tingle sensation  which lasted about 48 hours. About 2 weeks after vaccine i began to improve. Chest pain started to go away and my shortness of breath as well. As of today 4-18-2021 no chest pain, and shortness of breath still comes and goes but nothing compared to weeks before.

                                                I began experiencing severe neck pain the morning after I received my first vaccine. The first morning, the pain was so intense that I was unable to lift my head out of bed and consequently had to lift the back of my neck with one hand to sit up in bed. I?d never experienced this kind of neck pain before.  The pain level was equally intense over the next several days until I started taking ibuprofen . I even went to the chiropractor to receive an adjustment to help reduce the pain. However, as of today,  I am still experiencing significant neck pain that is effecting my activities of daily living.

Written off a psycho and about to be committed, but was brilliant.  I believe I was given an undiluted dose of Pfizer without diluent, and became psychotic, and furthermore I believe my parents, who also got it, have had their judgement affected as well.  They have been a lot less urgent with concern for their welfare of me since the shot. All they do is sleep all the time, wouldn&#39;t take me to the ER even when I was having trouble reading and staggering around.  I understand I have no credibility here, but please look into this matter seriously, and not just the ravings of a crazy person.

Got better for three or four days then,  At first, dizziness and lightheadedness upon standing up, nearly fainting.    Within another week, intermittent heart racing, elevated blood pressure episodes followed by headaches.    By three weeks out from second dose my headaches became constant, some devolving into migraines, relegating me to my bed.  Headaches are now constant, from morning until night, intermittent heart racing and bouts of light headedness are nearly every day.

While on the way home, I developed rash on my both arms and felt dizzy. I pulled over to a parking lot but before I could park my car, I passed out. I couldn&#39;t control my car and I bumped into another parked car. All this happened in a matter of 15 seconds. My wife and my daughter was with me. When I regained consciousness, my wife was doing CPR on. A bystander in the parking lot called EMS for me.

Every few minutes, I feel dizzy (sometimes triggered by head movement) accompanied by a general sense of imbalance. I don&#39;t have any history this kind of dizziness before.

He has to hold on to walls to walk.; Patient started to get terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness.; patient cannot walk; Severe back pain; both feet have numbness and tingling; This is a spontaneous report from Pfizer. A contactable nurse (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 33-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 13Apr2021 13:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0153) (at the age of 33 years old) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included surgery on his leg (when he was 17) and cold. There were no concomitant medications. Patient had a severe reaction to the covid vaccine. On 17Apr2021 at 08:00, the patient had severe back pain. On Sunday morning (25Apr2021), patient had severe back pain. Patient was a former college athlete. Patient was mentally healthy and physically fit. Patient did not remember getting hurt while playing golf. Patient iced his back and did some stretches. Patient called his friend who is a doctor, and his friend told him he did the right thing by icing and stretching.  A few days later, either Tuesday evening, 27Apr2021 or Wednesday, 28Apr2021, patient started to get terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness. Patient was able to get down a flight of stairs and then called an uber. Patient was taken to the hospital. It was his left foot and left leg initially. Now both feet have numbness and tingling. It was hard for him to walk. He has to hold on to walls to walk (also reported as Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness. Patient cannot walk. Patient can now only stand if he is holding a wall).  He went to the emergency department on 29Apr2021 and got an MRI of back and lower legs, &#34;all was negative for slip disc or spinal cord swelling.  Patient had an MRI of his lower back, and legs. The MRI results were that patient had no spinal cord compression that would cause his left lower leg numbness. Patient was admitted to the hospital, to the neurology department, with a consult for a neurosurgeon to see him. The doctors agreed that he had something going on since he had left lower leg numbness. In the course of four days, Thursday through Sunday, patient was admitted to hospital in the neurology unit. Patient was in an overflow area. Several hospitals around that area have closed, so now the hospital is seeing so many more patients, and the hospital is over capacity. Patient was admitted by a hospitalist, and then was referred to a neurology team. The doctors said that that does not explain patient&#39;s symptoms, so the doctors ordered a head to toe MRI with contrast.  He was admitted to the hospital and continued to have severe back pain then, the doctors did another head to toe MRI with contrast and then they said he has &#34;MS due to brain lesions and spinal cord swelling the length of his spinal cord.&#34; They also did a spinal tap. The family kept telling the MDs that he had just received his Pfizer vaccine. The patient denies any weakness or numbness in past 6 months. He continues to have numbness in both feet and now the left leg is always numb. The doctors gave him an outpatient appt at the end of June. It felt like whenever he sits on his foot while watching TV, and it starts going numb. By the time that patient was getting testing done, the nurses covered patient&#39;s eyes, and told patient to tell them whenever he could feel it. The doctors and nurses were sticking pens in patient&#39;s feet, and patient could not feel it at all. Patient could only feel pressure. On Friday, 30Apr2021, patient had a head to toe MRI with contrast. Reporter thinks that patient got back to his room after the total body MRI about 22:15. The head to toe MRI with contrast revealed that patient had spinal cord swelling, and lesions in the brain. Doctors diagnosed patient with multiple sclerosis. Patient has never had any symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Reporter&#39;s husband feels like patient could have transverse myelitis, because some vaccines can cause that. Reporter&#39;s husband asked patient&#39;s doctor to contact Pfizer to see if there was anything in place about how to treat this. On Thursday, patient&#39;s doctor told reporter&#39;s husband that there had been no reported adverse effects of spinal cord swelling from the covid vaccine. On Sunday, whenever patient was discharged, patient&#39;s doctor told reporter&#39;s husband that he was not going to call and report about patient to Pfizer, and that there had already been 45 documented cases. This was a really big red flag to reporter. Patient cannot walk. Patient can now only stand if he is holding a wall. Before this, he was totally healthy. Patient was discharged from the hospital on Sunday. The hospital sent his MRI results, lab work, and spinal tap fluid after his MRI to Clinic. The doctors did the spinal tap on patient to make sure he did not have an infection. Patient did not have an infection. The doctor started patient on Lyrica and some other drug. The hospital told patient to call back in two weeks, because by then they would have stuff back from Clinic, and then he could make a follow up appointment. Upon discharge, patient was told that maybe he could get a follow up appointment in Jun2021. Everything that reporter has read, says that patient&#39;s condition needs to be followed up on as soon as possible. Patient cannot walk. This is going to financially cripple patient. Reporter is sure that after this, patient will meet his deductible and is going to have to pay out all of this money to cover his hospital stay and testing. Before the COVID vaccine, patient did not have any problems at all. Patient had to have surgery on his leg when he was 17. Patient has no history of back pain. By the time the doctors and nurses did testing, that was late Friday evening, 30Apr2021 or Saturday morning, 01May2021. By the time that the testing was done, both of patient&#39;s feet and left leg were totally numb. The hospital said that patient&#39;s symptoms were terrible, and that he had something acute going on. The hospital ran tests on patient. Patient told the doctors at the hospital that he had recently received the COVID vaccine. Patient was never sick he might get a cold every once in a while. Other than that, patient only sees the doctor once a year for a physical. The hospital did preliminary lab work on patient. Patient&#39;s vital signs were stable, and he had no fever.  After patient received three doses of IV Solu-Medrol, his back pain went away. Patient&#39;s doctors felt like patient&#39;s spinal cord swelling had diminished. Patient&#39;s doctors felt like patient&#39;s spinal cord swelling is what cause patient&#39;s numbness and tingling. The first dose of IV Solu-Medrol was given sometime on 30Apr2021. Patient received IV Solu-Medrol 1 gram, three days in a row.The doctors said that was all they were going to do at this time. The doctors wanted to wait to see what the lumbar puncture shows (unknown results). Patient was given IV Solu-Medrol while in the hospital. Patient was put on Lyrica and gabapentin. The doctors are hoping that those two medications will make his symptoms go away. Patient used to take a multivitamin for years, but reporter does not know if patient still takes that. Patient is super healthy. Patient was admitted to the hospital on 29Apr2021, and discharged on 02May2021 after receiving his last dose of IV Solu-Medrol. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had Nasal Swab (COVID test) on 28Apr2021 and was negative.  Event relatedness to Pfizer COVID vaccine: Severe back pain and Patient started to get terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness. Patient cannot walk. Patient can now only stand if he is holding a wall was related. Reporter stated that she thinks his symptoms are medically significant, but they could be disabling. If the COVID vaccine gave patient multiple sclerosis or transverse myelitis, this could be disabling. The outcome of the event back pain was recovered in May2021; event spinal cord swelling was recovering; events &#34;terrible numbness in his feet. The numbness moved to up his left leg. Patient could not walk because of his left leg numbness and It was hard for him to walk. He has to hold on to walls to walk&#34; were not recovered; and unknown outcome for the other events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the multiple sclerosis,  transverse myelitis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.   There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including spinal MRI at baseline, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

When I got back to him, he was already back awake.  Fire dept was dispatched and they checked his vitals and he signed a form to go AMA to the hospital.

                                                Approximately 2 weeks after the 2nd dose of the pheizer vaccine,  I started experiencing vertigo,  and a massive lack of energy.  Sometimes it gets so bad,  I have to sit down because it feels like I&#39;m going to collapse.  I have also experienced chest pains in the first month after the second shot,  but these have seemed to go away.  The tired and vertigo sensations are ongoing months after the shot.

A 34-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), intramuscular in left arm, on 08Jan2021 08:30, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, in the doctor&#39;s office/urgent care.

                                                I received my shot at 3:30 PM on 01/09/21.  I felt very tired on 01/12/21 before that went away that evening.  I began feeling dizzy and nauseus around 8:00 PM Monday, 01/11/21, and again periodically on 01/12/21.  The dizzy and nausea feeling continued consistently throughout 01/12/21 and 01/13/21.  I went to my primary care provider on 01/12/21 who gave me medication to help with nausea and dizziness.  She chalked it up to anxiety.  I became more worried on the evening of 01/13/21 and went to the ER.  The ER doctor stated it could be a reaction to the vaccine, inflammation in the ear/calcium buildup in the ear, or just my anxiety.  I do want to note I was nervous about getting this shot and have a history of having trouble distinguishing between true issues I am having and issues caused by my anxiety.  As of today, 01/15/21, I took Methazine which seems to have helped the dizziness, but not completely.  I am not currently nauseus.

About 12 hours later had severe arm pain limiting motion in L arm.  Slowly improved but never resolved.  Started to get worse again on day 7/8 with pain in deltoid, tricep, bicep, forearm.   Should pain on day 10 while in bed reaching for covers - limited ability to do normal task (lift arm to turn on turn signal).  No improvement with ibuprofen.  Right shoulder pain started the following day.  Was given medrol dose pack with some improvement for 2 days but bilateral shoulder pain worsened by day 2 of steroids.  Heard pop in Right groin while sliding in bed on day 3 of steroids.  Painful causing limping while walking for several days.  On 1/13/21, severe pain in groin when standing leading to ER visit (Xray negative).  MD described as tendonitis of adductor muscle.  Pain radiated down leg to knee and to hip.  The following day similar pains occurred in the left leg.  Pain &#34;bounced&#34; between bilateral upper and lower proximal muscles and tendons.  Had stiffening of R arm on 1/15/21 and 1/16/21 associated with numbness in hand.  Went to ED again.  inflammatory markers were negative.  ANA was positive for RNP antibodies but the titer was low.  rheumatoid factor low.  TSH normal.  ED MD said she would call it polymyalgia rheumatica but I was 40 years too young.  Bouncing severe neuralgia type pain lasted about 2 weeks.  It started to resolve with scheduled naproxen and daily physical therapy multiple times per day.  It&#39;s 2/13/21 and I am still taking NSAIDs and doing PT and have residual shoulder impingement with upward arm movements, have limited ability to lift objects that I previously could and also have difficulty standing for rounds (critical care clinical pharmacist).

A 34-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, Lot number EL0140, in Hospital, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 22Dec2020 (at 34 years of age) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prediabetes (glucose tolerance impaired) from an unknown date. The patient didn&#39;t have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included metformin and multivitamins. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced premature ventricular contractions, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, shortness of breath and chest pain. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care access and hospitalization as life threatening events. The patient was treated with diltiazem, fludrocortisone, aspirin and atorvastatin. He remained in hospital 2 days and then he was discharged. The patient underwent COVID-19 test (nasal swab) on 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 and both gave negative results. The patient had not recovered yet from the reported events at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events ventricular extrasystoles, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, dyspnea and chest pain cannot be excluded as the information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. The patient is a young adult with known prediabetes, but no other comorbidities reported. Information on tests done during admission, clinical course and working diagnosis would be helpful in further assessment of this case. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Left arm was incapacitated for nearly a week after the initial injection. Arm could not be lifted more than a few inches away from torso, and pain felt like severe deep cramping constantly. No bruising or mark at the site of the injection just severe muscle pain that affected all movement and sleep.  After one week I regained more mobility but still had severe pain in the shoulder muscles around injection site. At the 3 week mark I have more mobility but still struggle with a full range of motion and lifting anything more than a few pounds.

                                                I got vaccine on Friday3/19/21. Everything was good on Saturday but when I wake up on Sunday morning I realized that my neck is very stiff and I was not able  move my neck. The pain was very severe and was predominantly in the area of upper back and  right shoulder area.  I was on bed whole Sunday. On Monday i had the same issue. On Tuesday I got little improved. On Tuesday I can move my neck left and right with some pain but still I can?t move my neck downward. I call my doctor?s office and they told me to use over the counter pain medication and if I still have pain until Thursday then schedule office visit.

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

                                                I had a slight headache,  dizziness, and soreness  (at site of injection)  soon after the shot. The soreness went away however after a week I&#39;m still feeling a little bit of a headache and dizziness.  I&#39;m still able to function relatively fine. It&#39;s especially noticeable when I&#39;m just sitting down. When I&#39;m exercising I really don&#39;t notice it. It also tends to be worse in the evening.

                                                April 7, woke up with a headache, took ibuprofen. A few hours later, started feeling hazy, lightheaded and had trouble concentrating while working from home. Felt like I was going to pass out. Took a break from computer screen, symptoms appeared to subside.  An hour later, same haziness feeling came back. Thought I was going to pass out again. Called 911. ER diagnosed  me with near syncope. Told me to keep an eye on symptoms and come back if things worsen. I informed them I had received one dose of vaccine, they didn?t seem to think it was related.  Symptoms have slightly improved since, but still have bouts of dizziness four days later.

                                                I think the nurse practitioner put the injection too high in my shoulder. Within a couple hours of getting the shot, my upper right arm began to hurt. As the day went on it got worse. By evening it was the worst arm pain I have ever felt in my arm. I could not lift my right arm at all. ( I could lift my hand by bending my elbow but could not use my deltoid muscle). I could not sleep that night due to the pain. I took Tylenol every 4 hours which only slightly helped.  The next day it hurt the same amount - very, very bad. Felt like a truck hit my arm. Had to have my husband help me put my shoes on. I could not drive.  That second night I took more medication. The third day the pain finally subsided for the most part. On day four I was all better.

                                                At approximately 1010 the client lied down on the bleachers and reported feeling dizzy and not well, he was also visibly clammy.  He stated he usually feels that way after medical situations such as vaccinations and blood draws. Client was offered to go to a more private area and refused. MRC volunteer got cool paper towels to place on his forehead and client requested to continue  to lay down where he was. After about 10 minutes client wanted to sit back up and reported he was not as dizzy any more. He sat up with ease and no difficulty and he stated he was not feeling as dizzy. After sitting for a few minutes he received notification that his observation period was over and he stated that he was ready to go. I assisted him down the bleachers and out of the outreach facility, he had a steady gait and stated he was feeling, much better. He left the facility with his partner.

                                                Pain and throbbing in arm where I received the shot, especially the following morning.  It?s been recurring pain especially when I move my arm in certain ways. No health insurance at the moment, haven?t seen a physician about this or received an MRI.  The more concerning though is recurring vertigo I?ve been experiencing. I have never had it before, but a few days after I?m receiving the dose my eyes started shaking involuntarily and I had difficulty keeping my balance.  It went away after a bit, but has happened a number of times over the last two weeks.  I?m obviously hoping it just goes away.

When he came downstairs, he could not hold himself, and I noticed his mouth was tilted to the left with drooling, and weakness on his left side. We had him sitting in the chair and I drove him to the ER immediately.

Pharmacist was called to check on him, patient had pulse and was breathing steadily. Patient regained consciousness and was given a bottled water to drink. Patient was instructed to lay down and elevate feet to help recover. EMS was called to further evaluate and assist and arrived 5 to 10 minutes after incident. Patient was able to recover enough to walk out of store with EMS following without assistance.

Other symptoms: lightheadedness and fatigue continuing from 1 day after vaccination. Chest pain continued; going to a clinic was advised by multiple sources. At 9:00 AM, went to a clinic and got a CKG. The CKG was normal. I concluded that the problem was chest wall inflammation, and took ibuprofen. With ibuprofen, the chest pain was mostly gone by 8:00 PM.

I was very stressed about it and it had been six days since the shot, so I just assumed I was either having a heart attack or a really bad panic attack. I did a meditation and chewed a couple aspirin just in case.  There was extreme tightness in my chest. Breathing was difficult. The dizziness, nausea, and inability to control my body temperature went away within a couple hours and I managed to sleep. But the chest tightness and difficulty breathing persisted for about 3 or 4 days.  I also noticed it hurt more whenever I was sitting upright or forward, and it hurt almost zero when I leaned back or laid down.

                                                16 hours after my second shot, I woke up with some nausea.  I went to the bathroom, did not vomit, however in the middle of urinating I collapsed on the floor, couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t form full sentences, started sweating profusely, had to crawl back to my bed, and my pulse was through the roof.  I almost went to the ER, but the episode subsided within 15 minutes.   When I tried to fall back asleep, it felt like I was blacking out and not drifting asleep.  The next day, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms.  Followed by 4 days of normalcy.  On the 4th day, while working, I experienced a sharp 3 second &#34;electric shock&#34; feeling in my left side of my chest.   On the 5th day, I already had previously scheduled an appointment with my primary for a physical.  I told her about my episode; she took an EKG which yielded normal results.  Lab work also looked ok.  On the 6th day, I started feeling some more nausea and fatigue.  On the 7th day, the vertigo intensified tenfold, and the room was spinning.  That&#39;s when I started experiencing the following symptoms:  ? More nausea. ? Dizzy spells that come and go, especially after eating. ? Persistent periodic electric shock feeling in my left chest.  It?s dull but annoying.  And just when I think it?s gone for good, another 1 second shock happens. ? Left arm is  weak - the entire arm. ? When I try to sleep, the left side of my head feels as though I?m blacking out when I start drifting.  It almost feels like I?m getting anesthesia or something like that.  But just the left side. ? Basically the left side of my body (I got the jab in my left arm) from the waist up just feels off. ? One of my arms is numb when I wake up until I shake it out.  It?s not one particular arm. ? Energy levels are low.  Especially when I wake up and start moving around.  On the 8th day, I went to the ER thinking  perhaps it was a heart attack.  Nothing - EKG was again normal and lab work was normal.  The doctor told me it&#39;s all in my head - anxiety.  However, I&#39;m not anxious and I&#39;m a very level headed individual.    It&#39;s now day 12 and I feel overall awful.  I can&#39;t concentrate on anything.  I&#39;m not thinking clearly and forgetting simple things.  The dull feeling and electric shocks on my left side continue.  I&#39;ve never felt this bad before.  I&#39;m a healthy 34 year old that exercises regularly, has never smoked or done drugs, rarely drinks alcohol, and eats generally very healthy.  If given a second chance I would not take the covid shot.  I am praying this goes away.

So she referred me to an ENT , and he wants me to take nortriptyline , but I?m very cautious of taking a anti depressant! These events have brought great fear to me! I was perfectly normal before the vaccine! I would run everyday , workout and enjoy life! I haven?t been able to enjoy these things! Currently taking hydroxyzine for anxiety and high vitamin to get the inflammation done!  Must be a inner ear inflammation from the spike protein we think! I cry a lot , cuz I miss my life

A 34-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscular in Arm Left on 17May2021 (at the age of 34-years-old) (Lot Number: EW0187) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included higher than normal blood pressure, about 2-3 weeks ago, his blood pressure was very high due to really crazy stress in his life and eating terrible; headaches, smoked marijuana, drunk vodka, sometimes he had a sensitivity to needles, sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, Sometimes he got a little queasy with the sight of needles and just had a ton of dental work done. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (Generic Brand Zyrtec); caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN) taken for headaches. He explained he took Generic Brand Zyrtec which he had been on for years now and he took Excedrin for headaches when he got them. Those were basically the only medications he took really. He hadn&#39;t had any type of vaccine. He previously had a tetanus shot about 10 years ago for Immunization. There was no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine on Monday, 17May2021. Within 3-5 minutes of getting the vaccine, he had a really crazy reaction. He remembered looking at his wife and she told him he was having mild convulsions as he was sitting in the chair in May2021. He was kind of shaking in May2021. He turned ghostly white and he began sweating profusely in May2021. He mentioned that her wife said that he was not conscious for around 5 minutes and was &#34;snoring with eyes open&#34; in May2021. He added that he was &#34;fighting to stay awake&#34; for around 15-20 minutes after that. He blacked out. All he remembers was that he was trying to fight off tunnel vision for a very brief time in May2021. The pharmacist continuously checked on him. The lightheadedness and feeling like he was going to black out lasted 15-20 minutes in May2021. They put him in a chair and told him to elevate his feet, but the caller explains he could not elevate his feet. He had his feet in another chair in front of him. He couldn&#39;t get comfortable, he was sitting down. He was restless, lightheaded. He kept feeling like he was going to pass out. So, then he tried to stand up and walk a little bit. He only made it 5 steps. So, he sat on the ground and laid down. He laid on the ground, flat on his back, and put his feet in a chair, which was about 2.5 feet above him for about 15-20 minutes. He started to feel better. He still felt very tired and weak in May2021 but he was able to stand up and walk and go home. He hadn&#39;t had a reaction since. He had had no other symptoms besides just a sore arm in May2021. He confirmed he recovered completely from his experience when he was administered the vaccine. He came home from the vaccine facility, laid on the couch and watched TV for a couple of hours and then fell asleep for 3-4 hours. He was tired, but he felt completely fine. He had no lightheadedness, no dizziness. He also wanted to add sometimes he has a sensitivity to needles, but he didn&#39;t when he received the COVID vaccine. Sometimes he will have angst or nervousness with needles, but he was actually excited to get the COVID shot. He was even comforting his wife and was telling her everything is going to be okay. He wasn&#39;t worried about the needle with the COVID shot. Sometimes, he gets a little queasy with the sight of needles, but he saw the needle and he didn&#39;t feel faint or angst when getting the shot. He just had a ton of dental work done, where he had huge needles shoved in his mouth and he didn&#39;t feel faint or anything. He really wanted to get the second shot to finish the vaccination series. He did kind of believe he had a reaction, he was not trying to play it off and say &#34;oh I got the vaccine and passed out&#34;. He knew himself and knew what it&#39;s like to faint and this experience just felt different. He believed he had a reaction. He never felt tunnel vision that strong in his entire life, it felt like being punched in the face. Since those 2-3 weeks, his stress load had gone down and he had had a drastic change in his diet, so his blood pressure was reading much better now. This past Monday, 17May2021, when he received his vaccine, his blood pressure shouldn&#39;t have been that high.  The EMT&#39;s did come before he left and because he passed out his blood pressure was low at 100/60. When providing the Lot number off of his vaccine record card, the patient explained the last digit was either a 7 or a 2, he can&#39;t read this person&#39;s handwriting&#34;, however, he eventually confirmed the number was a 7.  The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The outcome of event tired was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovered in May2021.

He reported having lunch with his friends but could not stand and needed help walking to his car, could not walk on his own. I asked if he has any history of back pain or a similar situation and he denied any previous experience similar to this. I advised patient to contact his doctor as soon as possible for observation.

Felt as I was going to pass out. Made it to bathroom as I thought I was going to vomit. Essentially collapsed on floor and had severe rigors/uncontrollable shaking throughout entire body for 30 minutes. Felt as I was being electrocuted, it was extremely intense and could feel it through every part of my body. Teeth were clenched entire time and could barely open mouth. Attempted to get up multiple times but could not make it past getting on my knees. Laid on floor  until shaking eventually subsided. Had severe headache after (i assume it was from clenching teeth for 30 min). Extreme fatigue.  Was sent to ER per policy for covid test - results negative. Sent home from work per policy. Slept remainder of day. Woke up @ 5 pm feeling substantially better.

                                                Severe cervical spine pain and stiffness with paresthesias in bilateral arms and weakness in right tricep and scapula. Took OTC acetaminophen and NDAIDs. Visited employees health who sent me to urgent care for neurological exam. Urgent care physician noted right arm weaker than left and recorded report of bilateral upper extremity paresthesia. Recommended follow up exam and cervical MRI if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within 7 days. Neck pain has improved but still present. Paresthesias still present. Right arm (dominant arm) still weaker than left. Will follow up with primary care physician this week if symptoms continue.  Additional side effects: headache, dizziness, nausea, shivers, fatigue, joint pain (all resolved within 72 hours).

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

                                                24 hr after vaccine, I had fatigue and generalized body aches and left arm pain at site of injection. I took tylenol.  Those stopped by the second day morning (day after vaccine). However, in the second morning ( day after vaccine) I started having pain on left side of neck and on Trapezius muscle on left shoulder blade - and had that pain for three more days. Range of motion for neck restricted for three days. All symptoms improved after four days. I took Lidocaine patch and Tylenol for neck and shoulder blade pain.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I got very lightheaded and my heart started pounding. There were a few moments during the first half hour of receiving the shot that I thought I might pass out. When the nurse took my blood pressure it was 184/81, which is not normal for me. It took about an hour for it to get back down to a normal level. Afterwards, I felt very jittery for a while.

A customer yelled for help and pharmacy staff and the nurse practitioner responded to help. Pt. was passed out but breathing heavily.  We rolled patient to his back and he came to and tried to get up.  We told him to stay flat and assured him he was being taken care of.  The nurse practitioner stated it was a vagal nerve response.  The patient sat up and talked with us and stated this has happened before.   The ambulance response was called and checked patient out and he was released about 30 minutes later.

Was wondering if any OTC (advil,tylenol,etc) was recommended for the light head. If not I&#39;ll probably be fine in a day, just reporting in and hoping to speed this along. I&#39;ll probably just go to sleep for the day and if anything gets worse I&#39;ll submit another report. The time is 2:50 pm. Thanks for the hard work everybody. Have a nice day.

                                                Patient told me that he gets dizzy after immunizations. I told him that I would keep him seated after until he felt ok, his wife was with him and I told her that if he started feeling bad to let me know as I went back into the pharmacy.  About 5 minutes after his immunization he said he didn&#39;t feel well.  I went out to check on him he said he was hot  and then he lost consciousness.  His wife and I were not able to wake him,  911 was called and  I grabbed the Epipen 0.3mg and gave him 1 dose in the left thigh.  Shortly after he started to respond.  Once awake he began vomiting and still complained of being very hot.  His wife splashed water on his face and we kept talking to him until EMS arrived about 5 minutes after the Call.  EMS  checked him out, he refused to go to the hospital and refused them to take him to his car when he felt better.  He walked out on his own after about another 20 minutes with his wife.  I called to check on his around 4pm and he said that he was feeling ok.

                                                According to my wife, 10 minutes post shot I had what appeared to be a mild seizure and lost consciousness for 1-2 minutes. Prior to that happening, I told her I felt light headed. She notified personnel while we were in the 15 min wait holding area and when I regained consciousness two EMTs were checking me out. They took my vitals, asked me questions and had me get out of the car and walk around. I was monitored for several minutes. It was recommended I visit a hospital or urgent care if I continued to feel unwell. My wife &amp; I left the vaccine site and decided on the way home to go to the hospital just to ensure everything was all right. We went back home for about 30-60 minutes. During this time my heart rate continued to remain elevated and it felt like I had adrenaline coursing through my system. I attributed the feeling to recovering from passing out, but it did not dissipate.  Upon arrival to the ER I began having trouble trying to breathe and chest pain. During the triage EKG it was discovered I was experiencing atrial fibrillation. I was given treatment, fluids and monitored for several hours before being released. Estimated time from receiving shot to being diagnosed with afib was approximately 2.5-3 hours.

                                                Roughly 5 minutes after vaccination patient said he started to feel lightheaded, patient started to pass out but we got him to a laying flat position fast enough that I&#39;m not sure if he fully passed out. Patient immediately could verify his name, DOB, what just happened etc. Declined any symptoms that would indicate any form of allergic reaction. Said he felt dizzy/lightheaded/sweaty. Sat patient up after a couple minutes and took a blood pressure. It read 103/52. Patient then informed me he does pass out after shots. He says he doesn&#39;t get vaccines because of his fear of needles but in the past when he had a shot for a medication he has passed out. Took another blood pressure about 10 minutes later which read 126/86. Patient also informed me he hadn&#39;t ate/drank anything all day and did work all day prior. Got patient a pop to help with any low blood sugar. Patient had a friend pick him up, didn&#39;t want an ambulance, said he felt fine after 30ish minutes passed by besides a minor headache.

                                                started as severe dizziness and weakness, chest pain was hospitalized once I got to the ER because my heart was not working properly, after many test the found my heart was in heart failure with an output of 35% only, was in hospital for 5 days. Doctors couldn&#39;t see what caused such a sudden weakness of the heart, they did cardio path and arteries have zero blockage, they did ECO, and a EP Study. My heart now suffers from PVCs or arrhythmia and they are very irregular and frequent. Was given medicine to help the heart and control the PVCs, and discharged with wearing a safety vest, to follow up with the cardio doctors. Followed up with doctors and they have done an MRI which shows scarring of the heart. The doctor has determined that the diagnosis is myocardiatis. There is no proof this direct relation with the vaccine,  however symptoms started soon after the vaccine in a healthy young man. Now I still have to go to another electrophysiologist to see what he can do to help alleviate the PVCs and continue to take the medication to see of the heart can improve. I could not work for a month, and still cannot resume normal activities because my heart is to weak to sustain it.

                                                I have experienced a light headed feeling ever since I got the first Covid dose of the Pfizer brand.  I did have a very brief dizzy spell about 25 minutes after I received the vaccine but that disappeared then and never returned.  I have contacted my PCP about the light headed feeling and I think they may be trying to look into it further because it did not go away in a few days after the shot.  They told me if it changes to dizziness to definately contact them back.  It hasn&#39;t become dizziness yet.  The light headed feeling comes and goes at times but it always seems to come back and I still have it today.  Due to the light headed feeling I did check my blood pressure and blood sugar levels and they were both in the normal healthy range that I have always had.  I also experienced flu like symptoms as a side effect for 4 or 5 days after the shot as well as fatigue.  Also the one night after the vaccination I had a very brief epsiode of a thumping heart beat but that didn&#39;t last very long.  I have never experienced the heart rate thing before either.

                                                Patient had fainted after receiving the vaccine and when I came to saw him, he was back on the chair. He said he felt faint. I asked if his breathing was alright, his sight and hearing was ok; he said everything was fine, but he still felt faint. Then I saw his eyes closing again and he slouched down on the chair and became unconscious. I helped him onto the ground, where he started shaking, so I rolled him onto his side. He felt clammy. It was a few seconds before he stopped shaking and opened his eyes again. I asked him to stay laying on the ground and asked him again regarding his breathing, hear rate, vision, how he felt. He asked if he passed out again and I told him yes and we&#39;re going to keep him on the ground until paramedics arrive. He said he felt better; his breathing and speech was fine, there wasn&#39;t any sound of shortness of breath, but he was sweating in cold sweats and he asked us to fan him. He said that he felt better and that he has a big phobia of needles, which his wife who was there, confirmed. He informed me that he&#39;s fainted several times at doctor&#39;s office and hospitals when they stick a needle in him. When the fire fighters arrived, they spoke to him prepared to get a EKG on him, to which he immediately told them that he doesn&#39;t want them to stick any needles in him and he became frightened that the EKG pads were needles. When paramedics came, they determined that they had to take him to the hospital because they said he wasn&#39;t able to stand up on his own without falling over and his heart rate was increasing.

                                                Three - four hours after my second dose I began to feel dizzy, fluttering in my chest, and short of breath. I sat down to try to catch my breath and decided to put my heart rate monitor on (I use it when I run). My heart rate would dip into the 40s when I normally have a resting heart rate in the mid 60s.  After 30 minutes of sitting and the symptoms getting progressively worse, I decided to go to the emergency room. On the way over I started feeling weak and increasingly short of breath.  These symptoms lasted for approximately 8 hours. Since the episode I have noticed periodic episodes of shortness of breath and chest fluttering.

                                                My first COVID19 Pfizer vaccine shot was on 4/05/21. My second was 3 weeks later on 4/26/21.  About 30 hours after my second vaccine on 4/27/21 I started to notice tightness around my lungs/rib cage in the intercostal muscle area. For the next few days the pain increased and I had shortness of breath as well. After a few nights I couldn&#39;t lie down to sleep because of this pain so I had to sit upright to sleep.   On 5/3/21 I went to the doctor at hospital where I was examined and had a lung X-ray as well as a COVID PCR test (it was negative). The PA diagnosed me with &#34;Pneumonia&#34; and I was given antibiotics (cefuroxime and azithromycin) to take for 6-7 days.  I started feeling a little better by 5/6/21 and actually reported here on VAERS with my diagnosis of suspected Pneumonia. On 5/17/21 I had another lung x-ray at hospital and was told my lungs were looking more clear. However, for the next 2 weeks I felt more tired and my poor breathing, a cough with bloody mucus, and more chest/rib cage area pain developed. Despite being a professional runner it became hard to walk up a flight of stairs without breathing really hard and feeling light-headed.   On  5/30/21 I woke up with fairly intense chest pain just under my heart. I was taken to the ER at second Hospital and got a CT scan with contrast that showed a bilateral Pulmonary Embolism with infract. An ultra sound of my heart (normal) and blood panels were performed as well as multiple EKGs. I was given a stomach injection of Lovenox also. That afternoon I was transferred to third Hospital. for overnight monitoring with more EKGs and Lovenox injections. Prescribed blood thinner Pradaxa for 3 months with no known cause of clots that caused this Pulmonary Embolism. Kidney test and Heart appeared normal. Still waiting on genetic testing. Lung infract has caused lasting chest pain and my breathing has yet to return back to normal.

Upon checking vitals was tachycardic with heart rate in 120s; drop in blood pressure to 100/50 (my baseline is 120/75).  No wheezing. No stridor. Oxygen saturations 99%. No hives or rash. No facial or peripheral swelling.  Provided fluids (by mouth), cold compresses, and benadryl. Gradual improvement after this.  Majority of symptoms lasted for approx 1 to 1.5 hours; with some waxing/waning palpitations for another~1 hour.  I have no prior history of similar symptoms after receiving vaccines or medications in the past.

Began to feel flu like symptoms approx 1800 on the evening of 1/19/21. Symptoms worsened through the night rapidly, beginning with uncontrollable chills/shivering, body aches, restless, slight vertigo, weakness/fatigue. At approx 0100 the morning of 1/20/21, blacked out while in the bathroom of which awoken and found myself disoriented, weak, and on the ground (no injuries noted as i must have eased myself down).  I was able to hydrate afterwards and tolerate eating some dry cereal to help with the weakness. Symptoms began to dissipate while an intense headache continued throughout the night and even through the daytime. The time is now 1020 on the day of 1/20/21 and i still have quite the headache but all other symptoms seem to be relieved at this time.

Couldn&#39;t abduct arm for about 24 hours due to pain.  Very faint red rash a few inches below injection site that goes across arm.  Arm is moderately itchy and has been since Monday 1/18/21.  Arm feels tight and is still pretty sore when reaching out and stretching it above my head.   No redness, itchiness, or discomfort around injection site.  Everything is in the middle of the upper arm.  The itchiness and prolonged soreness are my concerns, considering I still need a 2nd dose.

I want to go to bed at 1900 nightly and that was never my normal.

                                                Was administered the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in our drive-thru clinic on 3/4/21 at approximately 2:15pm. Was in the driver&#39;s seat of his SUV with his father in the passenger seat. Nothing in the PQCF gave us any reason to be concerned over this particular administration. After administration, was asked to pull forward and park in a spot on the right in order to sit for his required 15 minutes post-administration. became unresponsive as he was attempting to park and continue to turn the wheel causing him to drive in a U shape into a rock covered median. The SUV was able to clear the median and the car stopped at the APEX. When I saw the car heading towards the median, I started to head toward the site safely. I approached the car slowly asking him to stop. When I did not receive a response, I knew something was wrong. Once I felt the car was safe to approach, I ran to assist the patient. The patient was barely able to communicate but did say he was dizzy.  15 seconds later he was unable to communicate, I called a second pharmacist  to run over with an epi pen just in case (this was NOT administered). I immediately called 911 at 2:21 pm. reached into the vehicle and got the vehicle into park, while I assessed his airway, breathing, and pulse from a seated position. The patient began to seize. I continued to hold the patient from outside of the vehicle to maintain the patient&#39;s airway and keep him from hurting himself on the steering wheel. The patient regained consciousness approximately 3 minutes later with no memory of what happened. EMS arrived on scene about 2 minutes after he regained the ability to communicate. While EMS assessed the patient, and I reached out to  and division one store management per SOP. EMS determined that the patient had a seizure and was able to go home if they wanted. The father moved into the driver seat. We monitored the patient for 30 minutes and allowed them to leave. We followed up with the patient via phone 2 hours later with no concerns noted. No property damage or bodily harm occurred during this incident. If we are given approval to vaccinate this patient with a second dose, we will arrange for this patient to be taken care of in the pharmacy.

                                                Pt received the covid vaccine around 12:50 pm.  Then as he was walking to schedule his second appointment soon after the vaccine, he fell to his knees (no CHI).  I was notified and ran over to see pt was disoriented, pale, diaphoretic.  While measuring his left arm BP (80/30), he began to convulse with both elbows flexed.  The convulsions lasted about 10 secs, pt did not recall the event, we held him in a seated position on the floor.  He felt much better after the convulsion &#43; water/snacks, however we did call EMS during the event.  Per EMS, BP was 128/80, and pt was AAOx3.  Pt refused to go to the hospital and agreed to f/up with PCP.

Had mild headache and mild arm ache which went away after 2 days, no fever, site redness, no chills. It has now been 10 days and I still have tingling and weakness mainly in hands and feet but sometimes it spreads to calfs, thighs, and arms. It feels like the beginning stages of a charlie horse about 25% of the time and I am getting 1 to 2 charlie horses each day.

Later my face and top of my head and upper chest flushed some and had a  headache, the headache went away on it&#39;s own relatively quickly.   The next day I felt a little rough, but I have read that the second dose has much higher side effects, and since I have a blood issue, it&#39;s concerning.

His eyes started rolling into the back of his head and he was exhibiting shallow breaths. His pupils dilated and he started foaming at the mouth. Pt was lowered to the ground and a full dose of adult epi pen (Lot#0FM406 Exp FEB 2022) was given to the left lateral thigh at 1725. 911 was also called. Pt came to almost immediately. His pupils and breathing returned to baseline. He stayed lying down but was A &amp; O x4. He confirmed that he does not have any allergies, however he has passed out after a vaccine before. Paramedics arrived on scene and took over the encounter. Pt felt much better, however still went with the Paramedics to the ER. Also advised pt to follow up with his PCP in regards to receiving the second vaccine.

                                                Experienced chest pain, neck pain, general muscle pain, joint pain, some abdominal pain, headaches, fatigue, some shortness of breath, lightheadedness, some vision change in left eye, severe heartburn flare up, nausea, digestive issues (urgent, but small stools), increased heartrate, irregular tachycardia responses and heart palpitations. The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I went to bed around 10pm feeling very cold an shivering. I was able to fall asleep, but then I woke up at 2am feeling very thirsty and experiencing intense nausea. I got out of bed to get some water. When I exited the room the nausea intensified so I knelt on the floor to wait until it passed. It didn&#39;t really pass so I stood up to try and get back to the bed. After a few steps I blacked out and fell to the floor. I was only unconscious for a few seconds, as confirmed by my wife who heard me fall. When I came to, I was lying face down and still experiencing intense nausea. I was also very hot and sweating, and very thirsty. I laid with my eyes closed an breathing very heavily to suppress the urge to vomit for a minute or two. When the urge to vomit began to subside I took a few sips of water while still lying on the ground. After another minute or two I was able to get up and get back into bed. The extreme nausea subsided after a few more minutes and I was able to drink more water. I went back to sleep after that. I woke up in the morning around 7am. I felt a little &#34;off&#34; for most of the day: slightly weak, a mild headache, with some difficulty focusing. But since then I have felt normal.   I didn&#39;t seek medical attention or take any medication. I have experienced Vasovagel Syncope as a child so I expect that I am more susceptible to fainting like in this case.

Upon assessing the patient he could not respond to questions and his eyes were glazed over. For a couple of minutes the patient was completely zoned out and could not respond. EMS was called to further evaluate the patient. After a few minutes the patient came back to and was able to respond to questions.

                                                4 days after the first shot I was feeling very very dizzy.   My ears felt full enough that I thought maybe they were just full of wax.  I bought an over the counter ear cleaning kit.  That didn&#39;t relieve any symptoms.  I never get headaches, but a couple days later the front top of my head was throbbing.  The area just above my forehead.  It was not sinus pressure, my face didn&#39;t feel any pressure or pain.  My throat also felt like I was being slightly choked.  Not my airway, but just my jugulars.  It began in the evenings.  It would feel like I had been hanging upside down for a while.  My head felt full of blood, like it was going to pop, like my eyes were bugging out.  By a week to 10 days later, my upper arms felt weak, my toes were tingling, and my heart would flutter for just a few seconds occasionally.  I was still dizzy, still felt like I was choking, except I was feeling this way all the time now.  The symptoms only seemed to be staying the same or getting worse.  I have NEVER gone to the doctor on my own in my life to get something checked, but this had me disconcerted enough to check in and see if I should get my second shot at all.  My appointment was to see my doctor was the morning of the same day I was scheduled to get my second Pfizer shot.  My doctor had not heard of these symptoms being associated with the Pfizer shot and chalked my symptoms up to stress.  I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of &#34;waiting to see what happens&#34; if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.  But I accepted the explanation and took the second shot that day anyway.  It should be noted that the second shot made my left armpit swell up quite a bit.  I did feel dizzy again, but not nearly as much.  The other symptoms seemed to not be as bad either.

Patient reports dizzy spells over the past few days with shortness of breath and then last evening developed a diffuse rash over his chest and extremities associated with itching and burning sensation on 5/1 evening. He denies any nausea,vomiting,abdominal pain,diarrhea.No chest pain or cough.Denies headaches.Denies h/o of prior allergic reaction/concerns to the first dose of the vaccine or any other vaccine.Denies any new exposure other than as stated the 2nd dose of the covid vaccine. Treated with IV steroids, IV Pepcid, and IV Benadryl with improvement. Upon discharge, directed to continue Prednsione 40mg daily for three more days for a total of five days of steroids, and follow-up with PCP. SUBSEQUENTLY, returned to ER  acute onset of decreased visual acuity, diffuse arthralgias, joint pain, myalgias, lightheadedness, palpitations, vertigo, muscle spasms, and difficulty moving both upper extremities. This was accompanied by sharp, 10 out of 10, nonradiating, diffuse anterior chest pressure. Nothing made this better or worse. The patient was driving at that time, and was unable to control his arms, which resulted in his vehicle leaving the roadway.  He was able to bring the vehicle to a stop before crashing. Since then, his symptoms have gradually improved, although they have not completely resolved. The characteristics are identical to the events that led to his previous admission.

                                                Very mild arm soreness at injection site for 1-2 days, but otherwise no notable side effects until 5 days later: dizziness. First night, it was very difficult to sleep - I did not get much. Dizziness was like being very drunk. Now every night laying down in bed looking up is dizzying, some nights worse than others but not as bad as first night of symptoms. This has been persistent for about a week. Some temporary dizziness when reorienting head quickly during the day, particularly looking up or down, but mainly worse at night in the dark, not debilitating. Sleeping with some low lights on helps reduce spinning feeling. Mild headache and tight neck/shoulders starting 9 days after injection but may be unrelated.

                                                Around 2 weeks after receiving the first vaccine dose, I woke in the middle of the night gasping for air. My heart was racing and I was so weak that I could barely sit up. The following day I could not get out of bed. I also had an intense headache, which is unusual for me since I never get headaches. On the 3rd day I developed dizziness/vertigo. Since those events occurred, I&#39;ve been dizzy 24/7 and had about 25-50% of my normal energy. I cannot drive, I cannot work, I cannot many of my normal daily activities. This has been devastating. It has been over 3 weeks now with these symptoms, and I will probably lose my job this week. I don&#39;t know where to turn. There should have been a safety net for these things.

Patient arrived alert and oriented x3, answered &#34;no&#34; to all screening questions, and revealed to nurse that he had a fear of needles. Nurse then offered to vaccinate patient in the zero gravity chair, patient refused stating that it would be embarassing. Patient also stated if he looked away from the needle, he would be fine. Patient received the vaccine in his left arm, nurse directed patient to sit in the front of the observation area by the EMT table, patient agreed. Patient was alert and oriented when leaving vaccine station #3. When patient made his way to the front of the EMT station to have a seat, he ended up falling at 1459. It is unclear if he loss consciousness and then fell or fell then loss consciousness. Lead RN was then alerted at 1500 by the lead ancillary, , who I ) instructed to call EMS. The recorded time of the EMS phone call is 1501. While waiting for EMS, I  attempted to rouse patient by calling his name and rubbing his sternum for several minutes and obtained a set of vitals. Vitals are as followed: BP: 119/76, O2: 100%, P: 59 taken at 1502. Patient exhibited eye movements when name was called repetitively and then patient opened his eyes at 1504 stating &#34;Somebody just hit me&#34;, while attempting to gesture to the juncture where his neck met his skull. While patient was alert, he was oriented x1. Patient could not remember where he was, what had happened, or what day it was. Patient only remembered first and last name but could not remember his age. While speaking to patient, patient loss consciouness for a second time at 1505. Another set of vitals were obtained at 1506, BP: 104/80. After getting a reading of the blood pressure, patient suddently roused at 1508 and began erratically moving his arms and legs, attempting to stand while yelling out &#34;Somebody just hit me! Get off me! Who are you?!&#34; Patient insisted on getting up, RN  and I  assisted patient to transfer into the zero-gravity chair. EMS arrived at 1510 and assumed care of patient. Patient was continually yelling during EMS assessment. EMS left with patient at 1515, hospital ER unknown.

A 36-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0151) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 06Apr2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6205) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm from 16Mar2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not diagnose with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was very sick for 4 days: fevers which came and went, chills, sweats, nausea, loss of appetite, light headedness, lack of energy. As a result of his immune system being weakened, he wound up with Cellulitis which he was still fighting over 3 weeks after the shot. As the patient was normally a healthy male, it was strange that he would wind up with a bacterial infection. The patient also stated that after the second dose he experienced cellulitis in his left leg to thigh area. He went to emergency room for scan and to rule out clot. He thought he was immunocompromised and that was why he got the cellulitis in the leg. Caller wanted to get the compensation information to help with the bills. The events onset date was 06Apr2021 17:00. 2 rounds of antibiotics was received for the events. The events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included ultrasound with unknown result. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                I woke up before normal time to go to the bathroom at about 5:00AM. Part of the way through urination, I started experiencing dizziness, which didn&#39;t feel abnormal for having got out of bed/upright quickly. By the end of urination, the dizziness had come to an uncomfortable level, and faintness began to set in. I leaned on the sink to hold my body up, before trying to return to bed. I blacked out (probably very briefly) and resumed consciousness when my face hit the bathroom  door as I fell. I was almost immediately fully aware of my surroundings and what had happened after I resumed consciousness. Although I felt no further symptoms, I remained on the floor on my back for 3-5 mins before getting up and back to bed. Other than soreness at the injection site, which is gone this morning (May 15), no additional symptoms returned.

                                                After each of the two shots, I experienced severe abdominal cramping and aggressively vacating diarrhea, unlike anything I&#39;m used to in my day-to-day life. First I felt a few sharp pangs in my gut, and thought nothing of it. I then needed to spend an extended amount of time in the bathroom, surprising my poor partner who was mid-shower.   I began to feel nausea and worried I was going to throw up, the first time, and at one moment in the steamed bathroom I noticed that my vision started to cloud and fade, as if I was about to pass out, which isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve experienced either.  It passed rather quickly, and partner believed it was food poisoning so I didn&#39;t report it. Then it happened again.  Each time it occurred I *think* about 30 hours after getting the vaccine, so when I already thought I was turning a corner on the faux-flu-like   symptoms I was feeling  from the vaccine.    It was still worth it, to get my shots, but I thought I should contribute my tally mark to &#34;crippling, sudden, and cruel diarrhea&#34; to the list of side effects since I haven&#39;t heard others really talk about it.

                                                On  04/26/2021 felt short breathlessness and dizziness. also Blood pressure is elevated and in between 150-160. Heart rate was also high. Immediately went to ER to check. Was treated for palpitation and dehydration. Felt normal after couple of days.  I took second dose on 05/06/2021. I felt normal for about a week. After that i started feeling heavy or pressure in my head and also dizziness. For past one week I&#39;m feeling acid reflux and heartburn. Considering i had history of acid reflux I never had this issue for past few years. I&#39;m not sure if my GERD issues are induced by vaccine. I&#39;m having controlled diet with fruits and veggies but i still have  heartburn and frequent burps. Also my Blood Pressure is still elevated around 130-140 and feeling tired and pressure in my head even now after  18 days of taking 2nd dose. I had consulted my physician on 05/20/2021, and she prescribed a medicine to take only when my blood pressure is above 140.   Just to summarize, I still have dizziness and occasionally elevated BP and acid reflux, heartburn/burps. This is impacting my day to day home and office works

                                                Patient received the shot at approximately 2:00pm. He was visibly anxious while waiting for the shot and receiving it, as he verbalized he was afraid of needles. After giving the shot and sitting for about 5 minutes, he stated he was feeling a little bit light headed and nauseous. At this time, I pulled up next to him and talked about symptoms. There was slight nausea and felt a little &#34;out of sorts.&#34; Due to the nausea, gave a dose of benadryl in order to help with the nausea, sweats, and nervousness. 9-1-1 was called during benadryl administration. Within 5 minutes, the patient began to talk about his throat being itchy, and when about to administer epinephrine the paramedics arrived and took over, and left in an ambulance. Ultimately after discharge from the hospital, the patient did not receive Epinephrine either from our clinic or from the hospital.

                                                EE reports he received pfizer vaccine on 1/21/21.  He noted extreme fatigue on 1/22/21 and today 1/23/21 noted an inability to form words and talk while on the phone, dizzy, tongue is half numb, and notes sweating.   EE advised to f/u with ER for assessment.  Consult with Dr.  e-mail was sent alerting her to this reaction.  MAJ follow up on 1/26:  ED record reviewed.  EE had vaccine injected on 1/21 and experienced chills and nausea on 1/22.  On 1/23 he had 1-2 minutes of aphasia and R jaw numbness.  ED evaluation that afternoon revealed a well-appearing adult with normal vital signs and neurologic exam.  Assessment by ED physician was that this was not a stroke or transient ischemic attack but might be a vaccine-related adverse event.  The ee was referred for follow-up with his PCP, Dr. , who can be emailed if further follow up information is needed.  I suspect the ee became dehydrated from vaccine-related nausea and that this was the cause of his transient neurologic symptoms.

A 37-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date: unknown), via intramuscular route on his right arm on 16Dec2020 15:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient had no known allergies and had no COVID prior vaccination. There were no concomitant medications. On 24Dec2020 at 19:00 (reported as 8 days after vaccine), the patient experienced severe vertigo and nystagmus. Presumed diagnosis vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis. It has now been one month since onset of symptoms. Much improved but still some persistent vertigo. The reporter was thinking that the events were unlikely to be due to COVID-19 vaccine but given uncertainty of etiology, he thought he should report it. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab and polymerase chain reaction (PCR): negative on 02Jan2021. The patient had no prior vaccination.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

                                                Well I?m alive. It started about 45 minutes after taking the vaccine. It began as heavy salivating and turned into a numb tongue. I have never had an allergic reaction, so didn?t pay much attention to it. After returning home I became severely lightheaded and almost passed out. I immediately took a Benadryl and Motrin. Then my heart rate shot up to 160BPM according to my smart watch and maintained that for around 5 minutes. The home medicine helped it to subside, but the same feelings would return in moderate waves. By 2pm, I decided I should seek professional help and was taken to the ER by a family member. By this time I had moderate chest and jaw was very tight. At the ER I was monitored for 1 hour and then given an IV injection of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron(steroid). I immediately get relived and well. I was released from the ER around an hour later and sent home with a prescription of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone Oral Steroid. I have since had a few different side effects like chest pain, extremely flushed face, and low grade fevers. The medicine taken at home immediately stopped the face flushing.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EL9267) on 26Feb2021 and the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EN6202) on 12Mar2021, via an unspecified route of administration on Left Arm at single  dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The administration of first dose of BNT162B2 resulted in Palpitations, dizziness, hyperhidrosis and Syncope the same day of administration. Relevant medical history included allergy to penicillin.  Relevant concomitant medications included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE). During second dose of vaccine the patient stated that he feels the medicine in his body, almost to his toes. The patient was fine for a minute or two but then he reported a big rush of the room spinning, struggling to catch my breath, racing heart. EMS personnel was called over and they monitored my heart rate. It was swinging from 120&#43; BPM to 50 BPM in an instant and during the low BPM was when he passed out.   The patient was treated with Epinephrine due a potential reaction and transported to hospital.  The reported events were feeling abnormal, vertigo, dyspnoea, palpitations, heart rate irregular and loss of consciousness. All events were serious as hospitalization and Life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine, I had some minor arm soreness, which went away. I experienced no other adverse effects until the morning of March 21, when I woke up with a significant feeling of disequilibrium. I had never experienced something like this before; when I was stationary I felt fine, but when I started to move my sense of balance was noticeably off. I stumbled around my apartment for a bit before heading to Urgent Care, where I was diagnosed with Benign Positional Vertigo.

                                                Only symptom experienced during first ~36 hours after receiving vaccine was soreness near injection area of left arm.   A couple hours after falling as sleep the second night after vaccination shot (Sunday night), I woke up very cold / severe shivering. After several hours I managed to fall asleep for approximately another 1-2 hours. The next day I experienced fever, shivers, general body weakness/fatigue, and muscle aches/discomfort especially in both legs. These symptoms lasted throughout the day.  That night (Monday night), when I got into bed, I was strongly shivering. I managed to fall asleep for 1-2 hours, but woke up uncomfortably warm. I was unable to fall back asleep until 4-5 hours later. I woke up 1-2 hours later, with most of my body dripping with sweat, and the sheets rather damp.  Tuesday and Wednesday: Symptoms came and went, mostly feelings of fever, chills, general fatigue, lost appetite, and mild light headedness. Sleeping remained difficult, able to stay asleep for &lt;4 hours each night.    As of today (Thursday), fever has subsided. Still generally feel fatigued, occasionally lightheaded.

Within 5-6 minutes of leaving the room, pt presented with pallor, sweating, dizziness, light-headedness.  We gave him a bottle of cold water to drink and a cold rag and an ice pack to use on his neck. We checked in with him every 3-4 minutes to make sure he was still doing ok and starting to feel better. After about 15-20 minutes, the color began to come back in his face and the sweating and dizziness subsided. He contacted his wife (he has a history of this type of reaction) and she came to pick him up about 27 minutes after the administration of the vaccine.  He walked out of our store on his own without help.

Had to diarrhea over 30 times in one day, throw up several times. Went to emergency room for treatment. IV treatment plus anti naseau and anti cramping   Medication. Cramping was severe in upper intestine. Symptoms have decreased, but still linger after 2 weeks of 2nd shot.  Concern if side effects are permeant. I still very tired/fatigued,  have cramping, dirahaha, throwing up, aches muscles and joints- not feeling like myself and regret taking the vaccine if it results in lifelong side effects.

I approached him and asked if he was alright and gently tapped his shoulder. He did not respond. I spoke louder, he did not respond. I shook his shoulder and spoke very loudly, he opened his eyes and rolled his head around and told me that he felt really dizzy. His skin was warm and he was sweating. He reported that he was breathing fine, that he just felt dizzy and hot. Over the next 5 minutes his dizziness decreased. He reported that the site of vaccination felt numb. Vaccination site did not show any redness or signs of local reaction. He reported that he was still breathing fine. His dizziness continued to decrease, and 25 minutes after the vaccine he reported that he did not feel dizzy anymore.  He asked for some water, which I gave him. He stayed sitting in the chair until an hour after the vaccine. He got up and walked around and reported feeling no more dizziness and that he felt fine driving home.

Monday night ~10:00 p.m.: random, mild pain in chest; feels like a needle is poking into my heart. More wiped out than usual, go to bed 1-2 hours earlier than normal. Monday night-Tuesday morning, ~12 hours after shot: ~1:40 a.m. Wake up with chills &amp; apparent fever; didn&#39;t have thermometer ~2:02 a.m. Nausea quickly turns to vomiting. Headache begins. ~3:30 a.m. 2nd round of vomiting. Dry heaves. Muscle contractions are longer &amp; more severe than typical for me. ***Unable to sleep much. Fever apparently breaks. Headache, overall fatigue.*** ~7:30 a.m. 3rd round of vomiting. Dry heaves. Muscle contractions are longer &amp; more severe than typical for me. ~10:00-10:30 a.m. Drive to pharmacy; buy thermometer and aspirin. Thermometer reads 97.4º, then 96.7º, so the fever is long gone. ~11:00-12:30 p.m. Take one tablet (81 mg) of aspirin every 30 minutes with a couple of ounces of water. That&#39;s all the water I can drink. ~12:40 p.m. 4th round of vomiting; lost the water. Muscle contractions wouldn&#39;t stop; I felt dizzy at the end. ~2:10 p.m. Wake up feeling slightly better; last 30 minutes on the computer for work. Go back to sleep. ~4:15 p.m. Wake up feeling much better; last ~1 hour on the computer. ~10:00 p.m. start eating again. First time in 24 hours.

I have been forgetting a lot of things I don?t normally forget. The feelings are starting to make me feel depressed.  I had a couple of good days that made me feel like I was coming out of it. Then the next day would have me back to square one.  I feel like I?m constantly high from marajuana.  I find myself just staring at a wall and completely forgetting what just happened. Everything?s seems unreal.  I had dizzy spells that have subsided since the beginning.

                                                Shortly after the shot which was painless to take, I felt soreness in my arm and stiffness in my neck and for about 1 min about 10 min after the shot my vision went slightly fuzzy and got slightly light headed but passed very quickly but I did feel flushed for about 30 min after. A few hours after though a fuzzy feeling over my head returned, my stomach was slightly nauseated, and had a slight fever.  This did not really go away before I went to bed for the night. My shot was about 1:15 PM EST this was noticed about 4-5 pm starting and lasting until bed. Around 4:00 Am I woke and my stomach was very nauseated to feeling like I would puke but I was able to go back to sleep. When I woke my left arm felt very sore, my stomach the rest of the day until sometime the next morning around 6 am was unsettled. No issues using the restroom. But the fuzzy headache had persisted but by the end of the night I had a very front sided top of the head headache that radiated to my neck off and on. Swallowing water hurt, lights were becoming slightly painful.  As well as my jaw ached a bit. I went to bed and throughout the night woke to a headache of the same nature but at time with a pulsing pain. Sometime around 6 am it did stop for the most part as well as my fever broke. When I got up for the morning and throughout the day now it being around 5:30 pm my stomach had stopped for the most part with the unsettled feeling, my headache for the most part disappeared but I still have this slight felling of something fuzzy laying on top of the front part of my brain.  It not a feeling of being on top of the head but actually a feeling on the brain.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm, at the age of 37 years, on Apr2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included brain tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. On 09Apr2021, the patient stated, &#34;I am undergoing immunotherapy treatment for a brain tumor. My doctors recommended I take the vaccine 2 weeks following my most recent treatment (administered every 4 weeks). Several hours after receiving the vaccine, the right side of my body was very weak and my balance was off. These symptoms went away by the next morning. 5 days later they came back and progressed. Ultimately, I went to the emergency room having trouble walking, using my right arm and staying balanced. All tests (MRIs, ultrasound, CT scan, extensive bloodwork, and more) proved that there were no apparent causes. Ultimately, it was concluded that I had a stroke and the vaccine was likely the main contributor. I am 37, in shape, and eat extremely well.&#34;  The patient was hospitalized for the events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: there were no apparent causes, computerised tomogram: there were no apparent causes, magnetic resonance imaging: there were no apparent causes, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 15Apr2021 and ultrasound scan: there were no apparent causes on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures (Aspirin prescription, Castor, physical therapy) were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

I still don&#39;t feel the same since being vaccinated. I feel fatigued all the time,I have edema, and suffer with chronic headaches.

A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

A 37-years-old (current age of 37-38 when the reported events began) male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0I58; expiration: not reported), intramuscular, administered in arm right on 12Apr2021 16:00 as single for Covid-19 immunisation/covid precautions, not wanting to get covid at pharmacy or drug store. The patient medical history was none. Concomitant medication(s) included vortioxetine hydrobromide (TRINTELLIX; received within 2 weeks of vaccination). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no other prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine), no relevant family medical history. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and since the vaccination. No other products and no investigation assessment. On 13Apr2021, the patient had headache, sensitivity to light, was feeling lethargic, balance was off, fatigue, and hypersomnia. The headache and vision impairment (start date: 13Apr2021) were ongoing and began the very next day after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and at first the headache was very severe and now was just different and his headache kind of moved around and was always constant and persistent and got better and then boom it came back. The patient had been a little lethargic (start date: 13Apr2021) and that began the same day as the headache and vision impairment which was the very next day after the 1st dose of the vaccine. Dizziness (start date: 13Apr2021) began the very next day after the vaccine and was almost like an imbalance of whenever he was walking, he noticed he was kind of not walking a straight line almost and was going left and right trying to stay in balance (start date: 13Apr2021) and this was a little bit better. After the 1st dose the patient was getting a little concerned right now because he got the vaccine about three weeks ago and ever since he had been having severe chronic headaches and vision impairment that was ongoing and began the very next day after the 1st dose of the vaccine; the patient was a little lethargic, kind of had dizziness off and on and went to his PCP, had an MRI, and was sent to a neurologist. The patient was taking Advil, Motrin and Tylenol that were not helping his migraines (start date: unspecified) and nothing from the bunch of medications the neurologist gave him were working to help and stated Nurtec ODT (lot 3990840, expiry date Oct2022 and NDC 72618-3001-1) 75mg once daily and Nortriptyline 10mg (orange pharmacy bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC) supposed to be one capsule the 1st week and then two capsules after that by mouth. Motrin, Advil and Tylenol (no lot numbers, expiry dates or UPC numbers to provide because he ran out of those and threw the bottles away when he was done and has been meaning to get more but has not). Unspecified medicines, Toradol IV were given as therapeutic measure. The patient was not sure about the dates regarding his MRI (MRI was maybe a week and a half after this all started and then maybe a week after that he saw the neurologist). Headaches kept him up to night also and the patient had been to neurology, ophthalmology consultation, and received an MRI. The adverse events resulted in disability or permanent. The patient had not been able to work or drive since being vaccinated. The patient had no further treatment and had not gone to the ER but was under advisement that he was to go to the ER, but he could not afford to go to the ER. The patient had not had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine yet and his PCP and neurologist both agree that he would not be getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine due to the reactions he has had. The patient was calling to see if Pfizer offered help as he was without insurance and his PCP said he might need to send the patient to the hospital which might be out of the question and he was calling to see if Pfizer could help him with anything as he has not been at work for three weeks and the headache was not going away. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging with no results on unspecified date and nasal swab (sars-cov-2 test) was negative on 15Apr2021. The outcome for little lethargic/feeling lethargic was not recovered, severe chronic headaches was not recovered, sensitivity to light was not recovered, balance is off was not recovered, fatigue was not recovered, hypersomnia was not recovered, not been able to work or drive since being vaccinated was not recovered, vision impairment was not recovered, kind of has dizziness off and on was recovering and for migraine was not recovered.     Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events was considered related to suspect drug based on Compatable temporal association and known safety profile of the drug.

At the same time my right arm (opposite the injection arm) began to have muscle spasms which too passed. A wave of cold spread throughout my body and immediately my anxiety began to skyrocket (untriggered). None of these symptoms occurred after 1st dose.  Insomnia the night of both the 1st and 2nd doses.   Nearly 2.5 weeks after 2nd dose, dizziness is a daily occurrence followed by symptoms of vertigo (at times wakes me up at night). Fatigue has intensified.

A 37-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01May2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EW0176) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included multiple sclerosis and known allergies: All mammalian meats (alpha gal protein), shellfish, and tree nuts. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 01May2021 02:45 PM, within a few minutes of receiving his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the patient became slightly dizzy and a bit sick to my stomach (likely from the dizzy feeling). Since it occurred within minutes, he was assuming it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine itself. He was obviously nervous about getting his second dose now. Often times anaphylaxis occurs the 2nd time you encounter a reaction inducing stimuli. No treatment received. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome was recovered on May2021. This case was reported as not serious.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                3 Days following my second shot, I felt a horrible shock/pain through my neck and jaw that made me crouch down in pain in the middle of a busy street. I went straight to an urgent care. The provider said it was a vaccine side effect and gave me steroids to take for four days. The next week, I went back because I began to feel a pulling sensation/pain develop on the side of my face. They referred me to an ENT. I went to the ENT.  He found a vocal chord nodule and ordered a CT scan.   Before I could make the CT scan appointment, I had an episode in the shower where I began to see flashing lights and my limbs became wobbly and weak. I was very dizzy and had to hug the shower wall for support. My wife took me to the emergency room where a multitude of tests were run including a CT scan. Nothing was remarkable, but the doctor was concerned about the neurological effects, and referred me to a neurologist.  I saw the neurologist the next day, and she diagnosed me with trigeminal neuralgia on top of ordering an MRI of my brain (normal). I am taking carbamazepine and baclofen as treatment for the condition. She said it can occur virally.

Took Tylenol in the evening and took another dose at 2am. It was about 78 degrees in our house that evening, and I had a comforter and another blanket on in bed.  The chills subsided by 7am, but then my body felt like it got hit by a truck and was hard to move or get out of bed. I had to stay home and attempt to work from home, although the body weakness and headache lasted until 8pm on 4/28.  Overall, it felt like flu condensed into a 24 hour period.

He woke up his mother at 5:40, came to his mothers room and said that he was shaking, and mother noticed that he was, trembling.  She asked what was wrong and he said that he could not stop shaking and his chest was hurting.  She set him down in a chair and she got the autometer to check his BP and oxygen, and his BP was 134/98, and his 02 was 96, heart rate 86.  She felt him to see if he was having a fever, it was 98.4.  She told him to sit for a little while and waited about 10 minutes, she checked his BP again at 6:00 AM, and it was 139/102, he said that he was feeling really dizzy, his head started hurting real bad.  He said that he had a bad taste in his mouth.  She just monitored him, and his 02 was still 96, heart rate was still good.  He stayed in her room until 6:15 and she got up and told him if he got worse she would take him to the ER.  At 6:25 she gave him two 500 mg of Tylenol tablets and sat him in a recliner.  At 7:30 his head was still hurting, but he was not shaking, and she gave him some yogurt and water.  He stated that he started feeling better and around 7:40 he went back up to his room and went back to sleep.  He has been ok since then.

                                                I had my first dose of COVID vaccine on April 25, 2021. On May 6, 2021 evening around 8 PM I had a severe dizziness attack that lasted for 2 hours and intermittent vomiting for 4 times that night and my dizziness resolved spontaneously. The next morning I went to Urgent Care for further evaluation, they gave me Anti-Vertigo medicine. I felt well till next week. On the following week again I had a severe dizziness attack, profuse sweating, and vomiting. On next morning, I lost my hearing in the right ear, couldn&#39;t hear anything. And again i went to Urgent care, that time they gave me Antibiotics Amoxy-clavulanate for 10 days, after 2 days of loss of hearing, it recovered and felt well. After that, I took 2nd dose of COVID vaccine on May 19, 2021. Again on June 4, 2021 I had dizziness attack and profuse sweating along with i started feeling uncomfortable in my right ear and next morning my hearing loss again. Ever since my hearing is not recovered yet. I am extensively visiting my ENT/Otolaryngologist ever since and my doctors prescribe me steroid by mouth and injection in the ear. Till date i profoundly loss my hearing. I can&#39;t hear anything now.

A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

He took a shower and lost his balance twice in the shower because he was dizzy. He was able to make it to work. At work, he started having a headache. It started to get worse. The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol. He took two 500mg tablets again. He didn&#39;t have any energy sitting at his desk doing nothing. He was not able to look at his computer because of the headache. He could not work on 08Jan2021.

When I came back around 4pm I was feeling okay, no sore on the injection site, unlike my regularly flu vaccines that I mostly feel sore at injection site which lasts about few hours immediately after the flu shot, so it was sort of surprising to see that but later that night, my body starts feeling weak, aches and a tangling on my feet, as the night progresses up to the early morning, I was unusually fatigued and lightheaded with the regression of the muscle aches and subsequently other symptoms started disappearing, notably, I started feeling soreness on the injection site, which lingered to the next day.

                                                I passed out while sitting in the observation area shortly after receiving my shot (10-15 minutes). I was initially able to walk from the area where the injection was administered about 50 yards to the observation area. Sat down &amp; shortly thereafter could feel myself getting woozy. I laid my head back &amp; closed my eyes hoping to avoid it. I was given two epinephrine shots the second of which woke me up. Several medical staff were around me when I opened my eyes. I was taken to the patient wing and checked into my own room for observation for a few more hours. Blood was drawn and sent off for a Triptase test which came back negative a couple days later. After being kept under observation for a few hours I was release around noon. I have a history of problems with shots/needles. Haven&#39;t actually passed out from it in over 20 years, but it is a known problem.

We immediately got a yoga mat, asked the patient to remove his shirt.  He fell to the ground.  We placed a cold pack under his head around the neck area and cold paper towels on his head.  We took his blood pressure it was 136/88.  He started to mention his chest hurting.  His past medical history includes fainting in the past (due to low blood sugars) and open heart surgery as a child.  He is currently under the care of a cardiologist.  More recently he has had several fainting spells which he believes is due to low blood sugar.  He stated he had eaten a good lunch around 11:30.  It was about 2:30 when this incident occurred.  We offered the patient, a banana, orange, chicken sandwich and water.  He ate the orange.  We called EMS.  When they arrived, they checked his blood sugar which it was 95.  He started to feel better and his wife drove him to the cardiologist.

                                                At approximately 3:00 pm I was called to the observation area after reports from staff that a patient needed the epi pen due to a reaction from his injection. I proceeded to the area with an epi pen and requested for staff to activate EMS by calling 911. I discovered the patient laying on the ground in supine position, alert and oriented x3, multiple abrasions on forehead and knees. Assessed patient for SOB or any other symptoms to which he replied, ?I feel light headed and my knees hurt.? Measured vital signs ? Blood Pressure 108/47, O2SAT 97, Pulse 61. Per observation nurse, LVN, patient was sitting in an observation chair chatting with his girlfriend when he fell over face forward to the concrete ground. LVN then called for help and that is when I and vaccine nurse came to assist. Per Nurse , who administered the first dose of Pfizer to pt at 2:55 pm, he proceeded to the observation area a few minutes after his injection. Time of incident reported by  LVN was 3:00 pm. I continued to monitor the patient until EMS arrived. EMS transported patient to Hospital for further evaluation. - MB, RN

                                                After taking my 2nd Shot for Booster on the morning of Friday the 5th of 2021. I ate and hydrated for the day. At home I was resting when standing up I was overwhelmed with dizziness, nausea, sweats, and then the chills and heat hit. My inner core felt frozen. I couldn&#39;t move after standing up and the chills locked every bone in my body I couldn&#39;t breathe. Terrified doesn&#39;t cover how afraid I was at that moment. Teeth chattering, fingers rigid, and my back was solid. After moments in this state, I put on layers of sweaters to warm myself. The outside temperature was 65-70*C. So not that bad. I was in shock and not long after putting on my sweaters. My skin felt like it was sun burned and all the weight of the clothing was painful.  I could not lay down, or even roll on my side for rest. Even standing up made my spin hurt.  The muscles in my lower back seized up and the pain was right in the middle of my spin. (The ER Doctors checked and I do not have kidney stones.) I was fighting 99.3&#43; temp and rising. (This temp is accurate. I have phot evidence.)  There was no sleep that Friday night.  Saturday morning I called the first available chiropractor and went to that appointment at 2pm.  As a new client they don&#39;t want to go all out in the first session, but I was in pain with every breathe.  Hyperventilating and over breathing was causing issues with my head and stomach.  The session was amazing, electro therapy mixed with heavy cracks worked on by a professional did help, but only for a brief period of time. Walking away from the building I was still in more pain than ever.  My dad arrived to take me to the ER at roughly 6pm.   Doctors gave me fluid and anti inflammatory drip. Potassium and Tylenol.   It worked. The pain was unreal and I welcomed anything to end the suffering.

A 38-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 24Mar2021 09:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EP6955) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included indapamide, and fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) taken for an unspecified indication. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL3248) on 04Mar2021 11:45 AM on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that on 24Mar2021 he received his 2nd dose of COVID 19 vaccine. On 25Mar2021 he woke up at 6:30am with fatigue and a stiff jaw. At around 2pm he began feeling feverish accompanied with body aches and it continued until 3:30am of 26Mar2021. During that time, he did not notice any face or jaw discomfort. On 26Mar2021 and 27Mar2021 he had little to no symptoms other than slight discomfort in his jaw. On 28Mar2021 he began to feel more intense symptoms in his face, losing the ability to move/control muscles in the right side of face. The symptoms were moving from his jaw to my cheek and impacting his vision. He reported that this was out of the norm, and it prompted him to contact his healthcare provider. On 29Mar2021 at 1:40, he sought care from his healthcare provider. After a full examination he determined that he had a moderate (level 3) case of Bell&#39;s Palsy (reported started on 25Mar2021 07:00). Bell&#39;s palsy resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. He was prescribed 80 MG/day of Prednisone for 7 days. The patient has not recovered from the events at time of report.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

So much so that I pulled over my car on the side of the road, used my inhaler that I very rarely use.  I also went to a store to get some caffeine, thinking it may help with my dizziness.  I was going to call the nurse line, but started getting better about an hour later.     My allergist has advised me not to get the 2nd shot.

                                                About 5 minutes after the injection I get a tingling feeling all over my body.  That quickly subsides. Then my heart rate jumps from 75 to 140. My face goes flush and I feel like I am going to pass out. This happened on the first shot so I purchased a blood oximeter for my second and watched it closely. My blood oxygen never went below 96 and mostly remained at 98.  Once my pulse hit 140 it immediately began to fall back to 75. About the time the nurse I alerted got there is was back to normal. I do not feel sick at all after either shot. Sure wish I knew what this reaction I am having was.

A 38-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8737), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Apr2021 14:00 at age of 38 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included mystery cough from 2018 and not ongoing, seasonal allergies, used an arnuity inhaler for this, ADHD and depression. Concomitant medications included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) from Sep2020 to Apr2021 for depression; bupropion from Aug2020 to 20Apr2021 for depression; amfetamine sulfate (AMPHETAMINE SALTS) from 2018 and ongoing for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Around 14Apr2021, he had cold and flu like symptoms. He said he had headache, and sinus pressure, drainage and congestion. He said he felt dizzy, and he compared his dizziness to a feeling one gets before one passes out. He said it is associated with head or eye movement, and that there was a nerve shoot through his head down to his arm. This was accompanied by a tingling sensation that would usually last for less than a second. He said this reaction lasted for 2 and a half weeks. Patient mentioned that he consulted his physician, and was prescribed with doxycycline, which helped with the relief of his cold and flu like symptoms, as well as the congestion. He said it has been cleared for 5 days now. On 17Apr2021, patient said he had fever with a temperature of 100 F. He was concerned because the fever had not subsided ever since. On 17Apr2021 he had onset of fever which was ongoing. He was struggling to narrow down the choices here. He was grasping at straws trying to figure out if this ongoing fever fits in the realm of rare side effects of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine and asked for further information regarding the fever. He later mentioned he also had cold-like symptoms and an other weird symptom. Fever was typically in morning temperature was 100.2 to 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit then got to about 101 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon. Cold-like symptoms was for the first 2.5 weeks had headaches, sinus-related symptoms like runny nose, congestion, sinus pressure. He thought the sinus pressure in particular could be associated with the other weird symptom he had. One of patient&#39;s sons daycare had a cold going around his class on 14Apr2021; some of the kids went home with colds and fever so he initially chalked this up to that. Otherwise he did not think so. As a kind of cover her but his doctor did prescribe doxycycline which he just finished the last dose so been on that for 10 days at 100mg twice daily. He thought due to that any of the sinus symptoms he had have dropped. He felt cured of those other than fever; only fully recovered completely about 5 days ago (06May2021). Patient had COVID PCR test: First test in Apr2021, probably on 19Apr2021 or 20Apr2021. Not admitted to hospital, no ER visit, but went to hospital that his physician was associated with to have chest x-ray (Nothing notable found) and blood panel (Nothing notable found, didnt lead to anything. Standard blood work nothing notable found. White blood cell-nothing notable found.) done on 24Apr2021. COVID antibody test on May2021 was positive (IgG positive for COVID antibodies, IgM negative, no active COVID). COVID PCR test in Apr2021 and 26Apr2021 was Negative for COVID. AE (virtual visits for the fever) required a visit to physician office. Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine delayed twice now; was supposed to get second dose on 03May2021 but since had a fever been told he can&#39;t. Outcome of event fever was not recovered and the other events was recovered on 06May2021.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

I was light headed and had a little bit of breathing weirdness. It probably only lasted about 2 minutes. I laid down and all symptoms went away in about a minute.   The only other time I fainted in my life it was from seeing blood shoot out of my body but it wasn&#39;t accompanied by heart flutters.

                                                I got gout in the big toe fingers in both my legs just 3 days following the 2nd vaccination shot, resulting in immense pain in my legs and making me completely unable to walk. I have been into an urgent care where they confirmed it is indeed gout and no swolenness due to fracture or infection.  I never had history or symptoms of gout or similar kind of illness ever earlier. I do exercise regularly, do not smoke or take alcohols, have properly maintained dietary habits and keep myself well hydrated. Given such lifestyle, the occurence of gout at an age of just 38 seems remote. So I have my doubts on the vaccine side effects. JUST A DISCLAIMER, I MAY BE WRONG.

                                                On day 2 or 3 of getting the shot, I started feeling a burning sensation in my chest and what felt like my heart. It was about 3 or 4 out of 10 on the pain scale. I also had intermittent tingling sensations, mostly on my cheek to the left of my nose, but also tingling in locations around my body which happened only a couple of times.  My heart beat rapidly. It was similar to the heart palpitations I get when I eat certain foods. It also felt as if my heart was constrained, as if its outer layers were less flexible than usual.  When the symptoms showed up I started following a fairly aggressive anti-inflammatory diet, mainly wheat/cereal and Advil. I spent most of the time  lying in bed facing up, in order to minimize strain on my heart. I had trouble laying on my side, since my chest/heart was sensitive to pressure. I also believe I was more acutely aware of the distribution of blood throughout my body, and laying on my side felt similar to being upside down in that blood was pooling heavily at the bottom, but I may be misremembering the sensation.  I don&#39;t know if I had shortness of breath, since I took care to avoid exertion. Since my heart was beating like crazy, exertion of any kind seemed like a really bad idea.  The symptoms did not change in severity for a couple days. On day 4 or 5 of getting the shot, I felt slightly feverish for about a 10 minute period. During this time, I noticed the burning sensation weakening slightly, and I began feeling a soreness on my chest near my left shoulder, which I believe is a lymph node area.  Each day after, the symptoms and my heart calmed down little by little.  ----  On day 9, I went to the emergency room since I still had heart palpitations and the burning sensation at about a 1/10 pain level. Just sitting upright caused my heart to go into overdrive. The hospital did not find anything out of the ordinary. I was given MAALOX, but the burning sensation was too faint to know if there was any improvement as a result.  Their best theory is that I had costochondritis.  ----  On day 11, after eating dinner I started getting &#34;chronic hiccups&#34;. These last anywhere from 10 minutes to a couple of hours without stopping. I am not sure whether food or drinks cause them. They are short/acute hiccups and happen at an interval of about 10-15 seconds. I have no history of such a thing.  ----  Today is day 12. The symptoms are noticeably better since I visited the hospital, but the burning sensation is still present around what feels like my heart and the hiccups aren&#39;t stopping.  My best theory is that I may have had an infection by the time I got the vaccine. Maybe I had an infection, not necessarily COVID but some related virus, that was kept in check below an immune response threshold until the vaccine came along and led to the immune system burning the whole infection down.

Lasted about 5-10 minutes, and have felt worn down with a mild headache the rest of the day. I wouldn?t think it?s vaccine related, but this has never happened to me before.

These full body muscle episodes only seem to come in waves of 24 hours, then seem to feel recovering, only to relapse again. injection site pain seems to have wrapped around to the bicep 24/7 pain. unsure if this is nerve or muscle. 3 ER visits, PCP visits, blood tests, no help. I cannot work, constant nerve firing muscle spasms and nerve pain and episodes of weakness so bad you cannot sit without agonizing pain. I am disabled from this and still searching for help

                                                1st covid shot: 10 minutes after I felt light headed and numbness\tingles throughout my entire body for up to a minute. (didn&#39;t eat prior) 2nd covid shot: felt similar symptoms but only lasted a few seconds. (ate that day) ------------------------------------------------  Issues\Symptoms Week 1  May 2-8 Right eye started slowly watering on Sunday and kept going for a week  Dizzy moment on a trip. Eye stopped watering mostly by Saturday -----------------------------------  Week 2  Dizzy moment again at a friend&#39;s  house(hadn&#39;t eaten that day).  Numbness through arms/weakness. May 10th: Panic attack. I was driving home and felt the numbness go through my arms so I pulled off and called friends to come and get me and take me home.  Ended up calling another firend who is a nurse and she had me squeeze someone&#39;s hand and check my face for sign of a stroke etc.  She thought I was having a panic attack and said to get some food, take some melatonin and try to calm down and goto sleep which I did.  May 11th: Saw General doc  who ordered blood work and heart monitor. No recommendations for immediate issue. EKG looked fine.  Through the week Numbness and tingles in arms and head Ringing in ears, lots of head/sinus pressure, unable to focus, brain fog. -----------------------------  Week 3 May 19th: Had blood drawn for testing: Night before getting heart monitor I couldn&#39;t sleep because it felt like not breathing fast enough made me light headed to the point I could pass out and was getting worried.  May 20th: Fitted with a heart monitor for 48 hours.  I was freaking out when we got to the hospital and almost went to the ER but we went to cardiology and saw the nurse who helped calm me down and did another EKG which looked good. Blood pressure was high that day possibly from the anxiety. Stayed at my dad&#39;s the next few days with the monitor, had tingles a couple times, some pressure, but slept well. ------------------------------  Week 4 May 24th: Followup with General doc said blood tests looked good, not diebetic, blood pressure fine, no signs of heart problems.  Gave me 6 days of prednisone and Nasonex for possible inflammation of Eustachian tube. (didn&#39;t feel like they helped any)  through the week: Felt okish for a day and a half, drove to work and then towards the end of the day started feeling off, right side feels like it&#39;s floating up and down, sensation down through leg which lasted about a week. Pushed in between nose and cheek on right side and felt numbness/pain shoot through my head on that side Periods of ringing again though not as much but also periods of head pressure and pain if resting head on hands etc. ---------------------------  Week 5 Muscle spasms in both arms lasting a couple minutes, finger twitching on left hand.  Also had muscle spasms in legs since.  ENT visit June 2nd: Audiologist tested hearing and saw no issues. ENT  gave me an exam and did not find any issues with the Eustachian tube or any other problems.  Suggested to do see if the symptoms continue to lessen and if they dont then do a VNG test and if that doesn&#39;t provide anything that he would have to refer me to a Neurologist next to see if they can find anything.  After the visit I came upon a web site and found that there are 300 pages of other people posting having the same symptoms as I have been experiencing for varying lengths of time, some upwards of 10 weeks. https://vestibular.org/forum/dizziness/covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/ At this point I am absolutely convinced my issues have been as a result of some sort of reaction from the covid vaccine. There are way too many people having the same issues in a similar timeframe for not to be true.  In the few weeks since I still have symptoms that come and go but don&#39;t last nearly as long when they do. However it can still be quite disruptive depending on the circumstance.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I felt myself get very flushed and slightly lightheaded.  This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

                                                Within an hour of the shot, started feeling dizzy.  Intense fatigue and full body aches set in within 3 hours.  Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours.  Low fever, chills, heavy heart beat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours.  Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours.  At ~4 days since the first shot, the facial numbness, heavy heart beat, and fatigue persisted, though the drooping became less prominent and the other symptoms have largely resolved.  At ~2 weeks since the first shot, the facial numbness has been constant, but varying in intensity, and the left-side facial drooping has returned multiple times.

During the screening process, the patient did state he has an issue with needles in the past. Patient was with his wife who confirmed that it has never been due to the medication but just a fear of needles. Patient gets lightheaded. After giving the vaccine, the patient was fine at first but then did state he wasnt feeling well. The wife, came and held his hands and I was holding his back and head. Patient did tense up and shook once (not a seizure) and did lose consciousness for about 10 seconds. Had a tech call a code white and store management did come. Patient came back to and seemed fine. He had a Gatorade and drank that and also a bottle of water. Patient started to feel a little better but had a second minor episode (did not seem to lose consciousness). We also got a cold pack and placed on patient&#39;s head/neck. He ultimately took about 45 mins to an hour post dose and was able to leave under his own power. Patient and wife appreciative of efforts.

A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 12:15 (lot number: EN6208) as single dose at the age of 39 years old for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies: minor reaction to iodine CT contrast. Concomitant medications included fish oil, turmeric [curcuma longa rhizome] (TURMERIC), and xantofyl (LUTEIN); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took iodine and experienced allergies (minor reaction to iodine CT contrast). On 11Mar2021 12:45 PM, within an hour of the shot, the patient started feeling dizzy. Intense fatigue and full body aches set in within 3 hours. Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours. Low fever, chills, heavy heartbeat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours. Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours. Facial numbness, heavy heartbeat, and fatigue persist, though drooping has become less pronounced and the other symptoms have largely resolved at 100 hours since the first shot. Seeking guidance on whether further medical help should be sought (did nurse line call with insurance company) and whether the booster shot should be administered. The AEs resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was given for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. No other vaccines received four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae.

                                                Same as the first shot, however, the adverse effects started shortly after the 2nd shot (within 2 hours after 2nd shot, vs 12 hours after the 1st shot). The symptoms are as follows: Severe headache, severe fatigue and muscle ache, shortness of breath and mild dizziness.  Muscle pain is more noticeable at joints (knees, shoulder cuffs, ankles).  I probably couldn&#39;t walk more than 2 blocks before having to sit down and catch my breath. I probably can&#39;t stand for more than 5 minutes,  and most definitely not in a shape to be able to work (office /engineering). It is hard to pin point, but I would probably say my mind is foggy and not as sharp. However I can quantify this.  The above symptoms lasted 5 days after the first shot, however,  it took up to 14 days before I recovered from general fatigue.   As for second dose, I am filling this form 5 hours post injection.  Considering the severity and early onset of symptoms (compared to 1st dose) I can predict uneasy days to follow.  Note, I am 178cm, and 76Kgs and do not have health issues. My pain tolerance is much higher than an average person.

He sat down and became very pale.  The nurse, took his blood pressure and it was low.  He started to shake and appeared to lose consciousness.  We laid him on the floor and nurse again took his blood pressure. It did not register and he did not respond to her voice.  At this point, I called 911 and requested EMS.  The EMS arrived shortly and the patient had regained consciousness.  They took his vitals and transported him to the hospital to check him over.

A 39-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 25Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s prior vaccinations included tetanus shot on 09Feb2021. On 28Mar2021, 2 days after taking the first dose, the patient experienced reactions from the vaccine which included Itchiness on the abdomen area, knees, and toes and disorientation and went to emergency room for treatment. The patient wanted to know whether these are normal side effects of the vaccine. Upon follow-up on 28Mar2021, the patient reported that he felt weird after receiving the vaccine and lightheadedness. He told the nurse that he didn&#39;t eat before getting the vaccine. And wasn&#39;t sure if getting the vaccine was like having blood drawn so he hadn&#39;t eaten anything. The nurse told him he might be feeling lightheaded because he didn&#39;t eat and she gave him some lollipops and the patient felt much better. The patient also stated that on 28Mar2021, he was feeling overwhelmed and cannot describe the feeling. It was like itchy or pins and needles all over his body. The patient felt like he was going to pass out, as he as disoriented. The patient stated that he went to the Emergency Department. They kept him overnight, checked his heart, did some blood work, checked his blood sugar, gave him a Covid 19 test. The patient stated that everything came back normal. The Emergency Department concluded that the events could be due to the Covid 19 vaccine and described that his system was fighting the Covid 19 vaccine or something. The patient was asking if this is normal. He was also asking for a copy of this safety report for work purposes. The patient went to the Emergency Department on 28Mar2021 (around 7pm) and was in observation overnight. He was discharged from the Emergency Department this morning, 29Mar2021 at around 11:00AM. The patient confirmed that he was not hospitalized. The patient stated that he may be overthinking about the events and really paying attention to his body. He thinks he needs to rest as he was in the Emergency Department for a long time. The patient lab test included Blood sugar test. The outcome of the events was resolved for dizziness, unknown for feeling abnormal and overwhelmed and not resolved for other events.  Information on lot/batch number obtained. Additional information has been requested.

After a few minutes, I recovered and my blood pressure resumed to normal (114). As this was happening, my partner-- who was with me when I experienced the allergic reaction--observed that my face suddenly became red and flushed (a minute after getting vaccination).  Medical staff did not  need to administer an Epipen. They had me lie down and breathe. After about 15-20 minutes I felt normal. Medical staff had me wait a total of 30 minutes before releasing me.

The fist week we suffered severe migraines, abdominal pain, fatigue and dizziness to the point of being incapacitated. A week later, we are still too dizzy to work/operate our vehicle and are always tired.   Before this event, we are both in our 30?s, exercise at least an hour/ 5 days per week and have a very healthy diet. We went from the best shape of our lives to unable to function after this first shot.   I have reached out to my clinic regarding my symptoms and they have no answers.  I am terrified to get the second round as I have missed weeks of work due to this already.

                                                12 Hours after my Husband&#39;s second Pfizer shot, he laid down and became incredibly lethargic, confused, delirious, achy, nauseous, and feverish, with shaking and chills.  He collapsed when walking to the bathroom in the middle of the night, saying he couldn&#39;t breath.  He was okay once he laid back down.  He stayed in bed for 36 hours.  5 days later he is still fatigued, achy, and has headaches and eye strain, with intense pain in his arm, and a rash covering his body.

                                                On Saturday. May 29, I experienced pain similar to appendicitis. I drove to the nearest ER where after 29 minutes, I could barely walk from pain. After 2-3 hours of testing, it was found that my right kidney had a renal infarct and that I had lost up to 25% of my kidney to necrosis. I am not sure if this is an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I wanted to enter it into the system just to be safe.
