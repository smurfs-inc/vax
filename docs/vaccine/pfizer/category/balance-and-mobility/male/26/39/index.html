                                                After receiving the first dose of the COVID vaccine I was experiencing headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, palpitations, and nausea. The first dose was on 12/21/20. These symptoms resolved around 12/26/20. I received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/11/21. I began experiencing symptoms on 01/12/21. The symptoms I was experiencing were lightheadedness, dizziness, and brain fog/confusion. These symptoms got significantly worse from 01/13/21 - 01/24/21 and I began developing profound confusion/brain fog, diplopia, blurry vision, headaches, feeling like I&#39;m swaying on a boat,  and the &#34;feeling of being drunk&#34;. As of 01/25/21, the symptoms have seemed to get better and I am starting to feel more like myself. The drunk feeling and mild blurry vision are still present as of today 01/28/21.

                                                I had a blood report taken on the 25th of February as a part of my physical. I have never had elevated platelets, but this report showed my platelets at at 499 (130-450 is reference ranges of the lab). A year ago, my platelets were just below the max at 445. Upon discussing with my PA, he didn&#39;t feel too concerned, but after asking if the first dose covid shot may have something to do with it, that became a potential etiology.  I am very unsure of my elevated platelets is associated with the first dose. Arm was stiff on injection date for approximately 6 hours. Felt slightly flu like symptoms (headache, dizziness, fatigue) that same evening of injection date and felt fine the next morning.  Blood specimen was taken on 25th of February 2021. Diet at the time is a ketogeneic diet. I&#39;d like to make it clear I mean no deception and am unsure if there is an association with the vaccine and platelet levels, but my elevated platelets is inconsistent with any other blood report in the past, and the dose 1 covid vaccine was the only &#34;new&#34; thing in my life prior to the blood draw. I figured, better to let y&#39;all know in case it became relevant. Currently on no treatments for the platelets and was told to &#34;not worry about it&#34; which is hard for me to just take.

He walked back to the waiting room and fell onto the bench. I went out to sit with him and held onto him as he passed out/lost consciousness for approximately 20 seconds. We gave him water and called 911. The paramedics arrived and checked his vitals. He was fine after that and stayed for about a half an hour before he left.

                                                On 2/13/2021, I began to experience both enhanced and new musculoskeletal and neurological symptoms that have not completely resolved still, today, 3/16/2021. While I had experienced some slight discomfort and pain of the b/l thumbs 2-3 weeks prior to 2/13, I began to experience increased pain up to the forearm in both arms on that day. In addition to pain, I had large muscular knots in the superior forearms, especially the right arm. The lower right arm felt extremely tight, and I was having difficulty raising the arm and gripping things. This continued for 2-3 weeks on the right arm. During that time, symptoms worsened on the left arm, while improving on the right arm. A week after the initial symptoms my left arm became worse, and I was struggling to lift objects as light as a sheet of paper. I was also having trouble typing at work, dialing the phone, and opening or closing my hand. Just over a week after symptoms began, I left work to determine a cause and solution for my issues. I also began to have tremors, extreme muscle spasms, and involuntary movements around this time for about 2-3 weeks. While the neurological symptoms have mostly subsided, still, today, 3/16/2021, I continue to deal with various inflammatory musculoskeletal symptoms affecting mostly my left arm, but also my right arm. Since yesterday, my left shoulder has begun to have pain as well, making raising my arm and reaching to the opposite side difficult due to pain. I have also had persistent popping of various joints in both arms since the initial symptoms began.

A 26-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot number was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right at the age of 26-year-old, on 12Apr2021 10:30, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive vaccine in four weeks nor was the patient tested for COVID post vaccination. On 12Apr2021 at 11:00, the patient felt dizzy and then the patient passed out. When the patient woke 3 minutes later, he had fallen and hit his head and injured his ankle. The patient was taken by the ambulance to the local ER and was released later that day as his vitals had returned to normal. Therapeutic measures taken in response to the events included IV fluids. They advised that the patient reach out to see if he can receive my second shot on 03May202. Outcome of the events was recovering at the time of the report.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Took 50mg of benadryl shortly after and symptoms improved over the following hour.

I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

                                                Pt. was vaccinated by another pharmacist at our remote clinic at an elementary school at 11:35am 3/11/21. Within less than 3 minutes the patient informed a student  that he did not feel well. He reported: itching, feeling hot, shortness of breath, dizziness, loss of vision, and thirst. The student alerted me and I assessed the pt. He was responsive, but felt &#34;tired&#34;. He was sitting on the floor. I told the student to call 911. I continued talking with the pt. as I was preparing the epinephrine and placing a blood pressure cuff on his arm. He became less responsive and asked me for the epinephrine. I injected him with an EpiPen 0.3mg in his outer left thigh through his pants (at 11:43am). Within approximately 30s-1min the pt. became more responsive. I then took his pulse and BP shortly before EMS arrived (11:52am) . They performed the second blood pressure reading and the pt. was transferred to their care at that point.

                                                27 year old male received his second shot today and immediately after the shot felt nausea lightheaded and dizzy. He says it feels like the room is spinning around him. He does not have any PMH nor does he state that he takes any medication. He denies any street or illegal drug use. Pt states that he had a couple drinks last night and did not eat anything today. After providing water and laying him down for 30 min he was still symptomatic so it was decided that the patient should be seen in the ED for further workup. Patient is in agreement and he will be sent.   148/101, P 92, O2% 99% 150/101, P 90  ED Note: Physical exam reveals an alert, normocephalic male he has a normal heart rate with normal heart sounds, normal pulmonary effort, lung sounds are clear abdomen is soft he does have some tenderness in the epigastric area no rigidity or distention is noted.  Patient is neurologically intact he is alert and oriented x3, able to ambulate unassisted with a normal gait, sensation is intact, strength is 5 out of 5 in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally, no pronator drift, cerebellar function intact with finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin test.  Posterior oropharyngeal area shows uvula is midline there is no swelling airway is patent.   This is an atypical presentation if the patient is actually having an reaction to the vaccination however I am also concerned for possible abdominal issue we will work him up for ACS as well.  We will give patient a dose of Benadryl to see if that helps with some of his symptoms Bentyl for the stomach cramping and spasming and some fluids.   Lab work was unremarkable patient had a negative troponin&#39;s EKG was negative for STEMI, ischemic changes T wave abnormalities, lactate was normal, lipase was normal.  Patient still complaining of abdominal spasms but states he is feeling better than when he first arrived and would like to go home.  Patient states that his abdominal spasms have happened intermittently over the last few years he has had multiple imaging of his stomach and that he feels comfortable being discharged with the intention that if anything worsens he would return here to the emergency department.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 16Apr2021 at 14:30 as SINGLE DOSE (at the age of 27 years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included coarctation of the aorta from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing coarctation of aorta (age: 3 months), only requires bi-annual cardiologist visits, loss of consciousness from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, covid-19 from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any concomitant medications. The patient had no know allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. The patient lost his vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and light-headed on 16Apr2021 at 14:30. Circulation issues leading to a black out. Within 60 seconds of getting the shot, he began to feel light-headed. Within 30 seconds of that, he knew he needed help, so alerted the emergency medical technicians (EMTs) via car horn/flashers. By the time they arrived (120 seconds from the initial shot), he lost his vision and hearing and was essentially unresponsive. They woke him enough to unlock my car door, at which point they had him lay back to improve his circulation. That ultimately worked and got him back to normal within about 5 minutes. The patient had issues like this before relating to a coarctation of his aorta which he had done at 3 months of age. Over the years, he has &#34;blacked out&#34; like this from weight lifting and other high exertion things. This was the first time it was induced without him overexerting himself, and the onset of the &#34;blackout&#34; was much quicker than what he had experienced from weightlifting. Normally, he could tell 1-3 minutes in advance that he would black out. This time, it was about 30 seconds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lost vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and feel light-headed. EMTs did an electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood glucose check. The outcome of lost his vision and hearing, essentially unresponsive and light-headed was recovered on an unknown date. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

A 27-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EW0164), intramuscular in the left arm on 15Apr2021 (at the age of 27-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On 15Apr2021, immediately after the vaccine, the patient experienced syncope due to which he fell. He fell from standing and hit his head on a table. There were no signs of soft tissue injury. The patient was brought into the emergency department from the vaccination room. The patient was not treated for the events. The clinical outcome of syncope, fell from standing and hit head on table was resolved on Apr2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of  BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot  be excluded based on temporal association.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Woke up to a burning sensation all over my face that quickly spread to my upper torso. I stumbled into the bathroom and removed my pajama shirt to relieve the heat I was experiencing. I ran my hands under luke warm water and the sensation suddenly disappeared as quickly as it came. Later that same day I experienced fatigue and loss of appetite that lasted about 24 hours.

                                                Symptoms of 2nd Covid vaccine lot EL 1284: numbness in feet, legs throbbing, muscle weakness in legs, overall tiredness  I received my second Pfizer vaccine on 1/12/21 at 12:15 pm.  After several hours, I felt weak and tired.  By 7:00 pm, I had a migraine that wouldn?t go away and I had muscle ache in my feet and legs.  On 1/13/21 I felt some numbness in my feet and my legs were throbbing.  By 10:00 pm, both of my feet were completely numb and my legs were throbbing/radiating heat.  It felt as if circulation was cut off from my feet entirely.  On 1/14/21 I went into work where I?m constantly on my feet.  I felt intense muscle weakness in my legs and thighs to point where I could barely stand up.  I immediately went to an urgent care where they started me on an Sodium Chloride 0.9% intravenous IV solution drip.  They ran blood tests and urine tests to rule out any other causes to my symptoms.  All results came back negative.  I was told to rest, hydrate, and recover for the next several days.  If my symptoms did not subside within the next couple days, I was instructed to go to the ER for further examination.

Upon review of his lab results yesterday, I called the hematology fellow, Dr. through program at hospital and he recommended the labs to be obtained and rechecking labs in one week. He felt the student was not exhibiting any emergent symptoms requiring emergent evaluation. Patient and I spoke on phone after this call with fell at 1557 4/6 and I advised him to seek emergent medical eval in ED for any CP, SOB, HA or any neurologic symptoms. Patient has not had any of those symptoms. He exercised this morning without difficulty.   He notes raised papules on legs which he has had in past. They have currently been present for a few days. He believes it to be related to biking in sweatpants. He has been in a hot tub recently, but after the bumps were present. They do not itch.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

                                                After leaving the vaccination clinic following the 15 minute waiting period, I felt normal and ran a quick errand before returning to work. After completing the errand (roughly 15 minutes), I began driving back to my office (roughly 10 minute drive). As I was roughly 1/2 mile from the office, I started to feel slightly lightheaded/woozy. I continued to drive toward the office, and within a matter of a couple minutes or less, I was overcome with extreme disorientation and faintness. Before I could manage to return to the office or pull over to collect myself, I completely lost consciousness and crashed into another vehicle. Even after the crash, I was unconscious for roughly a minute or so until I finally came to and realized what had happened. It then took me another couple of minutes to collect myself and exit the vehicle to assess the situation and ensure all parties were alright. Police/Emergency services were contacted and a police report was filed. After the event, I remained slightly nauseated for approximately 3 hours and had intermittent chill episodes, but the adverse events have since subsided.

                                                I felt soreness and pressure build up in my arm starting a few hours after the receiving the dose. The soreness and pressure got progressively worse over the course of two days. It wasn&#39;t unbearable, just uncomfortable. The second day after the vaccine I had stretched my arm pretty good for minute, when I released the stretch I felt a rush of something for from my arm into my torso. I got really dizzy and passed out, my wife was in the room at the time and said I never closed my eyes; but I had completely blacked out. My wife had woken me up and I wasn&#39;t sure what had happened, it took me about 30 seconds to realize I had passed out after stretching that arm. My arm had felt better after waking up from passing out, and soreness had passed a couple days later. I didn&#39;t get checked out,  after I woke up I started feeling fine.  I&#39;m honestly not sure if it&#39;s directly related to the vaccine or not, I just thought I should let someone know just in case.

Starting last night, after sweating an obscene amount, I started feeling dizziness. Not a normal dizziness, but a severe one with brain zaps. The type of brain zaps someone has when coming on or off affexor/venlafaxine (which I?m currently on). The dizziness only happens when I stand and the brain zaps happen more frequently than when the dose changes or is forgotten with the snri. Before someone asks... yes... I?m taking my affexor properly and haven?t changed how I?m taking it since my covid shot.

                                                The vaccination was administered on Saturday evening, December 19th, 2020. The next morning around 10 am I began to feel nauseous and light-headed. That feeling waxed and waned all day and improved in the evening. The next morning on Monday, December 21st I was 10/10 nauseous and near vomiting. I went to work but had to leave because of nausea. Ultimately I vomited upon returning home and was nauseous with abdominal pain and achy all day. The next morning on Tuesday, December 22 nausea continued but with a rating of around 6/10. Then came the intense headache, body aches, and fatigue. This continued into the next day  (Wednesday, December 23) prompting me to get COVID tested and take off of work on Thursday, December 24th. Nausea improved (5/10)  on December 24th but fatigue, abdominal pain,  and body aches did not. December 25-27 were slow improvements with nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue but were limiting activities of daily living. By Monday, December 28th most symptoms had cleared.

                                                In the evening after getting the shot, I started getting chills and became more sensitive to cold temperatures.  Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

He fell from the bench to the floor where he landed on his stomach. When I ran over to him, his eyes were open but his body was limp. I tapped his back and asked if he was ok, and he was startled as if I woke him up from sleep. He was alert and was able to speak, he asked for water and I gave it to him. I asked of he wanted me to call emergency services but he declined. He then vomited in the waiting room trash can. His sister was with him and began to rub his back and fan him. I asked again if he needed to go to the hospital and again her declined. I told them to please wait in the lobby at least another 15 minutes before leaving and he did. I called to patient around 8pm to check on him and he said he was fine and had no more symptoms.

Patient states he got the shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and Tuesday 23Mar2021 he was tired and sluggish. On Wednesday 24Mar2021, mid afternoon, he had purple splotches all over his body, in arms and legs, like discoloration, his head felt like it had been dipped in cement and he couldn&#39;t think. States he felt cloudy, dizzy and woozy, nauseous, had a headache and feeling awful. States this occurred like 48 hours after the shot. He contacted a life long friend who is a doctor and works in a covid ward and he told him he was having a reaction and to take some Benadryl and Advil or Tylenol, and the friend told the patient to lay down and rest. He still didn&#39;t feel great but splotches went away and head felt a little bit clearer and he didn&#39;t feel like he was in slow motion or dizzy anymore by Wednesday evening, so he went to bed. On Thursday, the patient went into work but didn&#39;t feel great, not feeling 100%, and about noon on Thursday 25Mar2021, the symptoms started coming back, the purple splotches, his head felt just as bad, he had a headache, slow motion and not himself.

They gave him steroids and an IV but he is not sure what it is and he was given, he thinks, Prednisone over the next couple days to help with side effects, he believes it was Prednisone, he knows it was a steroid. States he is not a fan of it and he doesn&#39;t like it at all. Patient states that he thought it was a pretty standard reaction and was not worried about it. Patient states he still gets headaches and maybe it&#39;s something else that is unrelated. States he stopped feeling tired and sluggish maybe the 29Mar2021, a week afterwards. Patient states that he has recovered with lasting effects as he&#39;s been getting migraines since then, states maybe it&#39;s unrelated but didn&#39;t happen a whole lot before.

Patient states the purple splotches went away after he went to the ER and got on the medicine, the steroids.  P atient states the nausea was pretty constant when a headache comes on, he doesn&#39;t have a headache every day but when he gets a headache he is definitely nauseous.  The outcome of the events was for fatigue and sluggish, recovered with sequela, Purple splotches, dizzy and woozy slow motion, recovered, nausea and headache not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The patient previously received tetanus vaccine (6 weeks out from his Covid Vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient stated that his side effects began on 01Apr2021. He noticed tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck. This was the same side of the body he got the vaccine on. His symptoms worsened over the next two days.

Stated that he went to the Emergency Room at the hospital where he works and they did a series of tests. He had CAT Scans with and without contrast, a MRI, and an Ultrasound. Mentioned later that they also did blood work (Apr2021). The Emergency Room doctor told the caller he was going to have his CAT scan read by a specialist. Caller stated they called him on Sunday 04Apr2021 and said his CAT scan showed an inflammatory infectious process with atypical organisms and Lymphadenopathy. He stated that he read that Lymphadenopathy was a side effect of the vaccine. They told him that the Lymphadenopathy was compressing the nerves in his neck and causing his pain and decreased range of motion. He had been on a week of treatment consisting of pain medications, muscle relaxers, and anti-inflammatory medications. The Infectious Disease was consulted and he was started on a 5 day course of Azithromycin. He was on the third day of this antibiotic per his report. He has a follow up MRI scheduled next Friday. He was calling to report his side effects and also to ask about what he should do in regards to his appointment for his second dose of the vaccination. His symptoms were worsening for the first three days. Since he has been being treated for them they have started to improve slowly day by day. Today he said there was minimal pain and tightness but he was still not back to one hundred percent. He was offered admission to the hospital for pain control after his emergency room visit but he decided to defer it to an outpatient setting. Was not admitted to the hospital. The patient felt that the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; were medically significant and stated they were disabling, at least temporarily. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the events &#39;tightness to left trapezius and left side of neck, same side as vaccine&#39;; &#39;increased pain and decreased range of motion to his neck&#39; was recovering while unknown for the other events. Patient stated that he felt all of his adverse events were caused by the COVID Vaccination he received.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be excluded based on the temporal relationship.

                                                I felt fine the rest of yesterday but started to feel really tired and worn down late last night. I took my sleeping pill like normal and went to bed. I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

                                                Started feeling very fatigued around 6/7 PM on 1/7/21. Ate dinner shortly after and took my normal sleeping pills as previously listed. Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

                                                Within 2-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel dizzy.  I signaled for help while in my car  and help arrived. Within the next few minutes the severity seemed to go from ?0-100? and I began to feel a deep impending sense of doom and panic/fear. I also felt extremely tense in my muscles and felt itchy in the chest area. That continued for 15 minutes or so before subsiding slowly. Staff surrounded my car and were very supportive and great about the situation.   It was one of the most frightening experiences to date I have had. No EpiPen type intervention was done. Once the event was on the downswing I was kept for additional observation and release on my own accord.  Everyone there was great. I am reporting for my own records in case further testing reveals I have an allergy to this vaccine for employment purposes should the vaccine become mandated prior to me having alternative means of vaccination or allergy testing competed to determine if it was an true reaction or not so I can get vaccinated safely.

The patient got the vaccine and was told to have a seat outside the immunization room for 15 minutes at least to ensure no side effects. The patient wanted to get something in the store. Pharmacist was immunizing the next patient already. Patient knocked on the door and stated he didn&#39;t feel good and was dizzy. I told him  to take a seat I was going to get him some water. As he was about to sit down he passed out and hit the door with his head. EMS was called and patient was taken to hospital. The patient woke up 30 seconds after and was dizzy. He felt better after about 5 minutes.

He was attended to by RNs who checked his blood pressure and pulse. His BP was 60/30 and his pulse was in the 40s. He was laid flat with his feet up. His blood pressure was then rechecked a few minutes later and it had come up to 102/60. His pupils constricted back to a normal size and he said he was feeling better. He was given water to drink, observed for 30 minutes and walked out to his car by an RN after 30 minutes of observation. He did report that he does this with all vaccines. He was driven home by another driver.

                                                I got my first dose 12/18/20, minimal symptoms, sore arm that lasted about 24 hours, consistent with every years flu shot.   2nd dose 1/4/21, completely different experience. I was forwarned that the first dose primes the immune system, 2nd can be worse, so I was taking 600 mg Motrin q6 hours. Despite that, my arm progressively hurt worse and worse until now I can?t lift it above my waist. Full body aches and pains. Horrible chills and so cold. 102.1 F is highest temp so far, but that?s on top of scheduled Motrin.   Still glad that I got it, but man does it suck right now.

Pt states that this is sudden onset today. he is unsure if it is related to the recent covid vaccine but has otherwise been well. He has no recent viral sx. He has no other neuro sx. He did have some pain in the jaw at the onset but that has since resolved. CT head obtained more for the jaw pain and to ensure no mass etc. It is normal. I discussed at length with the pt that I suspect this is bells palsy as he has very minimal movement of the forehead, cannot fully blink the L eye closed and has no risk factors for stroke. I did offer him further imaging to make 100% sure this is not a stroke but he agrees that he feels he has bells palsy and declined further labs or imaging. i will have him f/u with ENT as an OP. Given return precautions and f/u with them in the office. Given first dose of steroids and valacyclovir here. He will use artificial tears and tape the eye at night. .

I went to the Emergency Room and by the time I was triaged the symptoms went away. My blood pressure was 150/90 at triage with other vitals within normal limits. I did get an EKG which was negative. I was given Valium 5mg and discharged with a diagnosis of Panic Attack.

                                                Patient received his vaccine and was waiting in the post-vaccination waiting space. Within 5-10 minutes he slumped in his chair and became unresponsive. Became responsive to voice but was slurring his words. Patient was diaphoretic. HR in 90s, O2 98%. His eyes rolled back in his head  suspecting vasovagal episode, we moved patient to the floor  and raised his legs. He became more responsive. Was fully oriented although did not seem incredibly alert. Cycled multiple BPs with 100s-110s/60s-70s. HR 70s-80s  supine, O2 sat 96-98%.  EMS was called for transport to ED given patient&#39;s lack of prompt recovery. We  attempted to sit patient up and he again became lightheaded and had to lie back down. While in supine position, remained with normal and stable VS. At no time did he manifest any rash, respiratory symptoms, throat or chest tightness,  abdominal discomfort, or other overt signs of anaphylaxis.   Patient was transported to the ED where ROS was reported as:   - CONST: &#43;fatigue, denies fevers or chills  - EYES: Denies vision changes  - ENT: Denies rhinorrhea, sore throat  - CV: Denies new chest pain  - RESP: Denies SOB or cough  - GI: Denies abd pain, n/v, diarrhea  - GU: Denies dysuria  - MSK: Denies new joint swelling or pain  - SKIN: Denies new lesions or rash  - NEURO: Denies new HA, numbness, or weakness  - PSYCH: Denies suicidal ideation Vitals: BP 116/67, O2 99% on RA, Temp: 97.7F, Pulse 79.  ED provider felt this was most likely vasovagal episode given occurrence following vaccine administration and associated sxs. EKG without evidence of dysrrhythmia. No PE risk factors, SOB or CP. Pt with HA that was not thunderclap nor severe in nature and was consistent with prior migranes, thus do ot suspect SAH. No hx to suggest anemia and no anemia on blood work today. No report of  seizure. Pt is alert without report of post-ictal period.

                                                Experienced bouts of mild vertigo lasting around 5 seconds a few times a day starting after the second or third day of vaccine.  By the weekend it hadn?t gotten worse to the point where I couldn?t leave the bedroom due to the walls literally spinning. That?s as the worst day then it progressively lessened until it went away by the second week.  Thought it was worth a mention.  My gf that I live with has also had ringing in her ear non stop since the second vaccine, so I?m a little concerned about the second shot.

Initially the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, his diagnosis was changed to rare reaction to a vaccine as per ER report in the hospital. They changed the diagnosis because it was not only his face drooping (reported as drooling) but he did not have a knee reflex or any feeling in his hands, and severe muscle pain all over his body to the extent he can&#39;t move. At the hospital they excluded Lyme disease by blood work and stroke and spinal infection by spinal tapping. Then he was discharged. All events occurred on 12Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. AEs resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab (COVID-19 PCR test): negative on 13Mar2021; and on unspecified date, blood work which excluded Lyme disease and stroke and spinal tapping which excluded spinal infection. Corticosteroid was given as treatment for the events. The patient has not recovered from the events.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and an implied temporal association, the reported events are considered possibly related to BNT162B2.

                                                I sat in a chair after I received the vaccine. After 10 minutes I stood up and my legs were tingling and felt heavy.  I was slightly lightheaded too. I sat back down for a few more minutes and then I went back to work. The the tingling stopped but my legs felt heavy for 3 days. I am feeling normal now. I am aware of orthostatic hypotension and the possibility of it being from sitting in the chair and pinching nerves. I just wanted to report this in case it is a problem.

After 10 minutes I started hyperventilating, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, Left arm numbness, lightheaded, and elevated heart rate. After 1 hr symptoms subsided as I was looked after by 3 nurses. Then last night I woke up at 3 am with body aches, chills, difficulty breathing, lightheaded, tremors, sore arm, elevated heart rate, and swollen injection site. By 6:30 I was sitting up but still too weak to stand. By 9 am I am still lightheaded, sore arm, body aches, and fatigue.

This lasted for about 10 seconds of severe vertigo and then stopped. I thought that was weird and kept driving (was in stop and go traffic) then about 1 minute later it started again and thankfully I was stopped at the time in traffic. I leaned my  seat back slightly and called my wife to tell her where I am. I couldn&#39;t pull over because there was a cement barrier on one side and 4 lanes of traffic on the other. I kept on the phone with her for the remained of my drive and it occurred one more time when I was driving home. Once home, a couple more times I felt it coming on but it didn&#39;t ever happen again. I took my blood pressure and it was normal, boarderline high when I got home (140/84). The next morning I had a fever and severe muscle aches and body aches which lasted most of the day and then today I&#39;ve felt totally fine (today being 1/23).

A 33-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose on right arm, mid bicep for COVID-19 immunization. There were no patient history. Concomitant medications included hepatitis b vaccine on 14Dec2020, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]), calcium and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number:EK5730) on 18Dec2020 (left arm) and he experienced little pain around the injection site, some nausea and some bouts of dizziness. The patient received the Covid 19 Vaccine 4 days after receiving the Hepatitis B vaccination, so he identified this as an error in administration. So the Hepatitis B vaccination was given on 14Dec2020 and the first Covid 19 Vaccine was given on 18Dec2020. He received the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that originally the prescriber who administered it the first two doses had scheduled him to receive the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine as the same day as his second Hepatitis B Vaccination and he identified this error last Wednesday and stated &#34;I believe or potentially today, I&#39;m not sure which one I&#39;m sorry I had to check with that&#34;. So, he was trying to get this all cleared up. He did report symptoms for both Covid Vaccines as little pain around the injection site, some nausea, some bouts of dizziness. So, patient had already discussed the common adverse reactions with him. Patient was told that co-administration has not been studied yet and referred him to his HCP for continued guidance on how and when to space out the additional Hepatitis B vaccination that he will need. Patient was &#34;32&#34; back in December when this happened. He had his birthday and turned 33. Second shot for the Covid was scheduled the same day the Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) but due to inveigle in-charge of the vaccine, he had lost his paper work and he had been on vacation and stated &#34;had been vaccine was not found they just gave me the second Covid Vaccine and told me to come back by Thursday and I should have found it and have everything cleared up by then but then Wednesday they called me and told me that they have realized that they are not supposed to give vaccine co-administered with 14 days window before or after. I haven&#39;t got my second Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) just the first one was administered within the 4 days period of the first shot&#34;. Patient work at Dietary Providence. The patient had his blood drawn this morning (20Jan2021). Patient does not have product details for hepatitis B vaccine. Patient stated that the nurse on duty had said that the vaccine they had stocks was &#34;Engerix-B hepatitis B recombinant&#34; but that was not verified as far as definitively is just what she had stocked when he was going on his incident report. Patient further stated, &#34;As far as all things are concerned you know I went to a doctor got checked he said breathing was great, heart rate was great, oxygen level 98 percent, he has drawn blood by then is there anything that I should be doing at this point cataloging thing any other test any other people to contact. What should I do going forward specially what can I do to be helpful for you guys to get this situation clear.&#34; Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I am also experiencing headache, dizziness, and diarrhea, all moderate. Symptoms are temporarily relieved by massage and stretching, but pain is still ongoing. This has persisted until today (Thursday, February 25).

                                                I started having radicular tingling with neck flexion that ran down my left leg starting at the beginning of February. I noted it to a colleague and asked if anyone else who had received the vaccine at the same time as me had any similar effects. I was the only person noted. Slowly the tingling increased and began radiating the entire length of the left leg. It only last for a few seconds at the beginning of flexion then completely resolved. I did not think much of this at the time and figured that it would resolve. On February 27, I began having visual disturbances and symptoms similar to vertigo with a severe nystagmus with a gaze the the right. I attempted a round of azithromycin at this time thinking that there may be an ear infection and that was causing my visual/vertigo like symptoms. There was no improvement with this course of treatment and the visual issues were becoming more of a regular issue. It became hard for me to focus anytime that I would look to my right but was able to focus my eyes while looking forward and the the left. At this time, I opted to have a brain MRI done which was completed on Match 9th as well as having basic labs run. I ended up with an elevated white count on my labs with a left shift. My MRI was read the same day showing a demyelinating process. Multiple neurologist were consulted on this and they believe that my symptoms are not related to MS as the radiologist listed as his top three on his differential but rather what they called post-covid vaccine syndrome, similar to what they are seeing with patients who actually had COVID. I have no medical history, I am not taking any medications and had no symptoms prior to the vaccine. My symptoms were acutely brought on unlike MS and I do not have any of the four most common male characteristics of MS. I do not currently have any muscle weakness, I am not fatigued, it has not progressed to my upper extremities, it does not have a stalking glove approach but rather shoots down, I have no sexual dysfunction. I have been started on a high dose prednisone taper as recommended by the neurologist. My biggest concern is that when I looked for information as a medical provider, I was unable to find anything related to neurological issues and the vaccine. Once, I was placed in contact with multiple neurologist, I was told that they are seen quite a few neurological adverse events.

                                                The first adverse effect started a couple minutes after the injection. I felt lightheaded and dizzy and then I broke out into a cold sweat followed by blurry vision. I felt as though I was going to pass out. These symptoms lasted for approximately 10-12 minutes after starting and then I started to feel better. I then experienced a headache in just above the base of my neck in the back of my head and that lasted for approximately 5 minutes.

                                                I began experiencing severe neck pain the morning after I received my first vaccine. The first morning, the pain was so intense that I was unable to lift my head out of bed and consequently had to lift the back of my neck with one hand to sit up in bed. I?d never experienced this kind of neck pain before.  The pain level was equally intense over the next several days until I started taking ibuprofen . I even went to the chiropractor to receive an adjustment to help reduce the pain. However, as of today,  I am still experiencing significant neck pain that is effecting my activities of daily living.

                                                I received my shot at 3:30 PM on 01/09/21.  I felt very tired on 01/12/21 before that went away that evening.  I began feeling dizzy and nauseus around 8:00 PM Monday, 01/11/21, and again periodically on 01/12/21.  The dizzy and nausea feeling continued consistently throughout 01/12/21 and 01/13/21.  I went to my primary care provider on 01/12/21 who gave me medication to help with nausea and dizziness.  She chalked it up to anxiety.  I became more worried on the evening of 01/13/21 and went to the ER.  The ER doctor stated it could be a reaction to the vaccine, inflammation in the ear/calcium buildup in the ear, or just my anxiety.  I do want to note I was nervous about getting this shot and have a history of having trouble distinguishing between true issues I am having and issues caused by my anxiety.  As of today, 01/15/21, I took Methazine which seems to have helped the dizziness, but not completely.  I am not currently nauseus.

A 34-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, Lot number EL0140, in Hospital, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 22Dec2020 (at 34 years of age) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prediabetes (glucose tolerance impaired) from an unknown date. The patient didn&#39;t have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included metformin and multivitamins. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced premature ventricular contractions, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, shortness of breath and chest pain. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care access and hospitalization as life threatening events. The patient was treated with diltiazem, fludrocortisone, aspirin and atorvastatin. He remained in hospital 2 days and then he was discharged. The patient underwent COVID-19 test (nasal swab) on 12Jan2021 and 13Jan2021 and both gave negative results. The patient had not recovered yet from the reported events at the time of the report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events ventricular extrasystoles, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, dizziness, dyspnea and chest pain cannot be excluded as the information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. The patient is a young adult with known prediabetes, but no other comorbidities reported. Information on tests done during admission, clinical course and working diagnosis would be helpful in further assessment of this case. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

He said that he felt a little dizzy and hot and started to feel nauseous. The pharmacist gave him a cold compress and had him lie on the ground and elevate his feet. After about 10 minutes the patient said he felt fine so we helped him back in his chair and asked that he stay longer for us to monitor him. He waiting an additional 15 minutes and said he felt fine and left.

                                                Left arm was incapacitated for nearly a week after the initial injection. Arm could not be lifted more than a few inches away from torso, and pain felt like severe deep cramping constantly. No bruising or mark at the site of the injection just severe muscle pain that affected all movement and sleep.  After one week I regained more mobility but still had severe pain in the shoulder muscles around injection site. At the 3 week mark I have more mobility but still struggle with a full range of motion and lifting anything more than a few pounds.

He received his dose at about 1710 and went t o observation area for his 15 min wait. About 5 minutes into his wait he reports feeling lightheaded and feeling hot then had a syncopal episode with loss of consciousness and fell out of his chair. He hit the left side of his head on the floor. This writer her a loud thud and looked out to see him on floor. I immediately ran over to him. He was unresponsive to tactile and verbal stimuli. He finally regained consciousness with sternal rub. He was out for about 30-45 seconds.

Everything was good on Saturday but when I wake up on Sunday morning I realized that my neck is very stiff and I was not able  move my neck. The pain was very severe and was predominantly in the area of upper back and  right shoulder area.  I was on bed whole Sunday. On Monday i had the same issue. On Tuesday I got little improved. On Tuesday I can move my neck left and right with some pain but still I can?t move my neck downward. I call my doctor?s office and they told me to use over the counter pain medication and if I still have pain until Thursday then schedule office visit.

                                                Almost immediately after I received my dose, I felt very dizzy and began sweating profusely. My vision became very blurry, and I had trouble breathing. No one came to check and see if I was ok. They just waved me out of the building, being terrified of what was going on and what wanting to leave the facility I drove out into the parking lot for the additional assessment. In the parking lot, I continued panting and sweating, feeling as though I was going to vomit. Again, no one checked on me, and I was too incapacitated to &#34;honk my horn 3 times.&#34; After the additional 15 minutes, they waved everyone through to leave, so I left. There was no professional around to speak with at this point anyways. Covered in sweat and dizzy. I drove home to go to bed.  When I got home about 10 minutes later, my arm where I received the vaccine was already very sore. I laid in bed and fell asleep and continued sleeping off and on for the rest of the day and night. My shoulder was still sore the following morning when I woke up. As the day progressed my fatigue increased (Sunday was not too bad.) Monday (3.22.21) I felt terrible, (headache, brain-fog, bad back pain, bad knee pain, bad hip pain.) My symptoms have persisted all week. I am unsure as to what to do. I do not have a doctor that I regular see. I am afraid to receive another dose and have even worse reactions/side-effects

When he came downstairs, he could not hold himself, and I noticed his mouth was tilted to the left with drooling, and weakness on his left side. We had him sitting in the chair and I drove him to the ER immediately.

                                                2nd dose administered Thursday Jan 14th @ 2pm. Symptoms started  Friday Jan 15th  @ 0630 am. Became extremely lightheaded/dizzy. Became nauseous. Felt as I was going to pass out. Made it to bathroom as I thought I was going to vomit. Essentially collapsed on floor and had severe rigors/uncontrollable shaking throughout entire body for 30 minutes. Felt as I was being electrocuted, it was extremely intense and could feel it through every part of my body. Teeth were clenched entire time and could barely open mouth. Attempted to get up multiple times but could not make it past getting on my knees. Laid on floor  until shaking eventually subsided. Had severe headache after (i assume it was from clenching teeth for 30 min). Extreme fatigue.  Was sent to ER per policy for covid test - results negative. Sent home from work per policy. Slept remainder of day. Woke up @ 5 pm feeling substantially better.

                                                Severe cervical spine pain and stiffness with paresthesias in bilateral arms and weakness in right tricep and scapula. Took OTC acetaminophen and NDAIDs. Visited employees health who sent me to urgent care for neurological exam. Urgent care physician noted right arm weaker than left and recorded report of bilateral upper extremity paresthesia. Recommended follow up exam and cervical MRI if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within 7 days. Neck pain has improved but still present. Paresthesias still present. Right arm (dominant arm) still weaker than left. Will follow up with primary care physician this week if symptoms continue.  Additional side effects: headache, dizziness, nausea, shivers, fatigue, joint pain (all resolved within 72 hours).

                                                24 hr after vaccine, I had fatigue and generalized body aches and left arm pain at site of injection. I took tylenol.  Those stopped by the second day morning (day after vaccine). However, in the second morning ( day after vaccine) I started having pain on left side of neck and on Trapezius muscle on left shoulder blade - and had that pain for three more days. Range of motion for neck restricted for three days. All symptoms improved after four days. I took Lidocaine patch and Tylenol for neck and shoulder blade pain.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

I took tylenol, fever subsided,  and was able to return to sleep at approximately  4:00AM. I woke at 6:30AM with headache, dizziness, and fever (99-100).  I took more tylenol and fever and headache subsided. For remainder of day temperature would start in increase, but stayed below 99, and headache would return between doses of tylenol. I slept through the night of 1/9/2021 and woke 1/10/2021 without fever or headache, although I would experience dizziness with exertion above level of walking.  Today, 1/11/2021, I am not experiencing any symptoms.

                                                Was administered the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in our drive-thru clinic on 3/4/21 at approximately 2:15pm. Was in the driver&#39;s seat of his SUV with his father in the passenger seat. Nothing in the PQCF gave us any reason to be concerned over this particular administration. After administration, was asked to pull forward and park in a spot on the right in order to sit for his required 15 minutes post-administration. became unresponsive as he was attempting to park and continue to turn the wheel causing him to drive in a U shape into a rock covered median. The SUV was able to clear the median and the car stopped at the APEX. When I saw the car heading towards the median, I started to head toward the site safely. I approached the car slowly asking him to stop. When I did not receive a response, I knew something was wrong. Once I felt the car was safe to approach, I ran to assist the patient. The patient was barely able to communicate but did say he was dizzy.  15 seconds later he was unable to communicate, I called a second pharmacist  to run over with an epi pen just in case (this was NOT administered). I immediately called 911 at 2:21 pm. reached into the vehicle and got the vehicle into park, while I assessed his airway, breathing, and pulse from a seated position. The patient began to seize. I continued to hold the patient from outside of the vehicle to maintain the patient&#39;s airway and keep him from hurting himself on the steering wheel. The patient regained consciousness approximately 3 minutes later with no memory of what happened. EMS arrived on scene about 2 minutes after he regained the ability to communicate. While EMS assessed the patient, and I reached out to  and division one store management per SOP. EMS determined that the patient had a seizure and was able to go home if they wanted. The father moved into the driver seat. We monitored the patient for 30 minutes and allowed them to leave. We followed up with the patient via phone 2 hours later with no concerns noted. No property damage or bodily harm occurred during this incident. If we are given approval to vaccinate this patient with a second dose, we will arrange for this patient to be taken care of in the pharmacy.

Then as he was walking to schedule his second appointment soon after the vaccine, he fell to his knees (no CHI).  I was notified and ran over to see pt was disoriented, pale, diaphoretic.  While measuring his left arm BP (80/30), he began to convulse with both elbows flexed.  The convulsions lasted about 10 secs, pt did not recall the event, we held him in a seated position on the floor.  He felt much better after the convulsion &#43; water/snacks, however we did call EMS during the event.  Per EMS, BP was 128/80, and pt was AAOx3.  Pt refused to go to the hospital and agreed to f/up with PCP.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                4 days after the first shot I was feeling very very dizzy.   My ears felt full enough that I thought maybe they were just full of wax.  I bought an over the counter ear cleaning kit.  That didn&#39;t relieve any symptoms.  I never get headaches, but a couple days later the front top of my head was throbbing.  The area just above my forehead.  It was not sinus pressure, my face didn&#39;t feel any pressure or pain.  My throat also felt like I was being slightly choked.  Not my airway, but just my jugulars.  It began in the evenings.  It would feel like I had been hanging upside down for a while.  My head felt full of blood, like it was going to pop, like my eyes were bugging out.  By a week to 10 days later, my upper arms felt weak, my toes were tingling, and my heart would flutter for just a few seconds occasionally.  I was still dizzy, still felt like I was choking, except I was feeling this way all the time now.  The symptoms only seemed to be staying the same or getting worse.  I have NEVER gone to the doctor on my own in my life to get something checked, but this had me disconcerted enough to check in and see if I should get my second shot at all.  My appointment was to see my doctor was the morning of the same day I was scheduled to get my second Pfizer shot.  My doctor had not heard of these symptoms being associated with the Pfizer shot and chalked my symptoms up to stress.  I am not a stressful person and very much err on the side of &#34;waiting to see what happens&#34; if I feel sick.  I never feel sick.  But I accepted the explanation and took the second shot that day anyway.  It should be noted that the second shot made my left armpit swell up quite a bit.  I did feel dizzy again, but not nearly as much.  The other symptoms seemed to not be as bad either.

First night, it was very difficult to sleep - I did not get much. Dizziness was like being very drunk. Now every night laying down in bed looking up is dizzying, some nights worse than others but not as bad as first night of symptoms. This has been persistent for about a week. Some temporary dizziness when reorienting head quickly during the day, particularly looking up or down, but mainly worse at night in the dark, not debilitating. Sleeping with some low lights on helps reduce spinning feeling. Mild headache and tight neck/shoulders starting 9 days after injection but may be unrelated.

A 36-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0151) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 06Apr2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6205) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm from 16Mar2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not diagnose with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was very sick for 4 days: fevers which came and went, chills, sweats, nausea, loss of appetite, light headedness, lack of energy. As a result of his immune system being weakened, he wound up with Cellulitis which he was still fighting over 3 weeks after the shot. As the patient was normally a healthy male, it was strange that he would wind up with a bacterial infection. The patient also stated that after the second dose he experienced cellulitis in his left leg to thigh area. He went to emergency room for scan and to rule out clot. He thought he was immunocompromised and that was why he got the cellulitis in the leg. Caller wanted to get the compensation information to help with the bills. The events onset date was 06Apr2021 17:00. 2 rounds of antibiotics was received for the events. The events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included ultrasound with unknown result. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                EE reports he received pfizer vaccine on 1/21/21.  He noted extreme fatigue on 1/22/21 and today 1/23/21 noted an inability to form words and talk while on the phone, dizzy, tongue is half numb, and notes sweating.   EE advised to f/u with ER for assessment.  Consult with Dr.  e-mail was sent alerting her to this reaction.  MAJ follow up on 1/26:  ED record reviewed.  EE had vaccine injected on 1/21 and experienced chills and nausea on 1/22.  On 1/23 he had 1-2 minutes of aphasia and R jaw numbness.  ED evaluation that afternoon revealed a well-appearing adult with normal vital signs and neurologic exam.  Assessment by ED physician was that this was not a stroke or transient ischemic attack but might be a vaccine-related adverse event.  The ee was referred for follow-up with his PCP, Dr. , who can be emailed if further follow up information is needed.  I suspect the ee became dehydrated from vaccine-related nausea and that this was the cause of his transient neurologic symptoms.

A 37-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date: unknown), via intramuscular route on his right arm on 16Dec2020 15:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient had no known allergies and had no COVID prior vaccination. There were no concomitant medications. On 24Dec2020 at 19:00 (reported as 8 days after vaccine), the patient experienced severe vertigo and nystagmus. Presumed diagnosis vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis. It has now been one month since onset of symptoms. Much improved but still some persistent vertigo. The reporter was thinking that the events were unlikely to be due to COVID-19 vaccine but given uncertainty of etiology, he thought he should report it. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab and polymerase chain reaction (PCR): negative on 02Jan2021. The patient had no prior vaccination. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of onset of severe vertigo, nystagmus, &#34;vestibular neuritis&#34; and &#34;labyrinthitis&#34; which included prednisone. The outcome of the event vertigo was not recovered while recovering for the event nystagmus, &#34;vestibular neuritis&#34; and &#34;labyrinthitis&#34;.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events vertigo, nystagmus, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis are likely intercurrent and are unrelated to suspect drug BNT162B2.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was feeling normal until later on in the afternoon  when I started  woozy and a bit weak. The next day Saturday I started feeling  a bit weak and not  sick but also as if something was wrong. I also had some throat discomfort.  Sunday was similar but some lingering headaches began. I also felt weaker and some slight muscle aches. Sunday night I slept 10 hours (I had had seen friends on Saturday  evening for a birthday so  i didn?t  get much sleep). Monday came around and the throat discomfort persisted along with the lingering headaches and slight weakness.  By then my blood sugar levels were getting higher and I would not be able to lower them  with the number of units of insulin I normally take like I used to prior to vaccine injection (this happens when my body is sick or reacting to something)   Monday night I fell asleep and woke up at 3 am with a piercing headache ( the most painful headache I?ve ever felt) along with radiating pain to my neck and drenched in sweat. It felt like I had just gotten out of a shower but wet with sweat. My body and bed were soaked. I barely stumbled to my counter to take an Advil and Xanax ( prescribed) to ease the pain of the headache luckily after an hour I fell asleep.  When I woke up on Tuesday I still experienced weakness and a woozy feeling like I?m sick but really wasn?t.  I was getting some chills and hot flashes but did not develop a fever.  Tuesday evening I took an Advil before bed to try to avoid the painful headache. I again woke up at 3 am with no headache, but once again drenched and soaked in sweat. I had to sleep on the other side of my bed. I drank water and took an Advil and Xanax and managed to fall asleep. From then on, on Wednesday and forward I was waking up with sweats but they were getting better.  I did notice extreme levels of dehydration during the day and night (I never had them before) a heart rate which was at 100bpm resting and blood sugar that not decrease  even when I injected 3x my normal insulin amount.  Again, this has happened a couple of times in the past only when I?ve been sick or my body has been reacting to something. It was very alarming. Nothing that I took lowered my heart rate nor did 3-4x the amount of insulin lower my blood sugar. I had the lingering headaches still and just felt very worn out and achey.   It?s not Wednesday 3/10 and thankfully my heart rate and blood sugar stabilized over the last 2/3 days and I am not waking up drenched in sweat. At all as of last night.  These affects were very concerning and alarming. I got anxiety and a lot of tension which I?m sure did not help.  This all lasted 8-9 days from the time of injection.  Lastly the injection site on my arm does not look normal. It looks like there are some bruise spots and it seems like it may be swollen (looks bigger than before)

                                                Well I?m alive. It started about 45 minutes after taking the vaccine. It began as heavy salivating and turned into a numb tongue. I have never had an allergic reaction, so didn?t pay much attention to it. After returning home I became severely lightheaded and almost passed out. I immediately took a Benadryl and Motrin. Then my heart rate shot up to 160BPM according to my smart watch and maintained that for around 5 minutes. The home medicine helped it to subside, but the same feelings would return in moderate waves. By 2pm, I decided I should seek professional help and was taken to the ER by a family member. By this time I had moderate chest and jaw was very tight. At the ER I was monitored for 1 hour and then given an IV injection of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Decadron(steroid). I immediately get relived and well. I was released from the ER around an hour later and sent home with a prescription of Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone Oral Steroid. I have since had a few different side effects like chest pain, extremely flushed face, and low grade fevers. The medicine taken at home immediately stopped the face flushing.

A 37-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 19Feb2021 13:00 [also reported as 26Feb2021 12:45 PM] (Lot Number: EL9267; Expiration Date: May2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included drug penicillin allergies and low testosterone ongoing since 2018. Concomitant medication included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE) for low testosterone, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin but had allergies. The patient reported that a few minutes after his first vaccination (19Feb2021), he experienced a racing heart, dizziness, sweating, and almost felt like fainting. A couple waves of this hit him and subsided after 10-15 minutes. The events required emergency room visit. The patient has not been covid tested post vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with covid prior vaccination. The patient has his blood checked twice/year all normal levels (unspecified date). The patient mentioned that he became slightly dizzy after receiving his first COVID-19 vaccine and he was not nervous or scared prior to or following receiving the vaccine. He also does not have history or problems receiving other vaccines or blood draws when he received the second vaccine, he felt normal for a couple minutes although he would feel &#34;something&#34; thought his body immediately after the injection. A few minutes went suddenly, he became very dizzy or short of breath, EMS was on standby at this site, so they advised him to sit on the floor. They connected heart /02 monitor to him (2021), and his heart rate was very highly (around 130 BPM) or then it would swing widely to less than 50 BPM. During these swings, he would get very dizzy or faint. This happened multiple times starting from less severe to severe with fainting, to finally going away, unfortunately after 30 minutes or so when the heart rate swings were observed, EMS administered Epinephrine and Benadryl in IV form. He was taken to a hospital via ambulance where he was later discharged after no issue in observation. The events tachycardia, dizziness and fainting were considered serious with seriousness criterion of hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization and important medical event. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm, at the age of 37 years, on Apr2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included brain tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. On 09Apr2021, the patient stated, &#34;I am undergoing immunotherapy treatment for a brain tumor. My doctors recommended I take the vaccine 2 weeks following my most recent treatment (administered every 4 weeks). Several hours after receiving the vaccine, the right side of my body was very weak and my balance was off. These symptoms went away by the next morning. 5 days later they came back and progressed. Ultimately, I went to the emergency room having trouble walking, using my right arm and staying balanced. All tests (MRIs, ultrasound, CT scan, extensive bloodwork, and more) proved that there were no apparent causes. Ultimately, it was concluded that I had a stroke and the vaccine was likely the main contributor. I am 37, in shape, and eat extremely well.&#34;  The patient was hospitalized for the events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: there were no apparent causes, computerised tomogram: there were no apparent causes, magnetic resonance imaging: there were no apparent causes, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 15Apr2021 and ultrasound scan: there were no apparent causes on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures (Aspirin prescription, Castor, physical therapy) were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink; chills on his body, shaking all of a sudden; chills on his body, shaking all of a sudden; blacked out, had lost consciousness; started with flu like symptoms; headache; dizzy; stomach pain; feeling very hot; he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles; This is a spontaneous report from two contactable consumers (one is patient mother). A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

He took a shower and lost his balance twice in the shower because he was dizzy. He was able to make it to work. At work, he started having a headache. It started to get worse. The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol. He took two 500mg tablets again. He didn&#39;t have any energy sitting at his desk doing nothing. He was not able to look at his computer because of the headache. He could not work on 08Jan2021.

It was mentioned that patient developed COVID symptoms on 12Mar2020 and tested positive for COVID by swab on 24Mar2020. Could he take the second dose? He didn&#39;t know if it is an allergic reaction. He thought that burning over the skin is an allergic reaction. He knew they didn&#39;t know a lot about the vaccine.

                                                After I received the vaccine, I was asked to wait for 15 minutes, which I did, later I went to do chores, though it was rainy and cold a bit. When I came back around 4pm I was feeling okay, no sore on the injection site, unlike my regularly flu vaccines that I mostly feel sore at injection site which lasts about few hours immediately after the flu shot, so it was sort of surprising to see that but later that night, my body starts feeling weak, aches and a tangling on my feet, as the night progresses up to the early morning, I was unusually fatigued and lightheaded with the regression of the muscle aches and subsequently other symptoms started disappearing, notably, I started feeling soreness on the injection site, which lingered to the next day.

                                                I passed out while sitting in the observation area shortly after receiving my shot (10-15 minutes). I was initially able to walk from the area where the injection was administered about 50 yards to the observation area. Sat down &amp; shortly thereafter could feel myself getting woozy. I laid my head back &amp; closed my eyes hoping to avoid it. I was given two epinephrine shots the second of which woke me up. Several medical staff were around me when I opened my eyes. I was taken to the patient wing and checked into my own room for observation for a few more hours. Blood was drawn and sent off for a Triptase test which came back negative a couple days later. After being kept under observation for a few hours I was release around noon. I have a history of problems with shots/needles. Haven&#39;t actually passed out from it in over 20 years, but it is a known problem.

We immediately got a yoga mat, asked the patient to remove his shirt.  He fell to the ground.  We placed a cold pack under his head around the neck area and cold paper towels on his head.  We took his blood pressure it was 136/88.  He started to mention his chest hurting.  His past medical history includes fainting in the past (due to low blood sugars) and open heart surgery as a child.  He is currently under the care of a cardiologist.  More recently he has had several fainting spells which he believes is due to low blood sugar.  He stated he had eaten a good lunch around 11:30.  It was about 2:30 when this incident occurred.  We offered the patient, a banana, orange, chicken sandwich and water.  He ate the orange.  We called EMS.  When they arrived, they checked his blood sugar which it was 95.  He started to feel better and his wife drove him to the cardiologist.

A 38-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 24Mar2021 09:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EP6955) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included indapamide, and fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) taken for an unspecified indication. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EL3248) on 04Mar2021 11:45 AM on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that on 24Mar2021 he received his 2nd dose of COVID 19 vaccine. On 25Mar2021 he woke up at 6:30am with fatigue and a stiff jaw. At around 2pm he began feeling feverish accompanied with body aches and it continued until 3:30am of 26Mar2021. During that time, he did not notice any face or jaw discomfort. On 26Mar2021 and 27Mar2021 he had little to no symptoms other than slight discomfort in his jaw. On 28Mar2021 he began to feel more intense symptoms in his face, losing the ability to move/control muscles in the right side of face. The symptoms were moving from his jaw to my cheek and impacting his vision. He reported that this was out of the norm, and it prompted him to contact his healthcare provider. On 29Mar2021 at 1:40, he sought care from his healthcare provider. After a full examination he determined that he had a moderate (level 3) case of Bell&#39;s Palsy (reported started on 25Mar2021 07:00). Bell&#39;s palsy resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. He was prescribed 80 MG/day of Prednisone for 7 days. The patient has not recovered from the events at time of report.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I felt myself get very flushed and slightly lightheaded.  This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

                                                About 7 minutes post 1st dose vaccination, patient began to feel lightheaded, clammy, tingling, nauseas, and diaphoretic. He was brought to lay down and vitals were taken. His vitals were stable and upon laying down he began to feel better. He stated he felt tingling in his left arm but it was just for a few minutes. He denies any numbness, rash, CP, SOB, HA, or palpitations. Patient reports he usually has a vaso vagal reaction when he gets his blood drawn. He felt better about ten minutes of laying down and water was provided. He declined transportation to the hospital but agreed to follow up with his PCP or the ER if he has worsening symptoms. Patient was stable upon leaving the vaccination POD.
