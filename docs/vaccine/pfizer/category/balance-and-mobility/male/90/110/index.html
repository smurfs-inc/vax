After second vaccination, was not able to stand or move after 36 hrs, at which point he was taken to the hospital. At hospital, all vital signs were good except an MRI showed cancer in spine.  Shot was given 3/1 and my father passed on 3/18.  Obviously this shot did not cause metastatic cancer, but I believe it did induce an inflammatory response of some kind that caused it to progress extremely quickly.

A 92-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 24Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN5318) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose in left arm (LOT EJ1686) on 03Jan2021. The nurse reported that patient is in a long term care facility and began with complaints of left arm pain on 26Jan2021 then complained of pain to both arms and hands on 01Feb2021. She says the patient has limited range of motion from unknown date and still, and is complaining of pain still. She says that the patient was started on ibuprofen 600mg every 8 hours as needed by mouth, and was sent to the ER on the 10th for evaluation, where they did a CT and lab work, which came back ok, and he was sent back to the facility. The patient was not admitted when he went to the ER, he was evaluated, then sent back, he returned the same day. The reporter mentioned that it seems the events were a little more than a minor reaction. The reporter mentioned the events does not meet the VAERS criteria for a serious event, but it did disrupt the patient&#39;s ability to do normal function, as he has needed help getting dressed. At first he reported 10/10 pain and was requesting to go to the hospital, and now his right arm is much better, he says a 5/10 pain level and left an 8/10 pain level. She says that he admitted to pain this morning, but he did decline pain medication, so pain is still remaining. Outcome of pain in extremity was recovering , limited range of motion was not recovered. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pain in extremity.

A 92-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3246, expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 am (at the age of 92-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in other type vaccination facility: park. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported. There was no history of any previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were no other additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. On an unknown date in 2021 patient experienced dizziness, weakness, tiredness, was sleepy, lightheadedness, unstable feeling. On 30Jan2021 patient had shoulder pain (arthralgia). It was reported that patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine 9 days ago. However, he said he was still experiencing mild tiredness, weakness, and dizziness. He wants to know if these side effects are still associated to the vaccine and if it is normal that he is still experiencing it 9 days after his 1st dose. He also mentioned that he has no temperature and his pulse and blood pressure was normal. It was then reported that patient was still suffering some side effects 2-1/2 weeks after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said the side effects come and go. He said the side effects will last 4-5 hours, and then go away, and come back the next day. He said he has checked his blood pressure and pulse, and they are both OK. He said he uses an oximeter to check his oxygen level, and his oxygen is good. He said he sleeps well at night. He said he is having periods of dizziness, weakness, and feeling tired and sleepy. He said he feels lightheaded and unstable on his feet, also. He said he feels fine now. He said his right shoulder is bothering him a little, too. He said his right shoulder was uncomfortable and bothered him if he laid on it at night. Reported his back was bothering him, so he bent over a little, but if he stands up straight, he was about 5&#39;10&#34;. He stated his side effects started a day or so after he received his COVID-19 Vaccine, and he can&#39;t remember the exact day. He said the side effects lasted continuously for several days, or about a week. He said now his side effects are sporadic. He said in the morning he will wake up and feel OK, and then after a while the side effects start. He said some days his side effects will start in the morning, and other days his side effects won&#39;t start until the afternoon. Patient declined any treatment. He said he read that any side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine only last 2-3 days. Reporter wants to know if it is a problem that he is still having side effects after 2-1/2 weeks or is there some action he should be taking. He said he figured Pfizer is the expert, so he would ask Pfizer directly. He said otherwise, he was thinking of going to an urgent care to see what the urgent care thinks of his side effects. There was no emergency room or physician office visit. There were no relevant tests. Reported his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was scheduled on 26Feb2021 at 9:30AM and asked if still can get the 2nd dose Vaccine after having a reaction to the 1st dose. No PQC was present. Outcome for the events weakness, periods of dizziness, tiredness, lightheadedness, sleepy, unstable feeling was not recovered, outcome for shoulder pain was recovering and for unstable on his feet, back discomfort was unknown.

                                                My father was in weak condition to begin with.  He didn&#39;t get out of bed for the next few days after receiving the vaccine.  The little amount that he ate was consumed in bed.  He began aspirating his food which lead to pneumonia.  He wasn&#39;t strong enough to fight off the pneumonia even with antibiotics.   He died on 1/23/21.   While he might have passed soon in any case, I believe that the vaccine may possibly have increased his weakness/exhaustion thereby hastening his demise.

                                                The vaccine was given on Monday.  Tuesday afternoon he developed weakness in both legs and could not stand up.  This was a new development;  he had neuropathy in one leg but he had been able to stand up and walk three hours before.  He was helped to the bathroom.  He said he felt better and might want to stand up again.  He was helped to bed.  He was found dead around 5:30 Wednesday morning.    He was 94 years old and had a lot of medical conditions.  No one has indicated his death had anything to do with the vaccine.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a coincidence that he died so soon after receiving the vaccine

My wife brought me home about 3:30 pm and I was tired and went to bed and to sleep. I slept soundly until about 8 pm, and my wife awoke me to eat.  I was too weak to sit up or stand, my legs felt like rubber.  I didn?t feel like eating, and I couldn?t answer her questions coherently.  My wife was worried and called the 911. They checked me and found my vital signs were normal, so they helped my wife get me settled in bed. The next few days I still felt weak and had to use a cane or walker.  My second dose is scheduled for February 11, 2021 at 2 pm.  Will I likely have worse side affects?  What precautions should I take.

The patient (father) seemed to be doing fine until 19:45 on 26Feb2021 roughly 30 hours after vaccination. He has early stages dementia, so if he was feeling ill he didn&#39;t report anything, and they didn&#39;t notice anything. He got up from the table, notably shuffled the 10 feet to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet before we could &#34;pull down his pants&#34;, and then became non-responsive. The reporter said to her son it looks like he is having a stroke.

A 95-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient has a hearing and memory problem. He later clarified the main thing is he wanted to know if he can continue with getting the second COVID vaccination. He wanted to continue but wanted to know if these symptoms will prevent him from continuing with getting the COVID vaccination. He confirmed he has no problems around the injection site. However, this is the second day and in Jan2021, he had dizziness. On 11Jan2021, last night he had a very bad headache and fatigue. This morning he is feeling better, but he still has slight dizziness. He is still three weeks away from getting the next vaccine. He wanted to know if he would be able to still take it. He wanted to be immune and to know if there would be any reason why he cannot take the second dose of the vaccine. He then mentioned these symptoms that he is speaking of are general symptoms and he assumed other people have reported them along with him because it is listed on the information sheet. Outcome of the events of dizziness, fatigue and headache was recovering, other events was unknown.    Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

A 95-year-old male patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine ), via an unspecified route of administration in upper right arm on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for vaccination. Medical history included diabetes from 1950 (also reported as 1991) and ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced not in very good shape/terrible reactions on 16Jan2021 12:00. Requested information regarding events relative to the product. Further clarified this event as to include injection site pain; tiredness; muscle pain; feeling unwell; frequent urination every 15 minutes; signs of severe allergic reaction including dizziness, weakness and sight impairment. Patient clarified that all of these events had onset of about 12:00pm-1 hour after Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered (16Jan2021 12:00) and had for the most part remained the same since onset, but for sight impairment was on 18Jan2021. The patient did not see very well; caller had to read some of the information provided in this report from forms that patient was unable to read during report. The muscle pain was marginal. The weakness was the same or worse. He wanted a pain reliver or pill. Patient did not plan to get the second dose due to adverse events. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No emergency room/physician office visit. Family medical history relevant to the events was none. The outcome of injection site pain was recovered on 18Jan2021, tiredness, feeling unwell, dizziness was not recovered, muscle pain, frequent urination every 15 minutes was recovering, severe allergic reaction, weakness, sight impairment was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.
