                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 60-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 08:00 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes, stent, and cholesterol. Concomitant medication included metformin for diabetes, atorvastatin from 2009 (also reported as Jan2020) for cholesterol, ticagrelor (BRILINTA, NDC: 01860776-60, LOT: MM0189, EXP: Apr2023), saxagliptin hydrochloride (ONGLYZA, NDC: 0310-6105-90, LOT: MJ0731, EXP: Feb2023) for diabetes, and terbinafine. The patient experienced felt bad the first day, chills, wooziness/ woozy, felt wobbly all on 12Jan2021. Then experienced feeling like has a big weight on him, blood sugar has been lower than normal, it is usually normal at 110-120, it is lower today at 96/ checked his blood sugar again later and it was 153, which is not through the roof on 14Jan2021, and he is real tired on Jan2021. Patient says he got the Pfizer vaccine, clarified to Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a couple days ago and the first day he felt bad and had chills and felt wobbly and woozy. He says yesterday (13Jan2021) he felt pretty good, and even worked out. He says he also worked out today, but he has had chills and feels like he has a big weight walking on him, he doesn&#39;t know the right word. He says he is also a diabetic, and he noticed today that his blood sugar has been lower than normal, it is usually normal at 110-120, it is lower today at 96. He says he is careful with his diet and eats the same thing. He says he hasn&#39;t taken his meds today, and he checked his blood sugar again later and it was 153, which is not through the roof, even without his medication so he would like to know does the vaccine affect your blood sugar? He says he got his first dose of the vaccination on Tuesday at 08:00AM, in his left arm. He clarifies that he has had chills today and then feels like there is a big heavy weight on him, he is real tired and his sugar is low, that was odd. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Following the shot, I went to a movie theater and during the movie began having severe symptoms which are most like flicker vertigo, causing severe dizziness.  Fortunately my wife was driving, this could have been catastrophically dangerous.  I went home and watched TV, with some symptoms in the car.  Again at home, watching TV, the severe symptoms returned.  I discussed this with my older brother, who had the same symptoms with the same vaccine (he is Dr.  I also had a discussion with my team and had another employee (federal) who experienced dizziness after the shot.   Note, that I am a huge advocate of vaccination, but folks need to be aware of this possible side effect.

Then, it was downgraded to occasional dizziness until now, Day 14. The vertigo restricted my movement and driving out of precaution. After reading similar experiences at website and others, started taking Ibuprofen and diphenhydramine, which helped a bit. Currently waiting for my second shot in 5 days warily.

Vaccinator noticed client had some trouble with balance as he was walking in so right after vaccine vaccinator was there as support to help client walk to observation area and then he seemed more off balance so she got him a chair.  Vaccinator alerted RN who walked over to observation area to get EMT.  PHN overheard client saying his &#34;throat is closing up&#34; and alerted PHN about emergency and then ran to get Ekit.  PHN got ekit from observation area and returned to client and other RN stayed to assist in observation area.  PHN called 911 at 12:40PM. Client reports having a diagnosis of lymphoma 4 months ago and being treated for fungal pneumonia 3 months ago to PHN who started to take notes.  Client was in a chair when PHN  arrived and opened ekit to give epinephrine, which client declined. First set of vitals taken at 12:42pm: blood pressure:130/50 , pulse:83, and oxygen:96%. At 12:44PM FIRE Department arrived and assumed care. Client was transported by paramedics out of the building at 12:53PM.

                                                I experienced a very sudden and intense Gout flare up that caused and is still causing an unbearable swelling in my right foot and ankle.  I have not had a flare up of this intensity and severity for over 12 years.  My Gout has been successfully managed by Allopurinal for over 12 years and I have not experienced any significant events during this time.  This time includes over 20,000 miles on my road bicycle and dozens of days over 100 miles.  Never have I had a problem.  Last Tuesday, I received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and I have yet to be able to walk or sleep through  the night for six days and counting.  This adverse effect should be followed and researched.  I also will be requesting reimbursement for out of pocket expenses due to this event.

                                                Originally went to ER, they diagnosed it as torticollis.  They sent me to my PCP who confirmed it.  I had violent &amp; severe neck pain and severe headaches. Also an extremely stiff neck where I couldn?t turn it 1/8th oh an inch to either side.  It all got so severe that I didn?t eat for days at a time and was literally not with it.  Couldn?t respond when spoken to, and became excessively weak where I couldn?t walk w/o help, and speech was slurred.  It all lasted 5 days where it was so severe.  With medication it slowly began to back off.

A 60-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER6208) as single dose at the age of 60-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included disability. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced losing strength in his right leg in Mar2021, his leg kept getting worse in 2021, he just can not walk anymore in 2021, leg is swollen in 2021, muscle pain in Mar2021 with, joint pain in Mar2021, muscle spasms in his neck because he has neck pain too in 2021.   The events losing strength in his right leg, his leg kept getting worse, he just can not walk anymore and leg is swollen were assessed medically significant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: leg is swollen in 2021, X-ray: nothing showed up in 2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of losing strength in his right leg, muscle pain, joint pain.  The course of events was as follows:  Around 21 Mar2021 or 22Mar2021, he had problems with his leg. Patient was experiencing muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg. Patient stated that was a problem. Patient had an MRI and X-ray that looked to see what the problem was. Patient received second dose on 14Apr2021. Patient hasn&#39;t even seen his prescribing Healthcare Professional yet, until Monday. He hasn&#39;t worked in five years, he&#39;s been on disability. He wanted to get off disability so he went and got a job. He started the job 28Mar2021 and everyday, his leg kept getting worse. He had to leave the job the other day because he just cant walk anymore, he has to do a lot of walking on the job. He called the doctor and told them something was wrong with his leg, they took an x-ray and nothing showed up. They did an MRI and all it shows was that his leg was swollen, no bones or nothing is broken. He was looking at Pfizer paperwork that a facility gave him and the two of symptoms are on there, so this problem was related to the vaccine. He never hurt his right leg, never had a problem until he got this shot. He was losing all his strength in his right leg, all the pain. They have been giving muscle relaxers and ibuprofen and they did not seem to work or be doing anything. First, he went to the emergency room and they gave him Ibuprofen 600 mg tablets and they gave him Cyclobenzaprine 10mg tablets. They said that he was experiencing muscle spasms in his neck because he has neck pain too. So he made an appointment with his family doctor, which there was no openings and had to see another PA. He did not know the HCP last name, but he/she was a PA in the office and he saw him/her, who requested the x-ray, and he had the x-ray done and saw him/her again and nothing showed up so he/she requested an MRI. He went to the hospital to have that and nothing showed up except his leg was swollen. Now they are going to send him to a bone specialist, but there was no reason to because now he stated he knew what was causing this. Patient took Cyclobenzaprine, 10 mg, three times a day by mouth. He states it did not seem to do nothing. Patient verified it was a prescription from the pharmacy:  NDC: 0137517-19674, unsure of LOT, expiry date. The quantity of the first bottle was 15 but he went through that already and he got a new bottle that has 42 in it. This current bottle he has 12 or 13 left. The first bottle was completely gone. Patient took Baclofen 5mg tablets, three times a day: morning, noon, and night. They were not doing anything either, well he did not think they are. Patient provided NDC: 0135391-19674. The first muscle relaxer they gave him, the 10mg one, he took it that day, it knocked him out. Caller states when he saw his doctor, he said he can not take that one while he works, he will take it at night time, so that is why the doctor gave him the other muscle relaxer, Baclofen, to take while he worked during the day. He took one muscle relaxer at night of one kind and the other kind he takes the ones that won&#39;t take him out as much. Patient stated that he had to leave his job because he cannot do it, he cannot walk. Patient took Ibuprofen (NDC: 0139246-19674, to use before 22Apr2022) 600mg, by mouth, three times a day. He took one with the muscle relaxers. Patient took verified all medications Cyclobenzaprine; Baclofen; Ibuprofen were prescriptions from the pharmacy. The outcome of muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg, his leg kept getting worse, was not recovered of he just can not walk anymore on, leg is swollen, neck pain was unknown. Reporter seriousness for muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg and neck pain was unspecified Patient received his second dose of Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine (LOT: EW0161, unsure if ER or EW) on 14Apr2021.

                                                Pt was admitted on 5/10/21 c/o of rigor.  Patient complains of fatigue, weakness, intermittent fevers up to 100.8 °F.  EMS found patient to be hypotensive up to 84/52 and tachycardic up to 120s per minute. He woke up the morning of admission and then began to have shaking rigors at 10 AM and felt profoundly fatigued, dizzy and lightheaded.  Patient does have a history of COPD which is non-O2 nonsteroid dependent and has some chronic shortness of breath.  He does use inhalers and nebulizers and also continues to smoke.  He also has a history of melanoma who follows with provider.  In the ER he was found to have hypotension and was given 2 L of IV fluids.  He also had a 3 g drop in his hemoglobin over the past 5 days and there was concern for a possible upper GI bleed.  Because of the hypotension and drop in hemoglobin he was admitted to the ICU.  He was started on Protonix IV.  Chest x-ray, CT of the chest CT of the abdomen and pelvis were unremarkable for any acute process.  He was admitted for unspecified shock which was initially thought possibly due to sepsis but this was ultimately ruled out.  He was treated with 5 days of vancomycin and Zosyn and then antibiotics were discontinued.  Patient&#39;s troponin was elevated with an elevated delta.  He was seen In consultation by cardiology who felt that no further cardiology work-up was needed the cause for the patient&#39;s hypotension was unclear but his home lisinopril was discontinued.  he did require albumin but not pressor support.  As he was more stable he was transferred out of the ICU to the medical floor.  He was started on midodrine.  His blood pressure has improved he has remained afebrile throughout his hospital course he has remained stable off antibiotics.  At this time he is medically stable for discharge to home and will continue on midodrine for new autonomic failure/dysfunction. the cause for his fevers/rigors was not found

Within the next week I started getting occasional dizziness.  I went to my doctor who said I had vertigo.  Did blood work and now I have to have a MRI.  Strange thing is my wife started with Vertigo 5 days after getting the vaccine at the same time I had the vaccine.  She is still having issues with dizziness and under doctors care.

After a month,  headaches are not as bad, still persistent.   Dizziness to the point that i have gotten nausea 5 out of 5 times being a passenger in a car,  2 of those times vomiting.  Driving a car is fine with no dizziness or car sickness.   2 intense bouts of vertigo, starting 1 week after the vaccine  Could hardly walk,  bumping into things, like  i got off a spinning carnival ride drunk.   I took zanax and went to bed,  and woke up fine.    Overheating,  hot flashes,  and fatigue also come and go.

                                                A few days after my second Covid vaccination I started experiencing fatigue, dizziness and shortness of breath.  I also noticed the calf muscle in my lower right leg began to swell.  The swelling continued to get worse and about a week later I noticed a significant amount of petechial hemorrhaging in my lower right leg.  I started using an ice-pack in an attempt to reduce the swelling.  I also sat/lay with my leg up (horizontal) as much as possible.  On 6/28 I visited with my primary care doctor to seek help in addressing the swelling.  My doctor sent me for an ultrasound which discovered a deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and a CT scan which highlighted pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  I was admitted to hospital where I was treated with blood thinners; Note: I had my first shot on 4/13/21 and also experienced fatigue, dizziness and shortness of breath, but did not experience any swelling. As a result of feeling unwell I delayed getting my second shot.

Then starting on the 3rd day until present, I feel extremely light-headed and unsteady with a persistent severe headache.  Almost feels like there is pressure in my head for lack of a better description. I feel feverish as well but do not have a fever.  I have difficulty maintaining balance on my feet so it is difficult to walk.   I did seek medical attention yet since I live alone and do not feel comfortable to drive. Although the symptoms are difficult, I also don&#39;t consider them an emergency to warrant calling an ambulance.

Went home and still felt dizzy and then I felt like I need to pee  but I was very cold ,  urinated 3 more times thinking it was because it was due to being cold but doctor explained it was due to me drinking lost of water.  Went to bathroom and bassed out and woke up about an hour later, but during the fall I injured the neck by heating your head on the sink, back and broke my nose, when I woke up  I was still very dizzy. Also felt a fast heart rate,  chest pain, very nauseas and started sweating a lot.

A 61-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL9621), intramuscular on the left arm on 22Jan2021 (reported as 07:45 to 08:00) at a SINGLE DOSE for prevent COVID, at 61 years old. Medical history included triple bypass surgery from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime. Symptoms (unspecified which) reported as recurring and are notably worse at bedtime. Patient is hesitant to receive the second dose. The patient stated he just went to sleep and prayed and then when he woke the next day, at night it did it again. At night it comes and goes, and he still has it happen but not like the first time. He tried to describe that he was washing his hands and he almost passed out like on an unspecified date in Jan2021, he was going to lose his mind. Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown. Outcome of the events dizziness, &#34;feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his brain wanted to pop out of his head/ his brain wanted to swell up&#34;, felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy, and fever was reported as recovering.

This morning I seem fine, but it was not a good feeling. I also experienced an abnormal spike in my blood sugar levels yesterday morning. My sugar level was 65 points higher than normal.

Within an hour, extreme shaking, fatigue and worse headache ever experienced in my life. Went to bed, covered up and tried to rest, but headache was too severe. About 6:00pm, took ibuprofen and headache began to subside, but too weak to walk without holding onto support items. Nausea left me unable to eat and drinking water was unpleasant. Fell asleep about 10pm and woke at midnight with cold shakes and did not get back to sleep. Went to work next morning and just felt somewhat fatigue and had no appetite.

At approx 10 minutes after sitting in the observation area, the patient started to fee hot, dizzy, some tunneled vision and nausea. This attendee did not have any sort of reaction to his first dose. This was brought to the attention of one of the observing staff members. This nurse,  was called over to the patient. The attendee was asked to lay down on the cot provided and we elevated his legs. RN, measured his vital signs: bp 110/70, HR: 60, Resp 16, O2 97%. This patient denied any shortness of breath. Lung sounds were clear, and no wheezing or rhonchi were observed. This patient stated he has a history of Asthma and took his asthma medications this morning as normally directed. This patient was directed to lay down for approx 10 minutes, then stated he felt much better and wanted to sit up and take a sip of water. The attendee tolerated the water well. This nurse, advised for this attendee to stay for another 10 minutes until he had no symptoms present. The patient quickly felt better and stated that his wife was out in the car and would be driving him home. This nurse advised for him to go to the Emergency Room if he felt any of these symptoms again.

Patient was feeling okay after vaccination and went into waiting area. Pharmacist was called over because patient fainted. By the time we got to the patient he was awake, alert and sitting upright. He knew who he was, where he was, and that he just received a covid vaccine. The patient said he felt light headed. We offered water and an ice pack as the patient was sweating but he did not say he was hot. The patient was able to get up after a few minutes of sitting and sat in a chair. After another few minutes, the patients head went backwards and he was making a snoring sound. I tried to talk to the patient but he didn&#39;t respond. We called 911. We placed the patient on the floor and turned him on his side. After about 1 minute he was with it again. He knew where he was and thought he fainted again. Upon speaking with the patient we received details about his history of seizures due to alcohol withdrawal. He also confirmed the last time he drank was that morning and he had &#34;a few shots and was cutting back.&#34;  Patient told us he was not on any medications but did take 50 mg of benadryl around 12:00pm that day. The paramedics arrived and took him to the hospital.

Severe pain started about 2 hours after the infection and throughout the day and night the pain increased to about a 8/9.  I woke up in the morning about 7 am in so much pain that I had a very difficult time rolling over in bed to get out of be to go to the bathroom.  I had to take a Percocet 10 every 4 hours for pain management.  the pain lasted till I went to bed about 2am and when I woke up the next morning the pain was mostly gone.  about a 1/2 but felt very tired/exhausted.  I got up walked the dogs and had a light breakfast and found myself nodding off several times and went to bed and fell asleep till about 1:30pm and just felt wiped out until the following day.

By next morning, my Parkinson&#39;s symptoms, overall weakness, &#34;frozen foot&#34; and (left) foot-turned-in-bent-at-ankle, resulting in my needing assistance to walk, get up out of chairs, use the bathroom, worse than I had experienced prior. Normally I have much relief with Rytary, Carbidopa-Levodopa, and deep brain stimulator, but nothing helped. I&#39;m now at 65-70% of where I had been. While I can&#39;t say with certainty that my medication failure resulted  from the vaccine, I have no  other explanation. I would rather risk whatever one vaccine has done for me against COVID, than go through this again, or worse!

                                                2 hours after receiving his first vaccine the patient was presenting with light headedness, sweaty, pale, and stomach pain. I took his BP and it was 80/60 with a pulse of 60. I called 911 because he had a history of CHF and I didn&#39;t want his pulse to drop and not have other trained personnel on hand if CPR was required. I gave him water to try to raise his BP and rechecked his BP after 5 minutes and it raised to 127/83 with a pulse of 64. He stopped sweating and his color came back in his face at that time. The EMT&#39;s rechecked vitals and ended up taking him to the ED to run tests.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0170), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 29Apr2021 at 03:00 PM (15:00), as first dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, cholesterol, and heart problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included metoprolol and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); both were ongoing. The patient takes acetylsalicylic acid because he can&#39;t take blood thinners because he works with sharp objects all day. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks; and he didn&#39;t know adverse events following prior vaccinations as he received vaccines as a child. The patient received his first COVID-19 vaccine in his left arm (because he&#39;s right-handed) yesterday (29Apr2021) and his whole body is killing him, it&#39;s aching, and he&#39;s sweating. The patient was asking if his symptoms are normal. Last night (29Apr2021) when the patient was sleeping, he went to bed around 9:00 to 9:30 PM and he woke up around 11:00 PM and he couldn&#39;t even move. The patient got up this morning and took 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL) for the events. The patient was sweating like there&#39;s no tomorrow, but he thinks that paracetamol is working. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician office. The patient&#39;s second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for 20May2021. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Whole body is aching&#34; and &#34;Sweating&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

PCP stated could take a month. It has now been over a month went to PCP again 05/24/2021 and gave him a script of pain. Why is he still having this issues over a month later.  Please please explain why he can not sleep at night cause when he moves his arm in his sleep i takes him up all night long. There must be a reason for this to still be causing him this much pain.

                                                numbness on his left leg and one time with left arm/His left leg went numb seven or eight times; could not walk; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient). A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EW0164, expiry date Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Mar2021 (at the age of 61-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: hypertension and allergic to bees. The patient had an EpiPen. He would have to use it if he ever got stung. He has never had to use an EpiPen. Concomitant medications included: hydrochlorothiazide/ lisinopril (LISINOPRIL &#43; HIDROCLOROTIAZIDA) taken for hypertension, for maybe 8 years. The patient had other unspecified concomitant medications. After receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine, the patient experienced numbness on his left leg and one time with left arm. His left leg went numb seven or eight times. His left arm went numb one time. He thought maybe it was just going to sleep. He usually slept on his arm, and it woke up that way. But he was walking, and it went numb; it was very strange. There was no pain. It began about two and a half weeks ago (2021). It has happened twice today, so he thinks it is getting worse. It was also lasting longer. Today (unspecified date 2021), his left leg went numb so much that he could not walk. He was walking, and he had to stop and stand there for 10 minutes before the feeling came back. It was very strange. His leg numbness was the most serious today. After this last episode of leg numbness, he called his insurance company, and made an appointment with his medical provider on Monday. He was reluctant to take the second dose of the COVID vaccine. The patient stated he occasionally took vitamin D, fish oil, vitamin C, and aspirin. The outcome of the event could not walk was unknown. The outcome of the other event was not recovered.

                                                He got his vaccine, he had a very, very bad headache.  About 3 weeks later his neck stiffened.  He developed a pain in his chest, stabbing in nature, down his neck, left arm, arm pit, down his side and through to his back and down his spine.   He also has had numbness in his hands.  He went to the ER because he thought he was having a heart attack, and they did a bunch of tests on him including a COVID test which was negative . They did a chest x-ray, EKG, blood work and possibly some others, and everything seemed to be OK, and could be a neuromuscular thing.  He then went to see his PCP the next day who reviewed the ER results, and he sent him to a cardiologist and he is in the process of having tests done with him.  He also has an APT set up with a neurologist and an Orthopedist as it has been 5 weeks since this started, and the pain is fairly severe.  He has an overall feeling of weakness, light headedness and nothing really relieves the pain and has been using Advil.  They told him to take Advil.  The cardiologist has not given  him any results yet.    He did ask his PCP and his cardiologist if they felt that it was due to the vaccine, perhaps a delayed reaction and they told him that they would not rule that out.

I&#39;ve never had blood clots until I subjected my perfectly healthy body to the Covid vaccination.  On the morning of April 30, 2021, I was suddenly overcome with a sense of disorientation and dizziness.  Spouse drove me to the ER. They discovered I had experienced a stroke. Let me be absolutely clear.  The Pfizer vaccine is the sole reason I developed blood clots and had a stroke.  I was perfectly healthy until I got vaccinated.  I now have brain fog, dizziness, and every day is a challenge. I feel so dumb for falling for the get vaccinated garbage.

Doctor&#39;s examination revealed inflammation of lower back around spine. X-rays revealed arthritis in lower back and minor disc slippage/bulging, as expected for age. Since no back injury or strain, Doctor diagnosed it as probable immune system going into over-drive due to vaccine and attacking lower back arthritis resulting in inflammation and pinched nerves. Treatment was muscle relaxers for a few days and Physical Therapy for lower back. Cleared sufficiently in 2 weeks to get second dose of vaccine on time, with no problem.

                                                My dad suffered what I believe to be a blood clot in his lung on April 6th, directly related to the second pfizer covid vaccination. Though chronically ill, he was not sick at the time, which was 4 days after the vaccine. He walked up the stairs, collapsed at the top, walked again to the chair, collapsed and then made his way into the chair where he told me &#34;I can&#39;t breathe.&#34; and then slumped over. My mom and I lifted his limp body up and noticed he was not breathing.  We moved him to the floor and started life support measures. About 5 minutes later the paramedics arrived.  They were eventually able to get his heart and breathing going again about 14 minutes later.  He was moved to critical care.  After it became apparent he suffered irreparable brain damage, I stopped the life support measures (ventilator) and he passed away shortly after on Friday the 9th. They were continuously removing blood from his lungs while he was there. There was no indication he would die prior to this incident. Though we attempted to tell the critical care doctors about his recent vaccination, they were not receptive to the suggestion that this may have caused the incident that proceeded his passing. My mom did try the heimlich and there were indications that he had breathed in vomit, but he had stopped breathing before this and therefore his cause of death WAS NOT aspiration. He also had fallen the day after the vaccination (Saturday) and the notes indicated his broken ribs were from the CPR measures but this is in error as well as he had broken his ribs in the fall. It is my opinion the broken ribs caused a bruise in the lungs, the vaccination caused excessive clotting, and when he was coughing shortly before the incident it loosened the clots that then caused a pulmonary embolism.

Did not worry about it at first, figured it was vaccine related.  2 weeks later i was still having issues, noted weakness when reaching up and out to pick up things.  Got to point I was reaching across body with right arm/hand.  2&#43; months later still having issues reaching for medicine in medicine cabinet, keys in closet, soap dispenser at work.  Got to point i was dropping things.   Thinking i somehow unknowingly injured myself and needing to get better quickly (ice, heat, Tylenol,  limited use was not working), went to orthopedic 7/19/21.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

I started taking Tylenol but then it stopped working.  it kept kept getting worse and I went to see my Dr. and she put me on some medication, but they did work and she sent me to a Neurologist and he put two medications. They seem to be working, I&#39;m not having them as much. I&#39;m calling tomorrow to see when my appointment is scheduled.

                                                Blood pressure was high; tired from the night before; Itchy; slight headache; little lightheaded; Heart racing; panic attack; Hot flashes; Sweating; Chills; achy/body aches; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. A contactable consumer reported for himself, a 62-year-old male patient who received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (reported as by injection) to left arm on 14Jan2021 at 3pm at single dose to prevent COVID/COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety. Concomitant medications included antidepressants. The patient received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine last 14Jan2021 at 3pm, and everything went well. When he left the place, he had a slight headache. He had to stay there for 15-20 minutes to make sure he had no reaction. He just got a little lightheaded, he didn&#39;t think much, and it didn&#39;t get worse. The patient took 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL) and forgot about it. It went away for a while. He took the shot at 3 pm and he took paracetamol at 4 pm. Later that night, about 10 pm, everything kicked in. He was sick again at 10:30 pm, or so, the headache was gone for several hours. He was ok between 4 pm and 10 pm. Then about 10 to 10:30 pm, when he went to go to sleep, his heart started racing, like he was having a panic attack, then he started getting hot flashes, sweating, chills, and aching, and this went all night from like 10 pm to 11 to the next morning. He had a doctor&#39;s appointment to get his knee examined for an upcoming knee surgery. The patient clarified that he didn&#39;t go to the doctor because of the symptoms, he went for his knee. He asked the doctor, before getting examined, and the doctor said he got off easy, as the doctor himself was sick for 3 days. The patient asked the doctor if he could take something to calm down, as his blood pressure was high on 15Jan2021 at 8 am. They had taken his blood pressure to examine his knee, and the doctor said it was alright. He was prescribed with alprazolam (XANAX), and the doctor said it would be fine. The next day, he was tired from the night before. He had no symptoms the next day. After he took alprazolam, he slept fine, he felt better. The hot flashes, heart racing, body aches, and chills were gone, and he read everything as far as symptoms. The heart racing went away about 11 the next morning because he took alprazolam. The patient stated that he forgot to add one more, he had all the symptoms described as side effects, but he also had itching. He had very mild itching and was given cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC, lot number: OHE2723, expiry date: Feb2022, UPC: 4122053077), it was like 80% gone. Every now and again he has a little itch, but it was bothering him all night that first night. Currently, the patient felt pretty good. He has no symptoms other than the slight itch. He further stated that his second dose is on 04Feb2021. Out of all symptoms, the thing that freaked him out the most was the heart racing, he asked if he could take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) before the shot. He has been on antidepressants for a while, he has a lot of anxiety, but the day he went in, he felt good, and didn&#39;t take alprazolam. He also asked if this have triggered all that heart racing stuff. He was seeking for information if there was anything to do to prepare him better, he knew you have to sit there for 15-20 minutes to see if there was a reaction. The outcome of the event headache and lightheadedness was recovered on 14Jan2021, unknown for blood pressure high and tiredness, recovering for itchy, and recovered on 15Jan2021 at 11 am for all other events.

The patient does not take any of these medications while driving. The patient took his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 25Jan2021 (Monday). The patient had been experiencing dizziness which started a few days after getting the vaccine (Jan2021). The patient was supposed to work from Tuesday to Friday, but he did not go into work on Wednesday. The patient was unsure of the specific day the dizziness started. The patient did have allergies (unspecified date), but when he called in his doctor, he sent him a medication for allergies, meclizine (Expiration Date: 28Jan2022). Normally, the medication takes a couple days to make him feel better. After he took meclizine for dizziness, he feels better. The patient notices the dizziness when he is up and moving around. The patient can tell something is off, like his equilibrium is off in Jan2021. It may not be due to the shot, but looking at the paper it says tiredness, which he has been feeling fatigued (also started a few days after the vaccine, but he is unsure specifically what day) and dizziness, which he has in Jan2021. The medication he is taking (meclizine), can also do the same thing, but never for this long. When he takes it, it normally makes him feel better after a few days. The patient has sinus problems as well on an unspecified date, but never lasting this long. The patient had not started feeling better since taking the medication, meclizine (as reported). The patient also said that meclizine could be causing the fatigue because it does make his drowsy and he just sleeps when he takes it - he cannot take it when he drives. The patient would go back for the second dose on 15Feb2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Dizziness when he is up and moving around&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Allergies&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

                                                Within 1 minute of vaccine being injected. I started to feel dizzy. I was wheeled in wheelchair to observation area. I kept feeling more dizzy and started to feel tingly in my fingers and legs (both sides equally) After 15 minute observation time was over, I tried to stand up and immediately sat down again as a wave of dizziness  hit me. Doctor in observation area saw me and came over. I told him how I felt. He put his fingers to my wrist and felt my pulse. It was initially between 40 and 90, then steadied off around 90-100. He called for EMTs on duty to come over with a stretcher because he thought I should be laid flat. The EMT took my blood pressure and it was 155/94. The doctor said at one point my pulse was thready. By this point the dizziness was stronger and I felt tingly in my teeth as well as other areas. I was asked about my breathing and I said that it was okay. An ambulance was called for and arrived. I don&#39;t remember the exact time. The moved me from the wheelchair to a stretcher. I could not stand up on my own and lurched toward the stretcher. I am grateful strong people were there to get me on stretcher and strapped in. All throughout this my normally barely noticeable Atrial Fibrillation was quite apparent and more erratic. This was a major reason for ambulance call. Some of the stroke protocol was done including gripping EMT&#39;s fingers equally and following his finger with my eyes. I was very cold throughout. I was brought to the waiting ambulance outside and driven to Medical Center. The EMT took an EKG which showed atrial fibrillation and a line was put into my arm.  When we got to the hospital, I was brought into the triage area and had all my vitals taken. Blood pressure was high, so was pulse then for a half hour, I was very hot and sweated a lot after being cold.

                                                Patient seen at the Vaccination Center on 4/9/2021.   He had just received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine.     He was feeling dizzy and felt like he was going to pass out.   He was transported by EMT to the Adverse Reaction Area and then moved.    Representative served as sign language interpreter via tablet.   His wife was also present and is deaf.     Patient stated that his heart rate was very slow, and he felt dizzy, hot, and sweating.  He also fel very weak and it appeared that was going to pass out.  He was also shaking.   Ambulance was called due to the above symptoms.  Patient also stated that he thought he may need to go to the ER.     Vital signs:  9:53 am: Blood pressure was 143/71, heart rate was 71.   Patient was given an ice pack.  He also took sips of water.   He then noted that he felt better, after laying down.    Ambulance crew arrived and he declined to go the ER.    He got up and walked around stated the he felt better.     He notes that his head feels like it&#39;s slightly buzzing, so he lay down again.   Vitals signs:   10:25 am: Blood pressure 138/63, heart rate is 64, temperature is 98.1   Patient felt better and noted no more buzzing in his head.  He also walked around and felt normal.    Patient notes that he blacked out as a child whenever he got shots/injections.  He was not surprised that this happened to him today.   He wanted to know whether he should get the second vaccine injection.  It is recommended that he get his second vaccine injection and we also discussed that he may have the same reaction as today.  He should allow for extra time and be well-hydrated.     He felt safe to go home and his wife would be driving him home.    Should he feel worse, then he should go to the ER.    The patient and his wife understand this.  All questions were answered.

                                                About 1 day after vaccination, there was pain in the muscles around the right hip joint to the extent that I had difficulty walking up the staircase.  It lasted for 2&#43; days and gradually diminished. Then, sporadic pains appeared in the right collar bone for a day, then in the left collar bone for a day or 2;  and then intermittent ache in the left elbow and left hand; and then soreness in finger joints of both hands, especially in the morning; and,  beginning 5 days ago and ongoing, RA-type pain is felt in the left shoulder, especially when I try to lift the arm or holding something with the left arm stretching out.  this pain seems to be growing. Sometimes, tingling sensation in the toes and soles of both feet.

Patient fell twice within first week of shot.  He was extremely weak/unstable.  He was starting to walk without his cane or walker.  He could no longer walk on his own. He refused to talk because he was drooling all the time.  There was little to no drooling before first shot. All the progress he made in the last 6 months is gone.  He is just starting to feel like himself. Patient&#39;s second Pfizer shot was cancelled and will not be rescheduled.

Symptoms continued and worsened over next two weeks. Went to ER on April 11th, 2021, due to immense head pressure, BP over 200, and ringing in ears. My blood pressure and heart rate were checked at ER and were high, but came down after laying down for a while. I was given blood pressure medication, Amlodipine, 10 mg tablets. Medication had minor positive effects but symptoms continued to get worse. Returned to ER on April 14th, 2021. Same diagnostic testing was performed. I was given more BP medication and recommendations were made for how to lower blood pressure with diet and exercise.

A 62-year-old (age at time of vaccination) male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm right, on 14Apr2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at clinic. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm right, on an unknown date, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing Parkinson&#39;s from 2010. He did not know about family history of having Parkinson&#39;s. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any vaccine within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The patient reported that after two vaccines on an unknown date in Apr2021, he started to shake and now was still shaking. He was wondering why he was shaking so hard. He said it could potentially be his Parkinson&#39;s and asked what he should do. Mailing and email address declined. Primary care doctor&#39;s address, telephone number, and email address declined. The patient stated the doctor was not in. Shaking was noticed after the second dose. It was improved, but he didn&#39;t like it. He could not concentrate, he didn&#39;t think right, and could not talk right. When asked to provide information from vaccine card, the patient stated he had a hard time moving, he moved so slowly and had card but could not find it. He also could not recall date of first vaccine, but both doses were given to right arm. Time the vaccination was given: 10:14:2020, was the time that second dose was received. Time was documented as provided, and confirmed, by caller. He had first one and was given another 3 weeks to come back. He was waiting for his doctor and stated he had Parkinson&#39;s, diagnosed in 2010. There was no product complaint to report. Outcome of the event he started to shake and now is still shaking was recovering and for all other events, it was unknown.  Communication: Caller had a thick accent- details were as provided by caller with clarifying attempts.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Now 18 days out from second shot, about 98% recovered from shoulder injury.

                                                The day after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, my father started to experience lethargy, headaches, nausea and vomiting. These are all advertised as common symptoms of the second dose so he did not seek medical treatment until 5/11/21, five days after. He went to the emergency room, his systolic blood pressure was over 200. A CT scan showed bleeding going from his basal ganglia to the right ventricle of his brain. His blood pressure had gotten so high that he had a hemorrhagic stroke. He has since been in the ICU. He had to undergo a ventriculostomy, was put onto a ventilator, and has now had a tracheostomy.  He still has not regained full motor function and will have a long road to recovery after the stroke.

                                                I had pain in my injection site and it has subsided but literally for 4 months from march until early June I had pain at the injection site. I had an acupuncturist come and massage the injection site. I went to my doctor and she took an MRI and my whole left hand tingles. I still have a slight tingle now.  I had to get a pain killer because I had to take the MRI and I lay on my left shoulder and I could not move but it was painful so I took the pain killer. As the pain has subsided the tingling has increased. What my doctor said is that I was injected in my rotator cuff.

After the 1st two hours, I took a couple of aspirins which had me sweating initially and seemed to help a little. I was finally able to leave work around 10 am, at which time I went to bed for several hours. When I got up, the severeness was gone but mildly lingering. As of today, there is a small hint of dizziness in the background, but I feel much better.

                                                Fatigue and swelling with joint inflammation in left extremities. Follow-up for polyarthralgia   Brief history: Probable reactive arthritis: One week after getting second COVID vaccine (Pfizer, 5/3/2021) he developed chills, sweats, SOB, cough and red/watery eyes. Initially given topical antibiotics for eyes in walk in clinic. Went back and on 5/17/2021 given Medrol dose pack which cleared up symptoms. From 5/10/2021 onward he developed left shoulder soreness and limited ROM. He has had persistent polyarthralgia with morning stiffness. Seen initially in June 2021 with noted joint effusions in left elbow and left knee. Evaluation around that time significant for positive ANA (1:160, speckled), RF (22, normal &lt; 14), SSB, Scl-70 (weakly positive). Other ENA panel and CCP negative. X-ray of left shoulder (6/3/2021) showed only mild degenerative changes suggestive that the limited ROM in shoulder is related to frozen shoulder.   Rheum Medications: Celebrex 200mg daily Doxycycline 100mg daily (started about 2 weeks)   Interval history: Patient was last seen 6/3/2021. He reports that the swelling in the left calf has decreased. The left knee has been bothering him. The mornings are the worse time of day. He continues to have swelling in the left knee. He has been doing ROM exercises with the left shoulder. At night he is not sleeping because of pain. He has morning stiffness which lasts from 20-30 minutes. He has noticed some pain in the left thumb. No eye pain/redness. No rashes.    As in HPI, otherwise 12 point ROS was reviewed and negative

Started around 6 AM by 9 AM couldn&#39;t stand  very weak  slightly lightheaded    Threw up till almost choking.  At noon my temp hit  103.7   Took tylenol all AM and wasn&#39;t lowering temp.  That was the highest temp  Then gradually began to  come down   At 5:00 PM temp at 100 and able to put soup down.  Woke up  4 AM next day in  total sweat that had to move to other side of bed  Soaked but felt OK   On 23rd  Got headache above right eye to side of frontal lobe,   Not any strong headache at all   Dull  Like a 2 out of 10.  My concern is I still have the exact same headache as I did three weeks ago  Not a smidgen lower at all  SAME.  And I booked second vaccine for Sat 2/27th    I am concerned as I have heard second can be worse.   I have never had the flu and this was my first ever vaccine of any kind    Please advise

                                                At about 5 PM on March 20th, 2021, I felt so dizzy that it was almost impossible to walk.  I had to hold onto furniture as I made my way across the room.  After this continued for several hours, I did some research on the web and was led to believe that being dizzy was a serious event.  At 7:11 PM, I got a ride to the hospital and checked into the emergency room.  I was there at the hospital for about 30 minutes and noticed that the dizzy feeling was gone.  I walked out of the hospital without every going back to an examination room.  I caught a ride home at 8:08 PM.  Note that the only other adverse event was a sore arm and a vague feeling of not being well.

This progressively got worse throughout that night.  Friday, 3-26-21.  7:00 a.m. - Woke up in more pain in my right hip and right leg. I almost cried trying to get out of bed. Felt like a car ran into my right hip. Very painful to walk. Saturday, 3-27-21. Extreme pain to get out of bed, walk. EXTREMELY painful to lift my right leg to try to go up stairs. Wife wanted me to go to the Emergency Room, but I suspected this was a reaction to my Covid shot. Sunday, 3-28-21. Same pain in the morning. Suddenly, about 1:00 p.m., the soreness started to subside. At 3:00 p.m. I could walk up and down the stairs without extreme pain. There was still a lot of soreness, but not extreme. Monday, 3-29-21. Woke up this morning and can get out of bed without much pain at all. This afternoon I am about 90% back to normal walking, without pain.

This has continued - on and off throughout the day - since then .   I did not see this side effect listed so I&#39;m not positive that it is linked to the vaccine but I tend to think it is as I have never experienced this feeling before.  It is relatively mild and it is not impacting my day-to-day activities, but I definitely feel it.

As the morning the dizziness got worse and had nausea, this continued for 4-5 days before it seemed to get a little better.  It has now been 7 days and although it is better I still have some dizziness.  For the last 4 days I have been taking 2 meclizine.

These symptoms progressively worsened over the course of several days. On day 6 after receiving the vaccine, the patient stated his right leg started dragging and he had a difficult time functioning. The patient drove himself to the ER where he collapsed. A bleed in the brain was subsequently discovered and the patient underwent surgery, where he spent 3 days in the ICU. The patient was later discharged. As of today, the patient states he has resumed normal function

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: Not Reported), via an unspecified route of administration on Arm Right on 18Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included spinal injury, an infection in his scrotum, some neurogenic things, white blood cells (his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine). There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that, the consumer stated, &#34;my wife and me went to hospital and we got a COVID vaccine first one, we had some, my wife had terrible side effects, I am crippled, and I had not it before in Mar2021, she is ok, but she is just sick, I am sick, but she is very sick and she got bad stuffs (rash).&#34; Caller states that both him and his wife were having some side effects, although his wife was having the worse trouble. Caller states that last night, him and his wife were up all night. Caller was up because his wife was up so sick. Caller states that both him and his wife are sick and disabled, that is why they got the shot. Caller reports that he is retired and disabled because he got hurt at work. Caller states that what he is experiencing, is he just feels bad on 18Mar2021. Caller states that he did previously go to a doctor to do a blood study, the doctor is looking for blood diseases or cancer in the caller, and caller thinks that taking the COVID shot just exposed his weak spots. Caller reports that both him and his wife have body aches. Caller was wondering if there was anything, he can go get over the counter at the pharmacy to help. Caller reports that he cannot call his doctor, because they are all out on Fridays. Caller states that him and his wife are not planning to take the second dose of the product. Caller states that they have a lot of hurricanes where they live. Their house got tore up in one, and they sold it to one of their sons, and the caller and his wife moved out to their beach house for a while. He had an infection in his scrotum, something stung him, and that is what the doctors are looking for in him now, because his white blood cell count is high, and he has a rash on his scrotum in Mar2021. It was infected. Caller states that this infection in his scrotum has flared back up since getting the COVID vaccine yesterday, so caller had thought it went away but he guesses it never went away. Caller confirms that the issues with his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine, but the caller thinks that the vaccine was exposing the caller&#39;s weak spots, and maybe that is a god send because it is all flared up now, and the caller will be able to tell his doctor that. Caller states that he has been getting high white blood cell count readings since the stuff with his scrotum first started, and that is why his doctor sent him to an Oncologist for all this blood testing, so maybe this will be a b lessing in disguise for the caller, in finding out what is wrong with him. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Rash covering the majority of my face when I woke up the next day. No hives and did not itch. Red patches and blotches. Not really bothersome. Got a little better every day until it was hard to see any a week later. Momentary dizziness, also the next day, like a three second flash, when rising from laying flat, laying flat from standing or sitting, or rolling over while laying down. Passes and I can sleep and not notice it unless I am awake enough, and cognizant enough, to notice it when I roll over. Once standing and moving about there is no problem except a feeling, I have seen described as brain fog, of being a little off mentally. Not sharp, but no dizziness. Can maintain normal activity that includes bending over, kneeling down, driving and riding in a car without any dizziness. Have tried eply maneuver, something I can do, but have not had any improvement. Brain fog seems to improve with normal daily movement and I have been trying to avoid my normal caffeine intake.

                                                I am current diabetic and have a recent history (1 year ago) of muscular dystrophy. I use a cane to assist with mobility, and cannot lift my legs far to go up high stairs, nor lift my arms past my chest as a baseline.   Later in the evening/middle of the night, after the second shot, I got up around 3:30am to use the rest room and after each step, my knees, legs, hips, and arms gave out,  falling forward on my face and head. I had no strength to catch myself from falling, nor could I lift myself at all. Initially, I could not even roll over. It took 10 minutes with help from my wife to roll over, but I remained on the floor. I was on the bathroom floor/snake crawling for 2 hours trying to figure out ways I can get up, but I had no strength at all. After snake crawling to the bedroom, my wife called the paramedics to get me up at 530am, Tuesday April 6th.    Later that night of the 6th I did a little better, with help  I could sit up in the bed.  Overnight I tried to lift up to stand, and barely could stand, but my legs were too shaky, body bruised of course, and weak.   April 7th, the next day, I was able to sit up. Later that day I was able to get up to go to the bathroom with my wife?s help and the use of a rolling walker with wheels, brakes and a seat, about 3:50am this morning.  I have 35-40% of my strength, and can sit on the side of the bed. I need assistance to the bathroom and I have a ways to go to recover to my baseline.

                                                Around 330 on 4/6, I started feeling bad and arrived home around 530pm and  had a slight Temperature (99) with hearing loss in both ears. But the right one had complete hearing loss. Thinking it would be a short term side effect, but realizing on Thursday am with was not, I called my physician office on Thursday and they called back on Thursday for a Friday 9am appt with the PA. She said it was sinus related , fluid in the ears was pushing the ear drum back and gave me a prescription for Fluticasone and to take my Zyretx and Sudafed. Call her in a week if symptoms did not away. On 4/12/21, I still have massive hearing loss and pain, so called a ENT for an appt and received a 1:15pm on the same day. This  was the first day I had balance issues.

A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Mar2021 14:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma, prediabetic, low thyroid, overweight but not obese, and capillary in the white part of his eye bust (right eye) about 4 months ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). The patient previously took cryproheptadine hydrochloride (CYPRO) and had known allergies. The patient also previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested for COVID post-vaccination. The vaccine facility type was Public Health Department. The patient has no other vaccine in four weeks. On 29Mar2021 at 14:00, it&#39;s been about 2 days and for the first day and a half, the patient experienced the normal flu like symptoms. Now after about two days (29Mar2021 at 14:00), he feel just a little out of it, dazed. Also when he leaned back to put eye drops in his eye, he lost his balance a little which does not normally happen. Also within about 12 hours after taking the vaccine, a capillary in the white part of his eye bust and the left side of his left eye was bloody. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of the events were not recovered.

A 63-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER2613) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 20Mar2021 at 13:15 (63-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included epilepsy and chronic urticaria. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination included lamotrigine, hydroxyzine, and omalizumab (XOLAIR). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Within 8 hours of receiving vaccine (at 21:15 on 20Mar2021), loud tinnitus developed in both ears. Next morning (on 21Mar2021) he had severe sudden sensineural hearing loss in his left ear and vertigo. Seriousness criteria was reported as disability. Receiving steroid injections and oral steroids. Vertigo and tinnitus continue. Adverse events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

No further information is expected.

                                                Patient&#39;s shoulder joints began hurting after vaccine. It kept getting more and more severe, up to the point where he couldn&#39;t raise his arms. He also had some pain in thigh muscles but not as severe. Pain got so severe he went to ER - who did labs and told to see PCP. PCP gave naproxen for pain, which helped some. 3 days later - he went back to ER and he was given a muscle relaxer and IV morphine. He returned  back to PCP  and was given steroids and 2-3 days later had complete relief but still being treated on steroids.

                                                I&#39;ve had both shots.  Issue started after 2nd shot received on 4/20/21 at 11:00 am.  I felt great all that day until I woke up at 1:00 am next day with pain and fatigue of about a 7 on 10 point scale.  That lasted all day and I stayed in bed.  There was less pain and fatigue the following day but instead my heart was racing.  In days since the pain has stopped and fatigue is gone, but I have periods of my heart racing.  Today is 6 days after the second shot almost to the hour.  I feel good at the moment, but did have a short lived episode of heart racing in middle of the night.  Hopefully this is all getting better, but I thought best to report it because everything I&#39;ve read on Internet suggests that the after affects would only be a day or two.

A nurse then placed a BP cuff on me and measured my BP at 185/150. My oxygen level was 98. My face, neck and arms turned very red and my face - cheeks, nose and lips started to swell. They gave me apple juice and crackers. After about 45 minutes, my right arm was normal, the color in my face, neck and arms returned to normal, my BP was 150/90. My cheeks, nose and lips remained swollen. After another hour passed, I felt ok, so I left. I took Zyrtec and then Benadril, but they didn&#39;t help. My doctor prescribed prednisone but took me off of it after 3 days as it had no affect. After a week, the swelling in my cheeks and nose subsided, but as of today 5-6-21 my lips are still swollen.

                                                Extreme flare up of gout.  The worst gout I ever experienced. I can be prone to gout so am familiar with the issue. This began immediately the following morning after the first dose and is still a problem now 3 weeks later.  My entire foot, ankle and lower calf were completely swollen and the foot turned blue.  Finally now 3 weeks later the swelling has reduced to the big toe but I am still limping.  I was schedule for the second dose yesterday and we cancelled. I am very concerned about taking the second dose, especially since we have a wedding trip planned in early June. I can not suffer with this again during that trip and not sure if a  10% increase in immunity from Covid is worth the risk of another major gout flare up like that.  Naturally I am concerned about permanent joint damage also.

                                                Received first vaccine on 3/17/2021 - had mild shoulder pain. Received 2nd dose on 4/6/2021. After second dose I have had severe shoulder pain - both shoulder and mild hip pain on both sides. The shoulder pain is severe enough that I can&#39;t put on my own shirt, coat and trouble with putting on socks due to shoulders leaning forward. Shoulder pain is in the area where shoulder and upper arm connect. I saw a internal medicine physician on 5/7 and he is sending me to sports medicine physicians 5/14 - my pain is not due to an injury, it was mild after first vaccine but has been severe after 2nd vaccine. I am taking no medication besides Aleve before bed but in pain while sleeping and when I get up. Pain is constant when moving shoulder or hips. If I drive for more then 1 hour, my hips are in pain and I need to get out of car and walk around.

                                                He got his vaccine, immediately had dizziness.  Within 30 minutes could not move real good due to the Parkinson&#39;s.  He got more confused, more dizzy, and worsening of his Parkinson&#39;s.   He was very thirsty and drank a lot of water (4 liters of bottled water).  He was then urinating and sweating a lot as a way of his body trying to get rid of something in his body.  He was urinating more than he normally does.  He started getting harder for him to breath.  He noticed he had a bad taste in his mouth similar to when he had the COVID virus.  He got a horrible splitting headache/migraine type that kept coming and going.  He still has the taste in his mouth, and it affected the taste of food.  These were all symptoms similar to when he had COVID.  The headache was worse than when he had the virus.  No appetite still, but still continuing to drink the water and not urinating like you did the first day and a half.  He is not having to drink as much as he did before and not feeling like he was dehydrating.  Does have the soreness from the vaccine or any rashes. He did have chills and low grade fever of about 100-101, which have resolved.  He also had a sore throat which he still has.   He had a very bad case of the COVID virus 3/1/21, which lasted for a week or two.  He still has some residual symptoms from the virus with balancing/dizziness or worsening of his Parkinson&#39;s disease.  His neurologist told him that he would recover from the cognitive effects from the COVID with his Parkinson&#39;s, but his motor skills may not return.

A 63-year-old male consumer (patient) received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EN6198) via an unspecified route of administration into the left arm on 28Feb2021 16:30 (at the age of 63-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included type 2 diabetic. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that he was calling to report a reaction to his first vaccine dose. He had no medical questions at this time and requested to be transferred to safety. 30 calls ahead, caller was agreeable to holding for the safety department. Got COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday afternoon 28Feb2021. Was okay after the fifteen-minute waiting period. Got home and took a nap. On 28Feb2021, the patient woke up at around 6:30 PM, he was feeling a bit nauseous. He drank ginger ale and went back to bed. On 01Mar2021 at around 01:30, he reported of everything hurt and thought he had the flu/ flu symptoms, could not lift left arm, chills, temperature got up to 99.2 and bed sweats where he had to change his bed and t-shirt twice. Never had a fever, but his temperature got up to 99.2. Last time he had the flu was 10 years ago, which was why he thought he must have the flu. Thought it was a coincidence he received his COVID-19 Vaccine and then got the flu. That morning, 02Mar2021, he felt great. On an unspecified date, he reported that his left arm was very swollen from shoulder to his neck, stiff arm and stiff neck, headache, dizziness, muscle and joint aches. Did not know what that was, but glad it was gone. His left arm was the injection arm. Arm was very swollen from his shoulder to neck. He felt his armpit and did not feel like his lymph nodes were swollen. Felt like a stiff neck and stiff arm. Did not have any trouble breathing. Did not have heart palpitations. No prior vaccinations within four weeks. He tested positive for COVID-19 Virus on 01Feb2021 around 4:30PM. Believes it was a PCR COVID-19 test. End of his isolation was 11Feb2021 and he tested negative. Was getting tested for a procedure that was scheduled for 03Feb2021. However, the procedure is now moved to 15Mar2021. No further details provided. Last vaccination was a Tdap and he did not have any problems with that. Tdap was forever ago and has no NDC/Lot/Exp to provide. Would like to speak to a consulting Nurse. Had first dose of covid vaccine and had bad reaction. Has surgery scheduled very close to second dose appointment of vaccine. Clarified surgery was scheduled before first dose of vaccine. Wants to know with having reaction to first dose and being close to surgery, should he get second dose. No unaddressed medical questions referred or forwarded to Medical Information. He was having surgery (hip replacement) on 29Mar2021 and was scheduled for his second Pfizer vaccine on 30Mar2021. Since he had several side effects with the first vaccine dose, he enquired that should he not get the second vaccine dose the day before his scheduled surgery. He was having a heck of a time getting scheduled for his second dose, window was supposed to be 20-25 and he was able to get it scheduled on the 28th, he had a severe reaction to the first dose, night sweats, no fever, but classic flu symptoms, lasted about 24 hours, started on 1:30am Monday morning is when he started having the symptoms. Had shot Sunday afternoon 28Feb2021. He was having a hip replacement on 29Mar2021, will it be a problem if he has another reaction, cannot cancel surgery. First surgery was cancelled because he tested positive for Covid on 01Feb2021, prior to vaccine, tested negative for covid on 11Feb2021, hip issues and surgery were scheduled prior to vaccine. Was it okay for him to get his hip surgery the day after his second dose of the vaccine. Investigation assessment was unknown.

Bloodwork done, EKG showed irregular rythm, referred to cardiologist. Feeling better at time of visit, all additional tests ok. Weeks of extreme fatigue and lightheadness occur for periords lasting 6-24 hours at average. Any major activity would cause debilitating weakeness the next day.

Was going to return if not feeling good, but felt better for 3 days, longest period to date.

This happened on 5/21/2021.  His wife is here giving the history.  Him and his wife have the first Covid injection by Pfizer on 5/21/2021 at 3:30 PM at pharmacy.  Within 2 hours they were back home sitting on the porch relaxing and he had the sudden onset of stroke like symptoms as noted above.  EMS was called.  Apparently by the time EMS arrived he had recovered to baseline and they advised him he did not have to go to the hospital for evaluation if he did not want to apparently.  Since that time he has had no further stroke like symptoms but has continued to feel a bit foggy in the head with a slight dizziness.

                                                Had headache on June 30(day after 2nd Pfizer vaccine injection). Headache became persistent migraine after day 4 and only started  to subside after taking 2 advil tablets per day for about 5 days in a row.  In addition to migraine headache,  general dizziness(lasted almost two weeks now) loss of appetite(lasted week and a half) intermittent pains in stomach active bowels(going to bathroom 4 or 5 times a day rather than once) SEVERE PAIN in left leg which could best be describe as a general Neuropathy(no pain in muscles or bones) - had to take two advil tables on separate nights to relieve pain. After fourth day of this leg pain and having taken the advil, the pain subsided and seems to be mostly cleared up.  NOTE: This leg pain started on July 2(4 days after injection) and lasted 4 days.   NOTES:  I rarely get even mild headaches and never get any of the other symptoms.

My right knee which has been diagnosed with mild arthritis was also particularly painful.  The pain was bad enough that I could not walk without a cane.  I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and had a cup of coffee.  About 30 minutes later the pain had largely subsided, but I was somewhat sore for the rest of the day.  I felt much better the morning of April 3.

A 63-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, batch/lot number and expiry date not reported, age at the time of vaccination: 63-year-old), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Right (shoulder) on 06May2021 13:00 as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Previously the patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot number not reported), in Arm right (shoulder) on 15Apr2021(got about noon time, got it about may be earlier at about 10 am) for covid-19 immunization. The patient did have any vaccination since he was a child. On 06May2021, the patient had the shot in noon right above 1 pm and went home laid down and felt kind of like he did the first time only little better. Actually he felt pretty good and came and laid down for 24 hour period, and on 07May2021, he went to do some laundry at 3 pm, just one &#39;load of sheets&#39; and then came home, and upon coming home in his apartment complex it&#39;s kind of, snakes as come in those left and right kind of and let permit from going fast, so, he come home and pulled in and when he pull in he got this nasty feeling like, but he was looking at the rare view and got 4 cars behind him, and they were really tight behind, but he can&#39;t move any faster and he was not going to speed up just because, and when he was looking at them, at the rare view and forward, and was doing those 3 things, he probably turned around to see and while doing his head just Spun and got the sick feeling and passed out and his head ended up in the passenger seat and bounced up and he think he might have messed up his certain position of neck and had neck issues, and blow the car and wreck his car and it&#39;s in shop right now. And also it caused some massive confusion and he wrecked his car and may have the surgery on neck again because of banging of neck on the seat, it was the bad accident but thank god he didn&#39;t hit anybody. That the only good thing about the whole thing, that nobody else got hurt but I got hurt. He also have to go to 2 emergency rooms. When patient was asked about the lot number and other questions, he asked to slow down as his head was hurting as he just can&#39;t keep up with the caller and it starting to bother him and started to give bad headache but because his brain was working over time. As a corrective therapy, the patient&#39;s doctor has not offered any kind of medication for that occurrence. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number is requested.

                                                Thursday night going into Friday, 4/9/2021, I had some issue with my heart.  Fluctuations ? 3 to 4 rapid beats that felt like they were from the top of my heart followed by a very slow booming 2 beats that felt like they came from the bottom left side of my heart.  I tried coughing to get back into rhythm without success.  Felt light headed but no nausea.  Went and laid on the sofa and put my feet above my head.  Couldn?t stay in that position due to size of the love seat.  This started around 10 PM Thursday and lasted until about 6 AM on Friday.  I finally fell asleep around 6 AM and stayed in bed until around 9 AM.  Got up and putted around the house cleaning, coffee, dressing.  She came home around 10:30 AM and called clinic for an appointment to get an EKG.  We went to clinic at 11:00 AM and were able to get an EKG around 12:30 PM.  All was normal with the EKG.  She brought a double cheese burger for a snack when she picked me up.  No blood pressure was taken, so I purchased a BP machine at store after eating.  When I took my BP around 1:30 PM, it was very low - 90/52.  Later that evening, we made a beef taco dinner (slightly salty).  When I took my BP after dinner settled, it was more normal ? 118/70.

This 63-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Batch/Lot number: EW0161 and expiry date 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 15Ap2021 at 12:00 hours (at the age of 63-year-old) on right arm as dose 1, single and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Batch/Lot number: EW0176 and expiry date 31Aug2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 06May2021 at 12:00 hours (at the age of 63-year-old) on right arm as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included Stomach cancer, 14Feb2021 after being exposed to heavy metals. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Reported he had an adverse reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He said it had been one heck of a ride, and he felt like the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine almost killed him. He passed out behind the wheel (of his 2015 Mitsubishi Eclipse) the day after he had his second Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine, and he knew it was the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot because he felt antsy after he got the vaccine shot. He said he felt antsy after his first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot, too and with his first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot, he was down for a week. Reported his doctor seemed to be the least concerned about him being knocked out. His doctor did not appear to be receptive to what his complaints were after he received his second Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot. His insurance company was aware he was going to change doctors. The patient reported that he collapsed on 14Feb2021 after being exposed to heavy metals, and was hospitalized, stating his primary care doctor had not helped him at all. On an unknown day he felt nauseated. It was reported on 07May2021, the day after his 2nd Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine injection, he felt antsy by the time he got home, threw his body in bed, and was down for a day. He felt nauseated, but (on 07May2021) did some sheets at the laundromat. While coming home he had gotten real dizzy, and passed out. He ended up flooring the gas pedal on his car, and bounding over the curb in his apartment complex&#39;s parking lot. He bounced his head on the front passenger side seat. He clarified he passed out over the center console of his car, and his rib cage went over the car&#39;s center console. His head bounced off of the passenger seat. He said his rib cage was pushed up inside him when it hit the car&#39;s center console, and had to do something to his insides. He said it was a one car accident, and his apartment manager may have the car accident on film. He was looking in three directions and my head just Spun, I get the sick feeling. Reported his car accident caused a tear in his hiatal hernia in his stomach and he needed surgery. Reported his neck was injured. He had follow ups with his doctor since then, and his neck had been getting worse. He felt like something foreign was stuck in his throat, so he went to the Emergency Room (on 22Jun2021). The patient needed to see an endoscopy doctor to be ruled out for stomach cancer. He was told by the Emergency Room doctor that he had a mass in his stomach, and his hiatal hernia needed repair. His hiatal hernia had gotten worse since his car accident. He stated that he went home and laid down after his car accident. He said he felt ok and had his own pain medication to take to help recover from the car accident. He clarified he took Hydromorphone that was prescribed by his pain doctor. He did not have the Hydromorphone , Lot, and Expiry Date. He had an appointment on 23Jul2021 to see doctor for a new Hydromorphone prescription. No further details provided. The patient reported he was concerned about the stomach thing. He recalled his stomach swelled up after his car accident. He tried to take oxygen through a CPAP machine after the car accident to help him feel better and using the CPAP machine was not normal. His CPAP machine worked perfectly before the accident, but now he had a problem, and could not take the CPAP machines pressurized breathing. He now fought to get a breath while the CPAP machine was pushing oxygen in because he was trying to push his breath out at the same time. He felt really weak now, and the CPAP had helped all along. I did passed out behind to wheel of my car and &#39;it doesn&#39;t stopped&#39;(Further not clarified) and I didn&#39;t have any information to you because all the information I had is in back of my car. The first shot I was given 09Apr2021 no 15Apr2021 looks like, I think this was she said worked down 15Apr2021 (Further not clarified), second shot I received on May 6, but on 07May2021 at 5 pm I just passed out upon pulling into my Apartment complex and the snakes you known &#39;just slow you down&#39;(Further not clarified) you know of course I didn&#39;t have any problems to slow down but there were 4 cars behind me, I am looking at the cars, I am looking at the rare view and I am looking ahead of me to make sure , you know I am following &#39;snake&#39; and everything&#39;s being cool and I am been forced to go fast what I mean I was driving car but I was looking to those 3 different areas my head just Spun, I get the sick feeling and passed out and my head ended up in the passenger seat and bounced up and I think I might have messed up my certain position of my neck and I had neck issues, that happened on 07May2021, the day after the second Covid shot, I think if I had not gotten, if I stayed down may be the thing better but First time I got the first shot, it was 3 months the same thing I felt the same like I have to be really careful you know what I did, if I did it (Further not clarified, hence event not captured ).

He went to numerous doctors. He didn&#39;t have the flu. They weren&#39;t sure what he had. They gave him ibuprofen (MOTRIN) to take. He also had a really bad sinus infection. In Mar2020, he had really bad problems with his eye. His right eye could only move halfway towards his nose. It would not move to the right the all. Then his left eye was twisted. His mouth tasted sour. He does not taste food. This was all prior to receiving the vaccine. Concomitant medication included gabapentin from an unspecified date 6 years ago and ongoing for nerves.

The next day was concerning. On Saturday, 16Jan2021, he had a fever of 101.3, bad headaches like migraines, watery mouth, the back of his neck was stiff and sore, and his body ached and felt funny. He had no appetite and had to force himself to eat as nothing tasted good (16Jan2021). He was scheduled to take the second dose. He was unsure if it was 21 or 22 days after the first one.  He asked if he should get the second dose. The clinical outcome of felt woozy, chills, fever 101.3 was recovered on 17Jan2021.

It is apparent that the hypodermic needle punctured the rotator cuff and bottomed out onto bone (&#34;twinge&#34; felt upon point of full insertion and upon injection).  The injection site was too high on the upper arm (just below the subacromial space - I have photos with the location marked).  Additionally, the 1-1/2 inch long hypodermic needle was fully inserted without manipulating the muscle to raise its height.  The above was confirmed by examination by Doctor.         Pain and diminished range of motion still evident, but somewhat subsiding as of 11:00PM 2-15-2021 (55 hours after onset).

Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before. He said he had chicken pox as a young adult, and he only had 1 spot of chicken pox. He had never had dry eyes before. Reporter seriousness for fever, UTI, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness, rash, shingles were medically significant. For other events were unspecified. The outcome of event injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness was recovered on 31Jan2021, dry eye, tiredness was not recovered, while the outcomes of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known possible local reaction, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of injection site pain, redness, and puffiness cannot be excluded. The other events are considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to the use of BNT162B2.

I went to local doctor and he prescribed additional BP meds. BP now good (126/80) but I still experience dizziness from time to time. Yesterday when BP high I also had constant headache and some nausea. Today(3/12), almost week after shot I still experience dizziness to a minor degree off and on, but still somewhat severe when lying down, looking up, and bending over

                                                I had no adverse effects at the time of the vaccination and the day was uneventful but I got a small headache early in the evening on the left side of my head/neck.  I ignored it.  By bedtime 10/11 PM Thursday night I had pain in my neck on the right side that felt like I had been in a bad car accident.  By 4 O&#39;clock in he morning the pain was almost unbearable.  I got up and did an hour of stretching and it became bearable.  I had finally taken a  8 MG HYDROMORPHONE tablet just before 4 AM that the doctor had given me last summer for falling over a pile of lumber and landing on my back on a 4 x 4 board.  That helped some.    Ever since then, the pain in my neck has gone from a 4/10 to a 9/10 in pain and the headaches have clustered on the left side of my head.  The worst ones are just below my left ear.   It is now Saturday night and the neck pain is not as bad but it is not gone either,  It still hurts to turn my head, cough or when I get up or down.  I did not do anything physically to cause this.

                                                No treatment.  I had a cardiac ablation in the fall because of chronic atrial fibrillation. It appeared to have worked. One day after receiving the vaccination I took a walk with some hills and had what I believe was a mild episode of atrial fibrillation. I verified as best I could, using a pulse oximeter.  I feel fine for the most part, but a little bit tired and dizzy. I do not plan to call the doctor unless things get worse.

                                                I had the Pfizer vaccine, 1st and 2nd. The first one gave me the reaction most people say the 2nd one gives, although not quite as bad as what others have described. HOWEVER, the 2nd dose in my case, cause a severe flare-up of arthritic type symptoms in my joints, mostly both knees but no feverish reactions. When I say severe arthritic flare up, I mean debilitating to the point where it almost hurts too much to walk. I had the shot on a Friday, the arthritic pain began late that night and became worse on Saturday. It is now Monday and the pain has only subsided a little bit. It&#39;s still difficult to get up from a sitting position and to walk or stand for longer periods of time.

He could hardly carry the groceries to the car. He also had wobbliness. On 11Mar2021, the patient fell down and passed out coming home that night and he had blood all over him. He later clarified that he did not pass out, he got into the house and fell down and somehow landed on the recliner. He was covered in blood and all kinds of stuff. On 11Mar2021, he could not sleep at all that first night and his prescription Melatonin (Manufacturer Rugby) 3mg did not help at all. The falling down occurred roughly that same night on 11Mar2021. The patient stated that they told him they thought he was having seizures again but he was not. He had imaging which showed no seizures and Xray of his brain with unknown results in Mar2021.

The patient was scheduled to return for the second dose 01Apr2021.  The patient inquired if he should get the second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of events kidney stone, blood all over him, could not sleep at all and wobbliness was unknown. The outcome of events sweating and falling down was recovered on 11Mar2021 and no appetite was recovered in Mar2021. The outcome of no energy was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

That continued to progress to include a 102 fever, aggressive chills, nausia, no appetite and muscle weakness.  The symptoms continued, especially the muscle weakness, to the point that by the afternoon of the 12th, I was unable to get up from a chair or navigate stairs on my own.  I was really unable to sleep.  By the afternoon of the 13th, the muscle weakness subsided to the point that I could get out of a chair and navigate on my own, not well, but on my own.  Symtoms continued to decline by the afternoon of the 14th.  Symptoms continued to improve by the afternoon of the 14th that I could return to computer work.

The joint pain continued to progress.  He has constant pain.  He contacted Labs to have blood work.  The blood work showed the protein levels at 48% which is why he was having so much inflammation in his joints.  The RA test was normal.  Pt will be going to an Urgent Care since he is still in so much pain and the symptoms are not getting any better.  He was very active and now has trouble moving around.  Mobility is down 25 to 30%  compared to 100%.

A 64-years-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; ), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 02Apr2021 (at the age of 64 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: ER8733) as 1st SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included severe sleep apnea from 18Mar2021 (received a machine not long after),  gout (diagnosed about four years ago) , ex-tobacco user from an unknown date to an unknown date (two pack a day smoker over thirty years).

It was reported the patient experienced hypoacusis and has a new hearing aid on an unspecified date. Caller says her husband has new hearing aids, which is why he is not doing the report himself.  Patient has a spot on his lung that they are monitoring  on an unspecified date.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: results unavailable on an unspecified date , &#39;they did a couple tests&#39; (details not provided)  results unavailable on 02Apr2021, urine analysis: results unavailable on an unspecified date.

The clinical course was reported as follows on April 2nd her husband received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

He started to get out again then halfway out the door he fainted and fell down on the ground. She says he was out for, 5-10 minutes, clarified to not even a minute. Since he hit his head she called an ambulance, and they took him to PRIVACY in PRIVACY. They  did a couple tests and said since it was so soon after getting the vaccine that they did not think the vaccine had to do with his blood clots. Caller also stated he fainted because that was one of the side effects of the vaccine, but they were glad he got there since he had several blood clots in his lungs. On the same day (02Apr2021) he had a thrombectomy to remove the blood clots and put him on a blood thinner. Patient was admitted to the hospital April 2nd and was discharged April 4th. He  is doing better, he is on a blood thinner now. She says there were a few doctors that had to weigh in on whether he should get the second dose, they decided it wouldn&#39;t affect it since the vaccine goes into his muscle.  No  other vaccinations on the same days as his Pfizer COVID-19 vaccinations or during the four weeks prior.  Once they placed him on a blood thinner, they took him off Colchicine 0.6mg.  He stopped taking Colchicine because they said the blood thinner doesn&#39;t work with that particular medication.  It was also reported The patient is to schedule an appointment with a  rheumatologist and a hematologist, they did blood work and a urine test and said he has a spot on his lung that they are monitoring. The clinical outcome of the event blood clots in his lungs was Recovered/Resolved with Sequel while the remaining events was unknown. The  second dose bnt162b2 was administered on April 29th. LOT: ER8751, caller hopes that is a 5, the writing is very bad on there. The patient had no side effects from his second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

A 64-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 17May2021 (at the age of 64-year-old, Batch/Lot Number: EW0177) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included was walking pneumonia twice and other than that just a typical flu. The patient races dirt bikes so he was tough. Also, he had carpel tunnel from his job, and he had left over pain pills from that, and he had been taking them to help reduce the pain since he cannot really do anything about his side effects. Concomitant medication included pain pills, no other products reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 26Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0162) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and on an unspecified date in Apr2021, experienced muscle stiffness and soreness that was in left arm and around his buttocks and his thighs and reported felt soreness for a few days afterward. This report is not related to study or programme. It was reported that, honestly, he wishes he never got it because he cannot do anything. He was on the fence about getting it since we are at the end of the pandemic and the hospitals are not as overwhelmed anymore. Everyone thinks that he was still in his 50&#39;s, he was very healthy, and he has no medical or health issues and he works out all the time, which was why he was so concerned about why it was affecting him like this. He has had his second dose of the COVID vaccine, and he wanted to report what was going on with his body. It was reported that, then he got the 2nd dose and within a day or two he was sore, and he was at the 11th day of experiencing this. He was sore and tight on his upper body like his chest, both arms, his shoulder blades, biceps, triceps, lower neck muscles and on his shoulder blades behind him. He had his 2nd dose not last Monday but the Monday before that. It did dissipate during the day. He jokingly said it was like the Pfizer vaccine retreats and hides during the day. Because of this he has had no decent sleep for the last few nights. His shoulder aches like someone took a bat and hit it. It feels like that on his left arm too but a little less pain. He was a side body sleeper, and he cannot sleep on his side because of this so then he ends up sleeping on his back with his mouth wide open which then makes him dehydrated of course. he has no energy, and the pain was like it was hitting a nerve where he barely can pick up 5 pounds. This was an extending issue and he just wanted to report and see if anyone else has had this before. The hospital said that they have not had anyone else report this before. It was slowly dissipating but he did not understand why it reinforces itself in the evening. Yesterday, he had to go service a customer and he was moving so slow and had lower back and thigh tightness. His upper body was sore and tight so when he got home, he was walking around trying to get his blood flowing and stretching some but then in the middle of the night those reserves came out and he gets attacked. The stiffness, soreness and pain were all concentrated mostly on his upper body. Also, his neck pops and he has never had that happen before. He looked it up and it looks like it was something with air in his bloodstream or something and when he rotates his head and looks around it makes a pop sound, and it has been doing it ever since his 2nd shot. He says this started probably on 18May2021 right after the vaccine. The patient clarified that for the side effects after his second dose that began soon after the COVID vaccine and he states that it was like all hell broke loose. This has gotten a little bit better but not a lot. Maybe 10% better or maybe 15% better. As he was sitting there his shoulder area on the right side was a little bit in pain. He feels like he was 80 years old, he was walking slow, and his body was stiff. No further details provided on the pain pills. He says he was flexing his bicep and he has some pain and there was pain in his triceps. He also has pain between those muscles, it hurts. It was maybe where he had the COVID vaccine. He also has this same pain on the left side except his bicep doesn&#39;t hurt but his tricep does and it hurts from his elbow down to his shoulder and it aches. On a scale of 1-10 his pain was at a 3-4 but at night it was worse. The patient and health care professional consent to be contacted was reported as yes. Investigation assessment was reported as no. The outcome of the events Sleep deficit, oral disorder, dehydration, hypokinesia, feeling abnormal was unknown and for all other events recovering.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                I began to jerk periodically about 12hrs after receiving shot.  I would drop whatever I was holding, cups I of water, juice, then when changing oil. Finally had to hold things with both hands. Then just stayed in my room. When I would type on laptop, if for example,  I would type my name,  it would end up being the wrong name by the time I could lift my hand due to involuntary jerking of my hands. It is now 48 hours after shot and I still have some effects but am cleaning them up on this message so you can read it. And no, I have never taken too much or too little of my own medication and had such a reaction. Neither have I had any recent chance in medication. The only thing different was the pfizer shot 12 hours earlier.

                                                one week after the 2nd shot of Pfizer vaccine, I developed stiff neck such that I cannot turn my head beyond my shoulder and have difficulty to turn my head when driving and changing lanes.  two days later, my lower back pain re-occured after being pain free for more than a few years.   I let the both pain to recover by itsself but the recovering process of the back pain is quite different from my past experience; the back pain last for more than 3-4 weeks until I feel freely to move around.

I was having difficulty walking because I was in so much pain.  I was having a lot of joint related issues. I received cortisone shots in my knees from my doctor. Within a week, things started to get a little better. I still have some difficulty walking, but I could currently stand without help.

A 64-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via unspecified route in arm single dose for COVID-19 immunization on unknown date at 64-year-old. The patient medical history included paranoia. He was an easily over sensitive dude. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was really incapacitated. His joints were swollen. He couldn&#39;t move. He was freezing and was hot and cold all night. Tuesday it was hot and he was outside on the deck in a hoodie and was freezing. His voice didn&#39;t sound like he normally did. It sounded like he smoked four packs a day. His lymph nodes had large balls like an egg on his neck. He won&#39;t go to the doctor or emergency room and he was scared. The patient wanted to commit suicide, just said that four days ago. It was not an emergency at this time. The patient was getting suicidal thoughts, but that was part of his paranoia anyway. He felt like he was being used as a test victim. His mind went nuts because he was paranoid, it was before he received the vaccine. Maybe the patient would take enough time to breathe and have logic to seep into his brain. All symptoms started immediately and were all ongoing. The reporter confirmed that by symptoms he was referring to &#39;his friend&#39;s joints being swollen&#39;, &#39;freezing, hot and cold all night&#39;, &#39;sounded like he smokes four packs a day&#39;, &#39;lymph nodes were large balls like an egg on his neck&#39;. Outcome of the events getting suicidal thoughts and really incapacitated/ can&#39;t move was unknown, outcome of the other events was not resolved.

I talked to my doctor and they advised that I should go to the ER and I went to the ER and they diagnosed me with vertigo. My balance was completely off. He did give me medicine for the dizziness. He advised to have a follow-up.

                                                Two days after receiving the 2nd shot, began to experience inflammation and pain in joints from head to toe. These both have been debilitating, hard to move around, hard to get out of bed, hard climb stairs, hard to use hands due to swelling, hard turn head and cannot kneel down. Life has become very hard and painful. Gabapentin was prescribed and did nothing. My doctor prescribed celecoxib for the pain and inflammation. I&#39;ve only been using it for 3 days and am having moderate relief, but too soon to tell.

I had my yearly Cardiac Dr appointment, which was done virtually,  on 4/15/2021.  I mentioned the difficulty breathing during exercise and he ordered Pulmonary CT and chest xray on 4/16/2021.  The testing showed I had multiple blood clots in both lungs and was immediately admitted to the Emergency Room where I had a negative Covid test and started me on blood thinners.  I was admitted to the hospital and discharged on 4/18/2021.  I was placed on Xarelto for a minimum of 6 months, and to follow up with my Pulmonary Dr in 3 months.

                                                For informational purposes, I am a health care provider myself. I have been experiencing severe episodes of vertigo, starting approximately 1 week after receiving my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and only when lying in bed. They occur a few times per night, and have occurred essentially every night since they started. They are very intense, but also very short in duration, of about 3-5 seconds. When I called my primary care physician to see if she had any thoughts, or suggestions, or if she thought it could be due to the vaccine, she informed me that she also had the same reaction, severe vertigo, while lying in bed, at about the same time period, 1 week after her first injection, although she just had 2 isolated episodes of it, and she had the Moderna vaccine. Neither of us have seen any published information listing this as a side effect of the vaccine.

He could answer questions from the nurses but would respond really slowly. He received the shot on his right arm then he went to stand in the nurse window. Around 10 minutes later, we heard a thud and glass fall down and saw that he had fallen on the floor. His eyes were open and he was responsive. He had the same slow demeaner. He said that his legs felt weak so he fell. The paramedics were called and the staff nurse told them that he had fallen about 10 days ago. He had no issues with his first Covid dose. The paramedics took him to the nearest hospital.

I remained unconscious for approximately 30 seconds. My blood pressure reading was 136/82 approximately 10 minutes after the incident. This apparent vagal syncope was the first I have experienced. Had I been operating a motor vehicle, I would have crashed the vehicle as the blackout was instantaneous. I visited my PCP on 2-17-21. He checked my blood pressure and performed an EKG and both were normal. He has requested appointments with a cardiologist and a neurologist.

Around 8:15 / 8:20am I began feeling very dizzy and unable to stand up on my own. I couldn&#39;t walk down the hallway without holding onto the wall. This went on all day, long after the effects of the Bayer Back &amp; Body would have worn off . Even at dinner time I was uneasy / unstable walking around. The only time I felt well was when I was lying in bed. By the next morning, Wednesday the 24th, I wasn&#39;t 100% that morning either but I went to work and did the work. It was very difficult but by afternoon I was feeling much better. It wasn&#39;t until Thursday that I was feeling 100%. I had never felt this way in my life. No it was not Epilepsy related and I had been taking Bayer Back &amp; Body FOR YEARS without problem except maybe taking two, occasionally would feel the caffeine.

                                                Patient received his first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 3/3/21. Patient was conscious with no apparent issues after administration. Patient was asked to sit down for 15-minute observation afterwards. A few minutes later patient was swaying back and forth in his chair and saying he was feeling faint. I repeatedly addressed patient by his first name and asked if he could hear me and repeatedly asked if he was okay. Patient began slumping down in his chair but was still conscious. Patient was not responsive but made eye contact with me. Patient requested water. After giving patient water and observing him drink he began looking nauseous and threw up. Patient then passed out in his chair. I supported the patient upright in his chair and made sure he did not fall down or injure his head. I then immediately tapped him on both shoulders and repeatedly called his name. Patient then became responsive and 911 was called. While waiting patient said he was starting to feel better and was able to support himself in his chair. I did not observe any injuries due to fainting. When the ambulance came patient agreed to be taken to the hospital.

He ultimately required supplemental oxygen and breathing increasingly became labored. Patient ultimately died on 4/9/21.

He had a possible bacterial superinfection.  His procalcitonin was elevated.  We therefore treated him with antibiotics for the bacterial superinfection, and treated him with convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone for his Covid infection.  Patient is doing much better now.  He is breathing well on room air and feels ready to go home.  Physical and Occupational Therapy saw him and they recommended home health at discharge.  We are talking to the patient about whether he prefers to go to a inpatient rehabilitation facility versus home with home health.  That is still up in the air at this moment we will follow whenever pathway is most appropriate.   The patient did have some elevated liver function test on admission but these are better at the time of discharge.  He also has continuous narcotic dependence and is getting frequent opioids.  This is keeping his chronic back pain under control.   On the day of discharge the patient is feeling very good and is eager for discharge.

A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6203) as 0.3 ml single for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at vaccination was 65 years old. Medical history included hyperlipidemia and high cholesterol. Historical vaccine included 1st dose of BNT162B2 (LOT: EL3247) on 03Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. Concomitant medication included pravastatin (strength: 10 mg) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. Reporter did not know all of the symptoms that the patient had and cannot get the history, because the patient&#39;s mental status was altered (from unknown date in 2021). It was reported that he was having symptoms for at least 2 weeks with some increasing over the last 2 weeks. Knew that he had an overall imbalance and was having headaches, both from unknown date in May2021. He had been having symptoms for weeks and went to his doctor as an outpatient. He had initial imaging that was concerning and he went to the hospital because he had a decline (from unknown date in 2021). He had declined and had a hemorrhagic hemorrhage with cerebral venous thrombosis, both from 04Jun2021. He was admitted to the hospital 04Jun2021, and 05Jun2021 he was transferred to the ICU. He had declined since his initial presentation and had been kind of getting worse over the last couple of weeks. Stated the patient was stoic and does not have a lot of medical problems, but everyone knew he was having symptoms over the last 2 weeks. 02Jun2021 he had the worst symptoms and was basically having balance problems. He was getting concerned and had called to get an appointment with his primary care physician. They had done an outpatient CT scan which found the cerebral venous thrombosis and he went to the hospital and was placed on Heparin. While in the hospital, he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and had further decline on 04Jun2021. Repeat imaging showed that he had bilateral intracerebral hemorrhaging, the left greater than the right, and they had expanded a bit. He was still on heparin and now (Jun2021) had some cerebral edema due to it but was not on a ventilator. He was still in the time period where he was continuing to have small declines. He was therapeutic on heparin. He had a central line and was getting hypertonic saline for the brain swelling and cerebral edema. Patient previous health condition was reported as he did not have a real significant past medical history. He maybe carried a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia and high cholesterol. He was pretty healthy; regularly went to the doctor and was otherwise pretty stable. Reporter did not even think his LDL was that high. He had never been on any blood thinners or anything like that. They did a full scan to look for cancer and had no history of blood clots. They did a scan that was negative for any types of masses or any concerns for cancer. His prostate was enlarged (from unknown date in 2021) and they had spoken to the family about it and they said he had been worked up with a biopsy which had been negative. Physician Office? Yes, He was directly admitted to the hospital from primary care. He presented to the clinic because he had these symptoms and headaches. The imaging was done and then he was admitted. He never went through the emergency room. Cerebral venous thrombosis, bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage, overall imbalance/having balance problems, he had a decline, headaches resulted in Physician Office Visit. Outcome of cerebral venous thrombosis, bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage was not resolved; outcome of tonic-clonic seizure, brain swelling/cerebral edema, headache, overall imbalance/having balance problems, he had a decline, kind of getting worse/ had the worst symptoms, enlarged prostate and mental status was altered was unknown. Causality: Cerebral venous thrombosis: Can&#39;t say for sure because reporter does not know the timeline but can&#39;t find any other reason, he would have cerebral venous thrombosis.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, tonic-clonic seizure, and brain swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

Examination and blood tests showed sudden elevation of blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, throid, liver and kidney values, all of which subsequently decline and returned to usual levels after treatment and release from hospital (02/24/2021).  Arrythmia has not been detected since and other measurement/blood indicators are back down/under control.  Only residual symptoms are  slight loss of speed of operation f/righ arm/hand and confirmed &#34;moderate leakage in both heart valves&#34;.

                                                So, I started to have some epidermis outbreaks about a week after the second vaccine. Shortly, after that I had a poison ivy reaction, but this reaction was different in which it started to go, which is odd for poison ivy. I was having an overaction to certain irritants as well. I also would have an abnormal amount of warts that were showing up. I have a lot of epidermis outbreaks. I also have had terrible joint pains also which started a week after the second dose. I was not able to lift things or do normal activates. I am still having trouble with my joints.

A 66-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for Injection, Batch/Lot number: EW0169) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm on 14Apr2021 around 15:00 to 15:30 as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation, patient was diagnosed years ago, before his stroke in 2015, a long time ago, cardiac failure congestive, aortic valve disease, cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, last year patient had a blood infection, so he had to take four antibiotics. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) taken for atrial fibrillation. It was reported that patient received the first dose of the vaccine in mid-April and got sick 2 days later(18Apr2021). Patient had a fever of 104. Caller took him to the doctor and patient was diagnosed sepsis. Patient was in the hospital and was then tested for and diagnosed with Endocarditis due to the sepsis. Patient was currently in a rehab facility and was weak. The rehab facility wanted to give patient the second dose of the covid vaccine. But the rehab facility was not sure if they will get the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was worried about patient getting a second dose of anything. This was not the first-time patient has had endocarditis. Patient has been diagnosed with it before. Patient has a history of congestive heart failure, a bad aortic value, past stroke, and diabetes. They do not know if patient still had endocarditis, but patient has completed the antibiotics. They are unable to test patient again for endocarditis because he is in such bad shape. Patient had one side that was weak, and then he fell and broke his hip. Patient was not a candidate for open heart surgery because of his enlarged heart. Before patient received the first dose of the covid vaccine, patient was sleeping all the time and reporter thought it was due to the sepsis. The doctor told reporter that the sepsis was there before patient got the first dose of the covid vaccine. Patient has A-Fib and takes Eliquis. It was reported that patient had a stroke while he was in the hospital. Patient fell because of the weakness from his stroke. The second fall put him back in the hospital. Patient was in poor shape; his blood sugar was in the 600s. Before patient went to the hospital, he was sleeping all of the time, and he lost his appetite. They did not know if patient still has endocarditis because he could not have the follow up procedure done because he was in bad shape. Patient had weakness and fell and broke his hip. Patient was currently in rehab for physical therapy. Reporter clarifies that she took patient to the emergency room, and then he was admitted to the hospital. Patient&#39;s fever did not start out at 100 degrees, it gradually went up to 104 degrees. By the second or third day, patient&#39;s fever got up to 104 degrees. Reporter is back to square one for help. Reporter is asking if there is anyone who would know what to do. Patient&#39;s cardiologist said for patient to get the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter knows that no one had that in the clinical trial. Before the covid vaccine, patient was having a crown done in his mouth. Last year patient had a blood infection, so he had to take four antibiotics. Reporter thinks they were called amoxicillin, and they were 500mg each. Patient had to take them all at once as a preventive. Patient is on a lot of things, that reporter does not even know. Patient has had a lot of things done to his heart. Patient has had to have ablations. Patient has a very bad heart. Patient has a question about herself. She had the covid vaccine and had no reactions. She is on Celebrex 200mg. Reporter stopped taking a day and a half before the covid vaccine. Reporter is asking if she could have messed herself up by taking an anti-inflammatory, and if taking Celebrex could have prevented her from getting the full effect. Prior to taking Covid vaccine her husband has had Endocarditis, congestive heart failure, bad heart valve and a stroke. 1st dose of vaccine mid-April. 2 days later had a fever of 104 and was admitted to the hospital with sepsis. The sepsis caused endocarditis again. Husband is in rehab facility, and they want him to take a second dose. Should he be getting 2nd dose of Pfizer or a different Covid vaccine. Wife wondering if husband should get 2nd dose at all. Reporter does not think that this has anything to do with the covid vaccine, since they know which bacteria caused it. Reporter thinks that maybe patient getting the first dose of the covid vaccine put patient over the edge. This is the second time that patient has had vegetation, the first time was last year. Reporter thinks that all of patient&#39;s doctors are panicking over the covid vaccine. Reporter knows that patient is in bad shape. In the clinical trial, there was nothing in there about congestive heart failure, or nothing about endocarditis. Patient may still have endocarditis. Reporter does not know what will happen to patient if he gets the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter states that unfortunately patient does not go to the best cardiologist. Reporter thinks that patient is so bad off, that he could be on palliative care. The only reason reporter waited so long to call Pfizer is because patient is in rehab now, and they might be getting in the Pfizer covid vaccine. They asked reporter if she wanted patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. They should get them in on 16Jul2021. Reporter said yes, about a week ago, but it has been on her mind to call and ask the source. Reporter took patient to the hospital, and the doctors diagnosed him with sepsis: Patient was not willing to go to the hospital at first. Patient could not get out of bed. Patient was not eating or drinking. Reporter was trying to give him stuff. Reporter is not a scientist. An infectious disease doctor told reporter that patient already had sepsis before the covid vaccine. Patient was in terrible shape. Patient had a stroke while he was in the hospital. They figured out he had a stroke about five days after being in the hospital. After the stroke, patient had two weeks of physical therapy there. Dates of Hospitalization: He was in the hospital for a few weeks. Patient was home for two days he fell because of the weakness from his stroke. The second fall put him back in the hospital. Patient had to get a partial hip replacement. For about a week now, patient has been in rehab. Patient has A-Fib, since the stroke, he is not on Eliquis. Patient was not on Eliquis before. Patient also has hypertension, but it is under control. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of endocarditis and fell and broke his hip. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Medical history included Covid-19: he tested positive for COVID and received the monoclonal antibody, bamlanivimab on 13Dec2020; other unspecified health conditions which might make him high risk. The patient previously received monoclonal antibody 17-1a, bamlanivimab on 13Dec2020. For Covid-19. The patient received other unspecified medications in two weeks. On 28Dec2020 21:00, 3 hours after vaccination, he was feeling bad with flu-like symptoms, nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue and diarrhea. No treatment received. Covid was not tested post vaccination. The outcome of events was not recovered.  His colleague now knows he should have waited 90 days after the antibody but reporter was wondering if there was information.

Patient stated they were also having breathing difficulties. Immediately tested patients bloods pressure. Tested twice and came to 220/120 with heart rate 80. Was an emergent situation. Informed patient I was contacting 911 to have them take him to the hospital as this is an emergency situation. Went and made phone call. Had staff bring patient into waiting area so that we could monitor him if something worsened. 911 advised to just monitor the patient. If he began vomiting or passed out to have him on his side, so he doesn&#39;t choke from vomit. We monitored patient until ambulance arrived. They asked for current medications we knew of (listed in report) and that he had received Pfizer Covid vaccine 0.3ml resulting in emergency BP readings of 220/120 after receiving.  Ambulance took patient to Hospital. Current condition unknown or if anything even occurred after that point. Whole event lasted about 1 hour before patient left with medical personnel.

Observation staff alerted onsite medical professionals and MD and the crash cart was brought to the car. Vitals were taken. Within a minute pt became responsive and opened his eyes and began to communicate with healthcare staff. O2 sat was noted to be low so O2 was applied at 6L/min via facemask. Onsite Batallion Chief stated he had already called EMS and they were en route. MD remained at the vehicle with pt and continued to monitor until EMS arrived and assumed care. EMS  did an EKG and pt found to have sinus brady, with a pulse in the 50&#39;s. EMS decided to transport pt to hospital for further evaluation. Pt transported to ambulance via stretcher in stable condition, alert.

I started to hallucinate mid day and had fever dreams that inhibited sleep. No treatment was given.

                                                My wife &amp; I are unsure if what we both are experiencing is just coincidental or actually the cause as a result of the 2nd dose shots we both received but we are both experiencing similar events approximately a week&#43; after the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Her information is as follows: Pt age 64, same address &amp; contact information as listed for myself, 1st Pfizer dose 2/6/21 EL9264, 2nd dose 3/1/21 EN6202. We had no immediate event after both shots except for soreness in upper arms at injection sight and this ceased after approximately a day. But as mentioned at a week&#43; of 2nd dose we both started having a severe aching pain. Her pain is in her right knee. My aching pain is in my right hip down my leg to my knee &amp; chin/calf area. It was very difficult to put weight on the leg to walk. We have been icing the areas and taking pain over the counter medication Aleve which has helped somewhat but we are still experiencing as of the date of this submission.  It seems strange we both are experiencing similar issue at approximately the same time.  Coincidence?  Due to reaction to the vaccine?  We are submitting this report to see if it might be and if others have experienced this issue. We are unaware of any physical activity  we may have done during this time to have caused this pain to start occurring. Thank you for any response.

                                                First I have not suffered any injury since getting the vaccine.Arm and shoulder area has increased in pain until heat was applied on March 10, 2021. Next day pain was increased and range of motion declined. By Friday, March 12th I could not raise arm more than 6 inches. Went to the Dr. on 3/12/21 and was referred to the Orthopaedics. Saw PA on 3/12/21. Xrays were taken I believe the diagnosis is in part subacromial bursitis.. Received Cortisone shot. Range of motion was much improved and has stayed about the same through today. Iced shoulder last night because of mild pain. Woke up in considerable pain which has continued today. I have iced the shoulder and upper arm at other times also since 3/10/21.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

I could hardly sleep all night from pain and aches. The next morning I had a hard time using my legs and could hardly lift anything, that lasted all day wednesday into thursday. Thursday the pain lessened and the weakness became less but I started getting pain in my hips and  heavy painful bloating feeling in my intestinal area. That lasted all day and into Friday (today). Today (Friday) the pain in my arms subsided, legs got  better (no pain but still weak) but the intestinal issues are keeping me incapacitated and the top of my hips ache.

                                                Friday April 2, 2021 ? Got Phizer COVID shot at noon.  No reactions that day  Saturday 4/3 ? Woke up to body aches, fatigue, and sweats.  Fever of 100.4 most of the day. ? Stayed in bed and slept until 6:00.  Did not eat or drink much today. ? Felt dizzy when I got up.  Drank water and had 2 bananas and ½ a bowl of chicken soup. ? Felt the same all day.    Easter Sunday 4/4  ? Felt better but still fatigued.  Body aches were not as bad, and temp was normal. ? Drank a lot more water and had a little to eat in the morning. ? Kids came over for Easter Brunch.  We ate about 11:00. ? Whenever I stood up quickly, I got very dizzy.  Happened quite a few times throughout the day (I never had this problem before). ? When walking into the kitchen from outside, I got very dizzy and could not get up the steps on my own, I just kind of stopped.  Did not black out but felt close.  The kids helped me in, and I sat down.   ? Drank more water and took it easy. ? The kids left about 2:00.  Before they left, friend told me to go to a fire station and have my blood pressure checked. ? 2nd friend took me to 3 fire stations before we found one open, south of hardware store? They were nice, took my blood pressure, oxygen level and an EKG. ? They thought I was experiencing A-FIB.  Told me to go to the emergency room right away.  Wanted me to go by ambulance but I told them 2 friend could take me.  They recommended medical center , which was better equipped for this.   ? Got to the emergency room about 4:30 and checked in. ? Nurse checked me out and asked a lot of questions.  I gave her the EKG print out from the fire station.   ? She had us go back to the waiting area and was going to talk with the doctor.  ? After a while they took us back to emergency ward and plugged in a saline bag and monitor.   ? They hooked me up to an EKG machine again and took a reading. ? The doctor. came in and diagnosed me with A-FIB and discussed what it is, what can happen and how to treat it. She said that this could be a temporary episode of A-FIB or it could be permanent. ? She put me on a blood thinner and had me make an appointment with my cardiologist, Dr.    Monday 4/5: ? Felt better got dizzy a couple of times but drank a lot of water and ate. ? Finally got the blood thinner prescription at about 4:00.  Tuesday - Friday: ? Kept drinking a lot of water.  No real issues with dizziness.

Long time delays occurred while scheduling further testing (CT and MRI). Summary from MRI:  &#34;Study Result Impression:  There is diffusion restriction along the left thalamus consistent with subacute ischemia, greater than 6 hours in etiology but less than 2 weeks.&#34;  Outcome:  Vision is slowly improving, headache is mostly gone, vertigo &amp;  mental status slowly improving.

                                                I was going up and down a ladder while painting the eves. I bent over trying to catch my breath with my hands on my knees.My wife who is a nurse said that&#39;snot normal and we need to go to the hospital. While driving there I felt a tingling in my entire body and thought I was going to pass out. We got to the hospital and they hooked me up to a monitor.  My heart beats were super low and jumping all over the place throwing PVC&#39;s. It showed my rate going down to 28 beats and then back up to 60 and down again.It was all over the board. They decided to keep me overnight for observation and tests. Saturday night they drew blood twice to run tests and took urine samples.  Here is the list of tests, doctor and dates:  NM STRESS TEST 1/2 (RADIOLOGY) , MD Apr 12, 2021 Imaging NM STRESS TEST 2/2 (CARDIOLOGY) , MD Apr 12, 2021 Imaging ECHOCARDIOGRAM 2D COMPLETE W OR WO CONTRAST PRN , DO Apr 11, 2021 The result is abnormalLab LIPID PANEL , DO Apr 11, 2021 Lab CBC , DO Apr 11, 2021 Lab MAGNESIUM , DO Apr 11, 2021 The result is abnormalLab BASIC METABOLIC PANEL , DO Apr 11, 2021 Lab TROPONIN I , DO Apr 11, 2021 Lab TSH , DO Apr 11, 2021 The result is abnormalLab HEPATIC FUNCTION PANEL , DO Apr 10, 2021 Lab URINALYSIS AUTO ONLY , DO Apr 10, 2021 Lab URINALYSIS REFLEX TO MICROSCOPIC-INPATIENT , DO Apr 10, 2021 The result is abnormal Lab D-DIMER,QUANTITATIVE , MD Apr 10, 2021 Imaging XR CHEST 1 VIEW AP PORTABLE , MD Apr 10, 2021 Lab CBC WITH DIFFERENTIAL , MD Apr 10, 2021 The result is abnormalLab BASIC METABOLIC PANEL , MD Apr 10, 2021 Lab TROPONIN I , MD Apr 10, 2021 Lab MAGNESIUM , MD Apr 10, 2021 The result is abnormalLab BNP PRO , MD Apr 10, 2021 Lab CBC WITH DIFFERENTIAL REFLEX MANUAL DIFF , MD Apr 10, 2021 Other type of result ECG 12-LEAD , MD Apr 10, 2021  Results are that they did not find anything really out of whack to cause the symptoms.My heart beats jumped up to 190 and they put me on beta blockers for now.

                                                48 hours after the second dose he began running a high fever with body aches. His fever lasted almost 3 weeks using Ibuprofen and Tylenol twice a day ever day with his fever rarely breaking. I took him to the ER at Hospital on Monday, May 10th. They diagnosed him with Colitis after reviewing a CT scan of his abdomen. He was discharged back home later that evening where he continued on to oral antibiotics: Flagil and Levaquin for 10 days. He was in bed for over 4 weeks with no appetite and lost approximately 15 pounds. It made his chronic vertigo worse with increased memory loss and loss of dexterity in fingers.

                                                He got his vaccine, he had no symptoms at all.  About 3 weeks later he woke up in the morning, his arm was swollen from the elbow down to his fingers, so swollen that he was not able to make a fist which took a week to 10 days to go back down to normal  He went to the doctor and they sent him for x-rays of the elbow, which showed arthritis and nothing else.  they took his BP on both sides to see if there was a difference, there was a 15 point difference in that.  His doctor decided to do an US to see why there was a difference in that pressure.  The US was a week later showed that he had a blockage underneath his right collarbone, narrowing with no plaque.   He has had surgery on his carotid artery 6 years ago, so they sent a report to his vascular doctor.  Talking with him they blockage is 50% to 99% and he asked his staff that he has had CAT scans prior to that due to the carotid surgery and they felt that they had prior CAT scans that showed no blockage.   The vascular surgeon is going to watch it for now as it shows no plaque in the artery and is not sure if it is due to the vaccine or not.  They told him to call us and file the report.  He is having light headedness daily, which he did not have prior to the vaccine.

On 06May2021, the patient got sick. Patient stated: he got sick on 06May2021 in the middle of the night, at 2:30 AM and he layed on the floor for almost 6 hours vomiting and finally he didn&#39;t have anything left, then the cramp started from dehydration in every muscle of my body, luckily not his heart, and that was with cold sweats, he could not get warm he kept trying he did everything. Also it was so uncontrollable that he could not walk either, the muscles cramps, he finally did - he fought that at 66 years of age, which sounds young but he was old, that he couldn&#39;t control number 2 either, because it was fully out of control and peeing, everything was just going out of his body, he could not stop it, there was no blood. He didn&#39;t know where he was. He finally fell asleep. He got up after that, got my cane and got into the kitchen I got a Water with nutrients and vitamins, that night he went to bed, everything was back to normal he was still having cold sweats and then eventually that went away, and he was not feeling well until the first week of May, not feeling himself. He received second dose late because he live by himself, he getting dizzy he need to go back and sit down, this is weird, he already disabled, he been disabled like this he forgetting things like this too, his daughter was a Nurse and told him he forgetting things, his mouth was getting dry ,one more question that&#39;s all how long? he have nausea a lot, he is on on medication for nausea - it crosses blood-brain barrier and he don&#39;t like it, but That&#39;s not even working anymore. How long does this nausea effect, what he felt wasn&#39;t all the time but now it&#39;s all the time, it&#39;s not a heavy nausea it&#39;s not like he going to throw up, it just feels like he have it all the time. He have systemic sporosis, he have raynaud&#39;s (disease), he have gastroparesis and an implant (stomach). He was been sick a long time, he used to being sick, nothing he can do about the headache and nausea, but he want to do this to help everybody with disability and children, his disabilities make it all worse. He was having symptoms and wants to know if they are normal. He does not see if on the paperwork. He feels bad. He was disabled and has gastroparesis, which was prior to getting the vaccines. He has nausea and everything else from the gastroparesis, but the cold, sweaty, and cold feeling occurred since the first shot. First shot was on 03Apr2021. He could not get another shot because he was too sick with his illnesses that he has. He has a Pacemaker for his stomach. All were prior to getting vaccine. He stated he was in the hospital twice for his dizziness but later clarified that he was only kept overnight once. They originally thought he had benign postural vertigo. They did the emily movements in physical therapy to move the crystals in your ears. It seemed to work ok, but today, it feels the same. He walks around and won&#39;t go too far. He is hoarse, but does not have a temperature and is not sore. No further details provided. He goes from being soaking wet to soaking and freezing. He said he is in a good mood, just does not feel good. He lost 15 pounds in 3 weeks or less since he has had the vaccine. He was not trying to. He was laying on the floor and a bunch of other things.

He was soaking wet with sweat, shaking and could hardly walk if at all and then not at all. He was on all fours. He grabbed nearest blanket and sat on top of that with a trash can on all fours. He had a heating blanket and threw it over the top to warm up and was shaking. He could not control anything. He was too shaky. Finally, he layed down on the floor, covered up and stayed warm. He kept wiping sweat off. People that have gastroparesis are immunosuppressed and he was scared of what would happen when he got the shot. He got first shot on 03Apr2021. 0n 04Apr2021, he fell off a ladder. On 05Apr2021, he started getting dizzy during the day. He was nauseated most of the time and still is up until now.

No further details provided on Meclizine. Dizziness came back at the time of report and was persisting with walking. He can walk ok, but still feels woozy. His legs feel weak today and were not previous day. His arms also feel weak. He used wheelchair for first two days after receiving the first dose. Then it improved. His arms stayed the same.

The cramps went away later that day. He was feeling good by the end of 06Apr2021. During that time, he thought he was going to have a heart attack because all of his muscles were cramping. He gets dehydrated quite often. This was prior to taking the vaccine because of his gastroparesis. He said he got C-Diff because the antibiotics they gave him for helicobacter pylori killed everything off. He only remembers the name of one of the antibiotics that did that, flagyl. He does not remember the names of the other one. He does not have the dose, manufacturer, lot or expiration. He tried two and the third one worked. That one that worked was divicid.

I went to see my doctor on 4/22/2021 and my A1C was around 7-8 which is high.  My blood pressure was also elevated.   I am still having symptoms of lethargy, high blood pressure and  high sugar levels after the vaccine. I also went to see my podiatrist for a routine visit on 5/20/2021 and a foot fungus was found. I was prescribed a Terbinafine to treat the fungal infection.

I went in to see my family practice doctor, got tested for COVID 19. It came back negative. These symptoms lasted for a month. I thought I was going to die. I still have fatigue, wheezing and a cough. I have been shaky and have fallen several times. I have lost 40 pounds since I received this vaccine. My family practice sent me to a GI doctor. I have also been referred to an oncologist and cardiologist to do CT scan and figure out why I still experience fatigue. Cardiologist appt on 07/13/2021.

The soreness and weakness got worse after the second dose - I cannot lift my arm over shoulder height without assistance and every time I move it there is some pain - similar to a deep bone bruise.  After the first dose, the symptoms improved within a day; after the second dose they were worse and have not changed since I got the shot on March 15.

                                                About 4 hours after my 2nd dose, I was driving on my way home and all of a sudden I felt like I was hallucinating. I saw what looked like a bug infestation coming across my vision line. It was a swarm of black spots. I had to stop and re-evaluate my situation on the way home. When I gained control again, I realized it wasn&#39;t a hallucination. It was my actual vision. When I got home I basically crashed for the rest of the day. The next day I contacted my optometrist and I went in for an evaluation. They said it was a cloud of floaters. I asked if there was any chance that it was a side effect of the vaccine. They told me no. They sent me to an ophthalmologist. He told me that it will never go away. I went back to my optometrist and they said it would go away. All that they could come up with is that it is a coincidence. I have also had dizzy spells. They weren&#39;t strong, but it was like a constant dizziness. I still have all of the symptoms going on. The floaters in my eye seem like they are starting to dissipate. I have had some mild nausea. I can take a nap and it seems like it dissipates. This all came on at one time. I have been extremely tired lately. I take 2-3 naps a day and that is just not like me. It&#39;s like the feeling of being hungover, but I haven&#39;t had a drink in months.

                                                Violent shivering/ague, intense muscle/joint aches, like flu or maybe mono but but much worse, feeling freezing cold, couldn&#39;t get warm enough. (Temperatures were in the 80&#39;s)  a feeling of nerve irritation under  the skin that moved from place to place.  unsteadiness on my feet, lack of focus, a basic, total shut down. I curled up in fetal position under a pile of covers for 24 hours. Didn&#39;t fully recovery for 3 days  All simptoms hit me more or less simultaneously within 5 minutes, about 12 hours after 2nd covid shot.  Didn&#39;t seek medical attention, just plowed through it.  I imagined a biological warfare agent would have felt like that. &#34;I thought I was gunna DIE!&#34;

Resolved after 150 minutes.  Interestingly, 8 days after the first dose (lot number EL 3247) had a similar but slightly milder reaction that lasted 24 hours. I do have Meniere?s with intermittent episodes like this for many years, but these two events were profoundly more severe than any in the past.

I received the Pfizer vaccine on Feb. 5, and had muscle aches, chills and a cough. I passed out at home on the 10th, cut my forehead, and had to receive stitches. That is when I tested positive for COVID-19. I continued to by symptomatic and opted for the monoclonal infusion. About 5 hours after I received the infusion, I became completely disoriented. I was unable to stand and did know where I was. My wife summoned an ambulance, and I was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. I received fluids intravenously. I was released from the emergency room about 6 hours later.

The following Sunday on 21Feb2021, he had really low blood sugar (40). He never had it this low (blood sugar never got that low like 40). He had to call emergency and went into emergency. He also had to call reported the week afterwards on 2021, his blood sugar was still low. In the following week, his blood sugar still stayed relatively low, not as low as when he went into emergency but it was still low between 50 and 70 in 2021 (also reported that the blood sugar was low the following week, the whole week, his blood sugar was still low, lower than it normally was). After that week, he started getting out of nowhere he just turn around and head started spinning on Mar2021, he was dizzy on 04Mar2021 and he lost his balance (couldn&#39;t tell because his balance was always off because he had stroke so he couldn&#39;t tell if it&#39;s from prior stroke or the vaccine) like he kept falling down and every time he got up he kept falling down (fell down multiple times) on Mar2021 (also reported that then after the week that&#39;s when he started getting really dizzy and falling down)- that just kept happening. He also had a couple of incidents of vertigo but, he usually fall down and got up and it usually go away but this one he kept falling down. He made it to his bed and he was going to call, but he was just resting. After that (now), he had been having off and on headaches on Mar2021. He wanted to know if anyone else has reported this and how long would this last. He talked to 3 of his doctors and these side effects of the vaccination. After the question they said, they really couldn&#39;t tell, as it can be understood that it could be a mixture of his health conditions and all his medications that he takes, cause these things happened he was just trying to find out if there was any different test, what caused his blood sugar go down. They stopped his medication that had brought back up. The falling down and headaches, they were not sure, so he was calling. Other people had called them up, the doctors really couldn&#39;t tell. They didn&#39;t really know. He didn&#39;t blame them. It was hard to tell, everybody was different, so he was just trying calling to find out. He was still experiencing headache on and off and dizziness. The HCP took him off his diabetic medications. He hadn&#39;t taken anything for the headache. He did take a couple of pills for the dizziness when he fell down because might thought it was of vertigo, so they gave him this medication- already taken 2 of them which was meclizine 25mg and took it twice. He had a CAT SCAN (CSCAN) on 09Mar2021 and MRI on 14Mar2021, both with unknown results. The outcome of the event &#39;sore arm&#39; was recovered in 2021 as it already went away; &#39;low blood sugar (40)&#39;, &#39;dizzy&#39;, &#39;headache off and on&#39;, &#39;lost his balance&#39; was not recovered; of the rest of events was unknown.

Only to discover that it was possible that the injection was not administered properly  could have been a SIRVA situation.  Since that time I&#39;ve been to three different doctors, x-rays, MRI, and a cortisone injection. I have currently limited range of motion and I&#39;m hoping that with physical therapy my rotator cuffs and the area of my shoulder will come back to normal. This so far has cost me in copays and my business of teaching children dance and outdoor activities is now gone.

The rash looked like little blisters on top of bumps on my face, with red rash looking spots on back, legs, and chest. The skin on my face started pealing on my face and it burned and itched. Went to see my Pulmonary Doctor first, than Infectious Disease Doctor than Primary Care. I was treated with steroids, creams and inhalers.  Symptoms would get better than repeat for the first month. Still not feeling like I am ok.  Have two more doctors appts. coming up.

                                                Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness; Almost passed out; Very light headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm (shoulder), on 26Jan2021 at 12:00, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, acid reflux, and multivitamin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, esomeprazole for acid reflux, and ascorbic acid/ biotin/ boron/ calcium/ calcium pantothenate/ chloride/ chromium/ colecalciferol/ copper/ cyanocobalamin/ folic acid/ iodine/ lycopene/ magnesium/ manganese/ molybdenum/ nickel/ nicotinamide/ phosphorus/ phytomenadione/ potassium/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol acetate/ riboflavin/ selenium/ silicon dioxide/ sodium metavanadate/ thiamine mononitrate/ tocopheryl acetate/ xantofyl/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER ADULTS 50&#43;) as multivitamin, all were ongoing; omeprazole for acid reflux; and an unspecified multivitamin.  The patient really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. The patient has been administered both first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. The patient had been having some strange things that he didn&#39;t know if its COVID-19 shot related but they&#39;re symptoms he never had before. About 8 to 11 days after first dose of the vaccine (Feb2021; maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021), the patient had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out or almost fainted. The patient clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8 to 11 days. Also, in Feb2021, the patient had almost a very light headache where he almost fainted. The patient went to the emergency room in Feb2021 and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00 to 18:00 the following day. The patient spent the night in hospital, they sent him the next day. While in hospital (Feb2021), the patient had electrocardiograms (EKGs) of his head (as reported), magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of his head, computed tomography (CTs; CT scan with contrast) of his head, and echocardiograms of his heart (microcardiogram). All of those tests came back normal (okay), nothing abnormal on results. They were relating this to a stroke-like symptom; however, the results were normal, also his blood test results were fine. The patient had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3 to 4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. The patient was not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because the event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit. Because of the first episode, the patient then went to his family doctor and the doctor ordered some other testing done. The patient was scheduled to get a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test (stress test of heart), his results on 10Mar2021 came back normal (not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine). The patient believed that the results of those tests both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. The patient was continuing to have some lightheaded episodes or symptoms just about daily but nothing really; continued to have symptoms which was not normal for him. Sometimes, they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes, the patient had a good day, but he had those lightheaded episodes and he never had it before he got the shot. As therapeutic measures in the hospital, the emergency room gave the patient something for dizziness when he was there, but he was no longer taking it. Currently, the patient was really taking nothing. The patient had also gone to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor where he had a balance test or a videonystagmography (VNG) test done on 17Mar2021. The patient will get results of balance test on Wednesday (24Mar2021). Every year (unspecified), the patient goes and get his yearly test in which they had his blood work done and this and his glucose levels were always good, cholesterol level was always good. All the patient&#39;s other tests come back as normal on an unspecified date. The patient had never had these symptoms before, he hasn&#39;t changed his medications or habits and it&#39;s odd that this happened 9 to 10 days after both doses of the vaccine. The patient would like to know if this has been reported before as a side effect related to the vaccine. The patient was not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. Also, he does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can&#39;t figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines. So the patient doesn&#39;t know if anybody else is reporting this but he had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them around days after each shot and he was continuing to have lightheaded episodes but not severe as those 2 but he had lightheaded (dizzy) episodes daily, since the COVID-19 vaccine. But they didn&#39;t know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the COVID-19 shot. And he never had anything like that, and he was not blaming it on the COVID-10 shot. That was the only thing changed in his lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that&#39;s the only thing changed, his medication has not changed, and diet doesn&#39;t change. Nothing has changed other than the patient got COVID-19 shots. The patient wanted to report it, so the company had a report file and other people reporting it. The patient wanted to know if the company was having any other report or something like this so that he would know if it might be related to the shot. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

On 4/3/2021 afternoon, I suddenly couldn?t see well, felt dizziness.  At 3 AM on 4/4/4021,  called 911 because I couldn?t feel my left side.   I couldn?t see well on my left eyes, couldn?t feel left hand, left leg, left face, and the rest  of my left side are numbed and I am not able to move after I was brought to the hospital.  I am now at  rehab Center.

He could not sit up due to hip muscle weakness. Later on Monday, he developed a fever with a T-max of 101.6 °F.  MRI C/T/L spine demonstrated cauda equine nerve root enhancement, lumbar puncture w/ protein 58 and lymphocytic pleocytosis (atypical for GBS), patient was started on IVIg (had infusion reaction) and switched to PLEX (s/p 3 sessions) with clinical improvement. At time of discharge, was able to walk with a walker.

A 67-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot number was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, at the age of 67-year-old, on 25Feb2021, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Traumatic brain injury at the age of 29 which resulted in a CVA (right sided stroke)because the hospital did not know how to give Mannitol, behavioral problems in 2008, run over by a train in 2008, wears two AFOs (one on the left leg from having a right sided stroke, he also wears one on his left leg from having a stroke with right sided weakness, the right AFO was worn since he was 29, and then the other one he started wearing in 2008 when he was run over by a train and almost had his leg severed and he wears a left AFO), dementia diagnosed 4-5 years ago, head surgeries, depression, affective disorder, anxiety. The patient had multiple hospitalizations, and he has hyper reflexivity like all brain patients have. The patient has no history of blood clots or emboli. Concomitant medications included olanzapine (ZYPREXA) taken for depression and oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) taken for affective disorder and anxiety.  The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number not reported) single dose for covid-19 immunisation, pneumonia and flu vaccine in 2008 for immunization and has no reaction. The patient received his second dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021 and two weeks later he was found down/ was found down unconscious at the nursing home and his oxygen was in the 60&#39;s on 15Mar2021. The nursing home did not know if her brother hit his head because it was unwitnessed. The patient was found down, not responsive, and it was an unwitnessed fall. The patient was treated as a trauma patient and that this occurred around 10 oclock on 15Mar2021. At that time, he was transferred to a local hospital to the emergency room and put on oxygen. They transferred him within 4 hours because they did not know what to do. Caller adds that the hospital thought that he had a subdural hematoma but the hospital does not have a neuro radiologist, so the hospital transferred to the other hospital that somebody with head knowledge can look at his CAT scan. The patient was misdiagnosed with a subdural hematoma because there were changes in his CT scan from his 3 previous brain surgeries. The patient had a traumatic brain injury when he was 29, and experienced changes.  The patient was found to have submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli on 15Mar2021 described as central lobar sub segmental PEs in both lungs, PE was within the distal right main artery, pulmonary artery distal left main, left middle lobe, middle right lobe / upper right lower lobe and middle lobar, segmental and sub segmental pulmonary arteries. The patient also had pulmonary emboli in the distal left main pulmonary artery of left middle lobe and left lower lobe, pulmonary arteries. There was also some degree of right heart dysfunction which was diagnosed by contrast. On 15Mar2021, the patient also had right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein. The patient is in a nursing home, the doctor did not want to listen to the reporter because her brother is a nursing home patient and they just assume he is immobile but he is not.  The patient underwent lab test and procedures which included Blood sugar very high (they think it was because of heart strain and acute injury because then it came down down down), A1C elevated, Haptoglobin elevated, elevated troponin. These results were all elevated and from acute injury. At the time of the report, the patient is feeling better and needs less oxygen. The events found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism, right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein, and some degree of right heart dysfunction caused hospitalization from 15Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The reporter absolutely does believe the events and the suspect drug are correlated. Outcome of found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism was recovered on 18Mar2021 while it was unknown for the other events.

It did not get better with rest and time so went to the ER and  an ultrasound and found a clot from the groin to the ankle.  He had no injury to preclude this clot.  He was put on an anticoagulant (Xarelto) and standing and walking is very painful.  He has a follow up appointment set with his PCP 5/6/21  He was told he might have to be on this medication for months maybe longer.

About 8-11 days after first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine he had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out. About 8-11 days after second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine he had a very lightheaded episode that was much more vertigo-like where things were spinning. He clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8-11 days.  Consumer is not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. He does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can&#39;t figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines.   Patient: Age at onset: Over the age of 65 years. Reporter: Address: Unknown. Primary: Further address details/Email: Unknown. Very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out: Onset about 8-11 days after first dose was administered, maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021. He went to the emergency room on the date of event onset and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00-18:00 the following day. While in hospital he had EKGs of his head-verified this information with caller repeatedly; MRIs of his head; CTs of his head; and echocardiograms of his heart. All of those tests came back ok, nothing abnormal on results. They recommended he have a stress test done which was not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Very lightheaded episode that was much more vertigo-like where things were spinning: Onset was about 8-11 days after second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. He has never had vertigo in his life before event. He went back to the emergency room on date of onset of this event, but was not admitted to the hospital at that time; was only in the emergency room about 5-6 hours. While in the emergency room he had CT scans of his head, MRIs of his head and EKGs and everything looks good, nothing abnormal on results. Outcome: He still has ongoing very lightheaded episodes for a good part of the day. Those episodes usually last about 30 minutes and occur multiple times daily but are not really severe like the 2 initial events were following the first dose and then the second dose. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: First dose: 26Jan2021 Lot: EL9263 NDC/Expiry: Unknown, this is not on CDC vaccine record card. Dose: Unknown strength/volume/dose injection to left arm shoulder before 12:00 Second dose: 15Feb2021 Lot: EL9267 NDC/Expiry: Unknown, this is not on CDC vaccine record card. Dose: Unknown strength/volume/dose injection to left arm shoulder before 12:00 - verified with reporter that details were same for both first and second doses. This completed his prescribed therapy. Regarding concomitant products and other medical conditions caller reported he really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. Regarding other testing/investigations done relative to these events:  He had a nuclear stress test and exercise stress test, both performed on 10Mar2021 he believes and results of those tests were they both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. He has gone to the ENT-ear, nose and throat doctor where he had a balance test done which he referred to also as a VNG test-Videonystagmography done on 17Mar2021. He will get results of balance test on Wednesday, 24Mar2021.  He had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3-4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. He is not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit.

Yes NDC number: Unknown UPC number: Unknown Lot Number: EL9267 Expiry date: Unknown History Concomitant Products Other Products Yes Omeprazole Indication - Acid reflux Multivitamin Amlodipine Dosage 5 MG Indication Blood pressure   Additional Context: Consumer stated, &#34;I have been having some symptoms but I did call into one of your number yesterday and they told me call back and try to get into you but they did gave me some case number in case help you, they did an open internet case# and I will give you that number if you like it. It&#39;s # (Hence follow-up was checked). Well I have been having some strange things that I don&#39;t know if its Covid shot related but it&#39;s symptom like I never had before. After I had received the first shot, I had almost a very light headache where I almost fainted. We went to ER, they were sort of testing, it might be stroke like symptom and they did a MRI of my brain and they did CT scan of my brain and CT scan contrast. They did micro cardiogram, some EKGs and work. All of those come back normal. So I spent the night in hospital, they sent me the next day. I continued to have some light headed symptoms but nothing real bad but continued to have symptoms which was not normal for me. After I had my shot about 10 days after the second shot, I had another episode. This was much more vertigo like or the room is spinning and the walk and things are moving. I did go back to ER again just in case there was something going on. They tested again another CT scan and EKG and everything looked normal and they said it sounded like a vertigo related. I told him I had shot about 10 days after each shot, the symptoms hit me. Because of the first episode my family doctor ordered some other testing done, and they did stress test of my heart, a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test of my heart and both came back normal. But I am continuing to have the light headed, the episodes just about daily. Sometimes they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes I have a good day but I have those light headed episodes and I never had it before I got the shot. I am also going ENT- ear, nose and throat doctor to check on vertigo stuff and they did some testing last week and I am supposed to get the result tomorrow on what they found about vertigo test but I never had vertigo or light headed or anything before the shot. So I don&#39;t know if anybody else is reporting this but I had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them 10ish days after each shot and I am continuing to have light headed episodes but not severe as those 2 but I had light headed dizzy episodes daily, since the Covid vaccine. I want to report it, so you guys have a report file and other people reporting it. I guess I sort of want to know if you guys were having any other report or something like this. So that I know it might be related to the shot. I am still working with my ENT and I tried to figure out if it&#39;s vertigo. If it&#39;s not vertigo then they have really run all sorts of test and if it&#39;s not vertigo we don&#39;t know if Covid shot triggered the vertigo or not. Let me know, we don&#39;t know. So they have ran 30,000 dollar test on me and so far all my tests are coming back normal.&#34; Consumer was informed about the role of Pfizer Drug Safety and Pfizer Medical Information.

I received my first shot on January 27 of this year and I had the first episode February 10th, then I received my second shot on February 25th of this year and I believe it was march 4th, I think when I had those episodes. Those are the 2 episodes. I had smaller episodes daily but they were two bad episodes.&#34; When probed for Physician&#39;s details, Consumer stated, &#34;It was distributed from a count location.&#34; When probed for LOT#, Consumer stated, &#34;Hang up one second.

They gave me something for dizziness when I was there but I am no longer taking it. So I am really taking nothing. This time I am working with ENT i.e. ear, nose and throat doctor, they are doing vertigo type testing but they got nothing, the results are supposed to be back tomorrow. I don&#39;t know what test they are going to show, if they do show vertigo there will be some treatments to help me. But we don&#39;t know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the Covid shot. And I never had anything like that and I am not blaming it on the Covid shot. That was the only thing changed in my lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that&#39;s the only thing changed, my medication has not changed, diet doesn&#39;t changed. Nothing is changed other than I got Covid.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Can you give me report#.&#34; Reportum# was provided as # #Is there a product complaint to report?No Is there a medical information request?Yes Please describe the medical information request Consumer stated, &#34;I have been having some symptoms but I did call into one of your number yesterday and they told me call back and try to get into you but they did gave me some case number in case help you, they did an open internet case# and I will give you that number if you like it.

                                                soreness at injection site; Light headed/dizzy; Felt very anxious and tense; Tense; Heart racing; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (reporting on himself). A 67-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EK9231; Expiration Date was not reported), via intramuscular route of administration in Arm Right on 23Jan2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostatomegaly, drug hypersensitivity both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included finasteride (FINAS-TERIDE); ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 23Jan2021 12:30, he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient states he felt fine at the clinic after 15 mins and then after he left he felt lightheaded and dizzy and this continued on. Patient says his reaction was about 20 plus minutes after his injection, which he was fine when he got the injection, he became lightheaded and that has kind of continued on. He says it was pretty bad on the first day, then the second day it went away. He says a couple days later it came back, with his heart kind of racing, and he was still experiencing that though it was getting better. This was not something he had be-fore and he feels anxious and body is tight with dizziness. He says he experiences it periodically, and today it was not bad, but yesterday it came back again. He says he was concerned about that, but he hasn&#39;t passed out or anything. He says he went to the doctor and had an EKG and blood work done, which were all ok. He says it has been off and on, and he was kind of very anxious and tense as well, his insides are tight and jittery, sort of. He says he didn&#39;t see that listed as a common side effect. He says he had soreness at injection site, that went away, and he had no fever or any-thing, just the lightheadedness. He says he wants to see about the lightheadedness, if it had been reported by others, since he didn&#39;t notice it as a common reaction, to see what is going on there, since it has been over a week and it hasn&#39;t totally gone away, so he is concerned about having his second dose. Am doing better now. Went to the doctor for tests on 27Jan2021 (Wednesday). Test results were okay. Patient states these are not some of the common side effects he has seen or read about. He would like to know when will his symptoms go away. Patient would like to know if he should receive the second dose that was scheduled in less than two weeks. Patient states he called his doctor had an EKG and blood work done and his tests were negative. The outcome for soreness at injection site was recovered on an unspecified date and for rest events was recovering.

Also, mobility seems impaired and more pain with certain movements of the shoulder / arm.   Looked this up and discovered uncommon condition relating to vaccination shots called SIRVA (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration).  It?s now 8 days after shot and arm is still quite sore with mobility issues.  I will give it a few more days and if no improvement will seek medical help.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8730), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 10:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included knee surgery, dislocated shoulder (he has dislocated that shoulder in the past several times but had no recent issues), carpal tunnel syndrome and, rheumatoid arthritis, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. In Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm opposite where he received the injection. He reported he like had a muscle tear that it has an intense excruciating pain. He took three aspirin and put a heating pad on it that didn&#39;t touch it. He then reported that the pain went to his knee and it &#34;got all blow up&#34; and stated that that knee had to be drained. He then stated that the calf on his other leg &#34;got messed up&#34; and was found to have a blood clot as well as fluid on that knee. He reported that it was as stiff as a board and that he could not walk on either of his knees for a couple of days. He reported that he still has problems with the one knee that &#34;blew up&#34; and had to be drained but stated that the inflammation in the calf where blood clot was has receded and is back to normal. He stated that he had to visit the emergency room twice and see an orthopedic surgeon for these issues and has been prescribed Xarelto to take to treat the blood clot. In the morning his leg was stiff. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated on 16Apr2021, blood clot on right leg on 12Apr2021, and pain in groin on 13Apr2021. The pain in his groin went down, but his calf swelled to twice the size and it felt like a horse because he was favoring it. It felt like a muscle cramp. The orthopedic saw him for his left knee and he was seen in the Emergency Room for his right and they called his primary doctor. He tried to work and paid the price with his left knee. He has been taking Tylenol and icing it. The last two days (unspecified date) he has been babying it, the weather has been not so great, so he is laying low and give it a rest, but knows he is supposed to get up and move around so he has been doing that and elevating it. He would like to know if, based on these symptoms he experienced after the vaccine, he should get the second dose of the vaccine, which he states he is supposed to get on Tuesday. The outcome of the events &#34;Right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated&#34;, and &#34;Pain in groin&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

He felt like a panic attack, and felt uneasy driving.  He got home and sat for a while and noticed that his body was getting sore, and felt like he had the COVID virus and felt fatigued, joint pain that was worsening.  He did not have a fever and then had diarrhea and vomiting that lasted for a week.  He called an center after he talked to his doctor the first time, and they told him that he had to hang in there as 20-25% of their patient&#39;s were from the vaccine and that it would go away in a couple of weeks or so.   He possibly was exposed to COVID from somebody working in his house.   He took Ibuprofen for pain and soreness.  He is still having the fatigue and brain fog and sometimes can&#39;t get his words together.  He works part-time and is not able to do so at this point as a substitute teacher.    The symptoms are getting better, but he is still not back to his normal self.    He has lost a lot of coordination at this time, was an athlete and gets out of breathe walking 50 yards to his mailbox.

[The second vaccine was given on the Monday following my Thursday kidney surgery on March 4, 2021. Since then, have seen health care professionals and had numerous tests performed (e.g., hemoglobin blood test, CMP, EKG 2x, cartoid artery ultrasound). No known or explanable reason or reasons for my dizziness, head throbbing, arm weakness, etc., have been specifically stated, merely speculation on the part of all providers, resulting in experimentation with doses especially of the high blood pressure Rx (Labatol was Rx&#39;d for a time, but discontinued, about 2 weeks ago).  Regardless of the medicines prescribed, the dizziness, head throbbing have continued and the &#34;heaviness&#34; or stiffening in the L arm has increased, perhaps due to my sleep positions as a result of the uncomfortable sleep position tried after my surgery. (A hematoma developed and took a while to resolve, so perhaps, &#34;bad sleep posture&#34; is the casual factor in all of these symptoms???)

Other than a sore arm for a day or so, no other problem with either dose. First dose was on 3/06/21, Lot EN6205.

I saw a neuro doctor and he order an MRI and they saw brain lesions and swelling. They did a brain biopsy 04/04/2021 and they was looking for cancer. The results was inconclusive. The did a second biopsy on 05/20/2021, they sent samples, no cancer was detect in the sample but it shows abnormal tissues. Now just waiting to see another doctor because they don&#39;t know what is causing the lesions.

He had both the doses of the vaccines. He reported that all started two weeks after he got his Covid shot. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test which was fine. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Patient returned today 7/21/21 to alert us that he still was having arm pain from his first dose and that it was tough to raise his arm.

Based on observation, the vaccine was given in the correct location. Patient mentioned taking &#34;pain pills&#34; to assist with the pain but was unable to tell the pharmacist what medications he took. Pharmacist recommended patient to take ibuprofen and use biofreeze for the arm. Pharmacist and patient will follow up with each other in a week and patient will decide if he should go to see a physician.

                                                Patient noted onset of vertigo just prior to her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer on May 13. Patient describes significant vertigo symptoms for 5 weeks after her second COVID-19 vaccine. Since that time symptoms have slowly improved but still persist. Patient notes nausea but denies vomiting. She is taking an old prescription for meclizine with some relief. My research indicates that approximately 11.8% of patients who receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine experience dizziness. Patient is familiar with the Epley&#39;s maneuver but denies any relief in her symptoms by performing this maneuver. Very specific head movements seem to trigger her vertigo such as twisting turning or tilting her head to the left. Patient flies frequently due to her job. Patient states the symptoms are worse in the early morning and seem to improve through the day. She states that she is able to drive without difficulty. She denies any associated tinnitus. Weber and Renee tests were normal here today (7/23/21 Dr. report).

                                                Shot administered Wednesday morning. Sore arm, but not particularly bad. Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

                                                Three days post-vaccine, I began to experience chest pressure and slight pain in my chest--directly under each of my armpits. After 3 hours I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and they suggested I call 911 and go to the Emergency Department to be sure I was not having a heart attack. Multiple EKGs, a chest xray, and blood tests revealed that my heart was in good shape. I have continued  to have very slight pressure in that area, but it is occasional and is almost gone. Even after 5 days since the vaccination, I am experiencing side effects although they have reduced in severity. Fatigue, occasional slight dizziness, occasional shortness of breath, occasional slight pain in various parts of my body.

                                                Onset of pain left chest along T7 dermatome on the 4 th day after receiving second dose. Over the following six days, symptomes frogresses to extreme skin sensitivity and diffuse aching of chest cage and muscles, back, associated with fatigue and stiffness of joints especially after being at rest and trying to move. By the 6th day after onset of symptoms, an erythematous eruption developed along the left T7 dermatome, becoming more pronounced on the 7th day, but not the true vesicular rash we usually see in zoster dermatitis. Discomfort is relieved by taking excedrin and tylenol. I did not try NSAIDs due to gastritis reaction. No fever or chills, sore throat, cough, etc. I started Valtrex today  to be taken tid.

                                                Loss of balance. This happened when I woke up the morning after receiving the vaccine. For the first hour or two, I could only stand up or walk if I held onto the wall, a railing, or furniture. It gradually went away through the day. Late in that day, and to a lesser extent over the next two days, I occasionally experienced a slight sensation of loss of balance, but I never needed to hold onto anything. I never fell, even during the initial onset. However, I definitely would have fallen during the initial hour or two if I hadn&#39;t held onto things. I have never had problems with balance in the past.  I noticed that the loss of balance happened more when I moved quickly (sitting up quickly, turning left or right quickly, rolling over, etc.)

On the 08Jan2021 at about 8PM he had a massive stroke and they had to life flight him to hospital from 08Jan2021 to 19Jan2021. He did have a blockage in his carotid artery but they have been told. She says her husband just had his second vaccine with lot is EL1283 and exp is Apr2021 and all of this could be a coincidence but he told her to call so that was why she was calling. Also he was diagnosed with, it is 4 words and then leukemia and he had an appointment with doctor to get his blood drawn every 2 weeks. The neurosurgeon that did surgery on him on 09Jan2021 at 4 am said that his carotid artery in his neck was plugged and he went in and cleaned it out and put in a stent and he said that his carotid artery was plugged all the way to his temple and he tried to get that out and couldn&#39;t. He had his stroke at 8PM on the 08Jan2021. They had dinner at 5 pm and at 6pm they were sitting on the couch and all of sudden he started slurring his words and he said his mouth felt like someone give him Novocain and then he had his arm around her and all of sudden it felt like he was choking her so she grabbed his hand and his fingers started rolling up, started closing up tight so she started playing with his fingers and then he went out in the kitchen and then he hit the floor and she called # and the paramedics came up there. When they got there he could squeeze both hands and lift both feet by that time it was 7:30, they had just brought in a chair, by time they got done bringing in the chair they realized his left side was becoming paralyzed and so they had to go back and get the stretcher so they were there for about 30 minutes, maybe 15 minutes then they headed up the hill toward the hospital at about 8pm and they came in and gave anti-blood clotting medicine and took him for a scan with dye, they found he still had a blockage on his brain so at 2AM on the 9th they came in with a medical helicopter and flew him to (institution name withheld) in (place name withheld) and they did an MRI on and seen his carotid blockage there so he had emergency surgery at from # that morning of the 09Jan2021 at (institution name withheld) and he was in ICU from Saturday until a week ago at 3 oclock 13Jan2021 he was placed in a regular room and on the 19Jan2021 at 7:30PM he was moved (hospital name) in (place name withheld) for 14 days having 15 hours per day of therapy for a week and then he will go to (place name withheld) (rehab name withheld) and he could be there 2-3 weeks. Wednesday right before they moved him he needed a therapist in the back and one in the front and a 6 inch belt to help him stand up. He started out 08Jan2021 and was put in (institution name withheld) on the 09Jan2021 and then he was discharged to rehab on the 19Jan2021 7:30 pm She has been told it may take up to year for recovery as much as he can.

He was extremely dizzy and not completely coherent. I took him to the hospital where they ran CAT scans and labeled it a TIA.

                                                Within an hour of receiving 2nd dose started experiencing headaches and dizziness. In addition to the headaches and severe dizziness I started having significant bouts with diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite and have not slept well.  Within a couple days I noticed pronounced tremors in my right hand and I started losing weight from 180 pounds to 157, around 23 pound loss.  I contacted my physician and was alerted to make this report and have an appointment on March 1.

                                                After about 3 hours (around noon) I began to feel like I was coming down with a cold and fever. By 4PM I had chills and body aches. By 8 pm I took my temperature and it was a low grade 99.8. Through the remainder of the night the chills worsened to the point where I was shaking uncontrollably and I could not get warm. I was also very dizzy. The next day (2/26/21) was more of the same along with a very painful headache and muscle aches especially in my shoulders and neck. That night all of those symptoms continued along with very sharp stabbing pains in my left leg above the knee cap. The dizziness also continued and I nearly passed out trying to get out of bed early in the morning. My fever had increased to 100.5 at the highest. I was also very weak by the end of the day on 2/26/21. On 2/27/21 I was beginning to feel a bit better but still had that low grade fever (now about 99.8) a headache and I remained very weak. The weakness was especially evident in my legs - it was very hard to stand up. It is now 2/28/21 and I am feeling nearly 100% myself again.   From all I had read and understood I was expecting to have a reaction to the 2nd vaccine. I did not consider any of this life threatening nor necessary to call my PCP. Still, I wanted to report these reactions as it is my understanding the adverse reactions to the 2nd vaccination are common in people much younger than me.

The yesterday I woke up with a weird feeling on the left side of my lower lip, it is like numbness, like just it feels weird.  I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow.

                                                Slight headache about 30 minutes after receiving shot at 11 AM, Saturday, 3/6/2021. About 5 hours after shot I started feeling like I was coming down with something, like I had a mild fever and headache was a little more pronounced, but still mild. By 8pm I had fever of 102F, headache was now uncomfortable, so took 2 Tylenol and went to bed. Fever broke about 3-4AM, but still retained a very mild fever of 99F with very mild headache,  muscle aches and joint stiffness/pain for the following day and the day after. By Tuesday 3/9, head was starting to clear and feeling like I had mild fever was gone. Headache was no longer. Each day thereafter, my head seemed to be more cognitive/clearer and looking back, I could tell I was not thinking clearly, with difficulty remembering things. Since I was not working, fogginess had zero impact on my lifestyle. I should note the first shot, received on 2/13/2021, I had no effects at all. Nothing. Since I was not feeling very well during this time, I tended towards comfort foods which elevated my blood sugar, but that returned to normal levels by 3/9/2021.

Continued vertigo, but no nausea, for the rest of that day.  Vertigo symptoms have continued, but eased considerably from severity at onset.

Condition is not severe enough at this point to inhibit any activities, but is still present.

The numbness was still in my entire left arm and entire left leg, yet I was able to raise move and wiggle my limbs, toes, fingers to a degree.

                                                Two days after the second injection, two areas that were low-level pain providers - dental thermal sensitivity (hot and cold) and a slight discomfort in my right, repaired shoulder - rocketed up the pain index.  I could not tolerate even tepid tea, and I was unable to raise my right arm high enough to grasp a car steering wheel.  This lasted, getting worse Sunday, through Monday, and into Tuesday morning.  That afternoon i noticed the discomfort in both areas lessening, and by Wednesday evening, had resumed their baseline sensitivities.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was administered on March 11th 2021 at Walgreens Pharmacy, Pfizer Lot number EN6199. The side effects from this dose were mild nausea, shakes, chills, dizzy, somewhat disoriented and &#34;foggy&#34; brain. These disappeared the next day. My second dose was on April 1st. at the same facility. This time I had no reaction. On the morning on April 11th I woke up feeling miserable. The symptoms were identical to the side effects of the first dose, except worse. This time I also had a low grade fever. These symptoms dissipated in 36 hours. On April 13th I woke up to the same symptoms again, though milder, lasting about 8 hours. Today, April 21st,, I woke up with the symptoms one more time, lasting about 5 hours. As I am writing this I feel fine again. As a lay person I have no idea if these are all related. The whole scenario  seems rather odd to me. For your information, I had my yearly physical in late March 2021, all tests were normal.

Patient suffers from confusion, memory loss, difficulty understanding/comprehension, balance.  MRI showed abnormal areas of cortical diffusion restriction involving portions of the parietal lobes, left occipital lobe, and left medial temporal lobe with subtle FLAIR hyperintesnsity.  Since this has suddenly occurred, there has been no prior evaluation or workup for dementia or memory loss.  Possible considerations: CJD, encephalitis, vasculitis, other.  Expectations for Hospital:  Additional testing, diagnosis, treatment.

                                                Following the first shot I had typical flu-like symptoms - fever, aches in joints and muscles, headache and brain fog. The second shot had the same symptoms as the first but after about 22 hours I apparently had some type of anaphylactic reaction - I remember going to the bathroom - but I woke up on the floor by the bed, and could not think how to get back in bed.  My wife called 2 neighbors who helped me up.  It was difficult to form complete sentences.  I was transported by ambulance to ER.  The ER ran a battery of blood tests, CT scan and chest x-ray. The ER doctors and oncologists concluded that I must have had a delayed reaction to the vaccine. Today, April 28, things are back to normal.

                                                He got his vaccine, and had to go from the roof to the parking lot.  He was in his car and thought he had put his car in park, but it was in neutral and he hit another car, which he thought he was hit.  The gentleman informed him that he was the one that hit him as he had watched him slowly advance to hitting him.  He did not know or was aware that he was even moving.  He has headaches normally but they have gotten worse since then.   He also has motion sickness but has learned to deal with it and get used to the side effects.  He also has blurry vision and just not feeling normal.  He did go see his PCP and she put him on Meclizine for the dizziness, which works about 50%, but not completely.     He did have the 2nd vaccine on 2/22/21 and still had the symptoms, which have stayed since then as well.  He then saw his PCP a week ago and she is scheduling for a CT scan to see if he has any blood clots.    He did have an aneurysm in his brain 28 years ago and they felt that he would not be able to survive it and deemed that he would be left as a vegetable, but has survived that and does have a little residual headache, but nothing severe.   He now is still having these three symptoms that he did not have prior to the vaccine.

A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198) on 26Feb2021, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6208) in arm on 19Mar2021 , both at the age of 68 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received flu vaccine in Oct2020 or Nov2020. The patient had his first dose of BNT162B2 on 26Feb2021 and about 4 days later he had stomach pain on 02Mar2021. It lasted about 2 or 3 days then the stomach pain let up. The patient thought the stomach pain was over. Then the patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 and in about the same amount of time after receiving BNT162B2, the stomach pain came back. On Mar2021, the pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t stand up. The patient went to the doctor and he was given 4 ground up Aspirin to take. The patient screamed when the doctor pressed on one spot of his stomach. The patient was taken to the x-ray room and his stomach was x-rayed. He was asked where the pain was and when the doctor pushed on that spot, his back arched up in the air because it hurt. The x-ray showed he had a big black spot in his stomach and the doctor told him it was a blood clot. The doctor on call said it was a blood clot and his regular doctor told him it was a blood clot. The doctor&#39;s determined the blood clot was from BNT162B2 because the blood clot happened right after he received the vaccine. Besides his regular doctor who is listed in the formal field, he also saw another doctor when he went in that day with the stomach pain. He was told his regular doctor was busy and he had to see another doctor. The patient didn&#39;t have any blood drawn at the doctor just the x-ray of his stomach. The doctor said he had a blood clot, a black spot, about the size of a silver dollar in his stomach. The doctor clamped her index finger and thumb together in a circle to show him how big the black spot was. The x-ray technician and two doctors told him it was a blood clot. He had the 4 aspirin ground up and the doctor told him the aspirin got rid of the blood clot. He also took some pills for 2 to 3 days but he can&#39;t recall the name of the pills. He says the x-ray tech zeroed in on the spot that was causing him pain in his stomach. The outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of blood clot cannot be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He was getting a little better- still had a little trouble walking and still feeling a little foggy. He have spinal stenosis and wasn&#39;t sure if that had anything to do with it but said the nurse he spoke to before said she didn&#39;t think it had anything to do with it. He wanted to know if anyone else reported that. He also had concerned about the two week delay in side effects. He stated his 29 year old son took the vaccine the same day and had no reaction what so ever. He did not said if his son had concerned about efficacy because of that or not. Patient enquired if he should go ahead and take the second dose. Patient stated at the moment, he didn&#39;t had a primary care doctor and he hadn&#39;t been to a doctor in over 5 years. He suffered or had debilitating condition, spinal stenosis and he never discussed it by the nurse and it didn&#39;t come up on the questionnaire. He still had a problem walking, he can&#39;t walk a straight line, it was very strange. He improved slightly, it was all terrible on Monday, he was like a drunken sailor, that&#39;s how bad the walking and gait pattern were and he had gotten a little bit better, but it was still a problem. Patient was curious and have concerned about his second dose as he has heard stories from people that the side effects are worse. His concern was as he got a reaction to the first shot, he going to experience on his second shot. The outcome of the event felt a little weird was unknown and for rest of the events it was resolving.

                                                I got the 2nd shot 10 am at the store location which is a  3 1/2 hr drive from my house.  After the 15min waiting period with no issues. I was able to get in the car and head home. The injections site did not bleed and the nurse didn&#39;t need to use a band aid. My wife and I went to an outdoor restaurant and had dinner I came home and everything was fine. I went to bed and when I  woke up, I was  very lethargic and out of it. Sometime during the day, I noticed my 3 middle fingers on each hand and the middle knuckle on those hands were painful and stiff. On my right hand the middle knuckle was swollen and noticeably large. These symptoms lasted for about a week or two. The pain and swelling in the middle knuckle lasted the longest. I was advised by my doctor I have slight arthritis but it does not prevent any of my daily activities.  I noticed several weeks later around the 1st week in May as I would wake up in the morning, a pain would shoot throughout my entire right leg. I would get up and the pain would be gone for the rest of the day, The pain got progressively worse during the first 2 weeks of May. By the third week of May the pain had gotten so bad I could hardly walk. I made an appointment with my orthopedic surgeon with the idea I may need hip replacement surgery. Then I noticed during that 3rd week the pain completely went away. I called to cancel my appointment with my orthopedic surgeon.  Around the last week of May and the first 3 weeks of June I would wake up in the morning I would have to run to the restroom because I had a lot of gas and some diarrhea. On the 17th of June my wife and I took a trip and as we walked around the town, I noticed there was something going on with my digestion and we rushed back to the hotel. During this period of time I would have to go to the restroom 2-4 times in the morning and maybe 1-2 times in the afternoon, This was mostly caused by gas with a bowel movement happening in small amounts throughout the day.  I&#39;ve noticed that these adverse reactions are impacting areas the body where I have may have been compromised  previously.

                                                I feel dizzy and confuse for few minutes but after I went home I was ok.  However  two weeks  after the first shot   I woke up  at 2:oo in the morning with the noise in my head. I thought I was going to get a struck and I was no able to sleep after that. I have to wait for the weekend to be over. I make an appointment with the doctor and I get referrals to a cardiologist and a ENT.  I got US of my carotid artery both sides with normal results. I had a hearing test and they said I has lost of hearing but in my daily life I have not experience problem with my hearing. The ENT sent me for an MRI of the brain and inner ear but came out normal. Since April 14, 2021 I can not sleep at night because of the ringing in my ear.  I spoke with others with this problem after the vaccine and I check on line and learn about others with similar effects and for that reason I am sending this report.

I contacted my doctor and he put me on prednisone. I was tested for COVID-19 and the results came back that positive. The following week my temp continued rise to over 105 and I realized things were getting out of hand and call the emergency response. i  bled out, had hematoma, I had heart failure, and lost my ability to walk. Was admitted to for 12 days.  I was then transferred to Select Speciality for recovery.

The next day following vaccination the patient had a sore arm similar to what he experienced with the first dose. This sore arm progressively became worse and has not gotten any better since the pain began and it has now been over 3 months since he received the vaccine. Patient has a decreased range of motion and experiences severe pain that lasts approximately 2 minutes anytime he moves his shoulder. He states his quality of life has diminished because daily tasks like putting on a t-shirt are very painful and the chronic pain meds that he already takes regularly do not help. He mentioned the shoulder pain during a virtual pain management visit today and the nurse practitioner suggested that he may have bursitis due to where the vaccine was injected. I recommended the patient follow-up with his PCP for the possibility of being referred to physical therapy.

An acute sharp pain started in the left hip, radiating down the front of my to the left ankle. The best diagnosis at the moment is sciatica due to Left L5 radiculopathy.    Treatment sought at urgent care facilities, then a specialty sports injury and orthopedic clinic. Treatment in each case was a course of prednisone and methocarbomol, and physical therapy.  Three months in, the pain is reduced, but still prevents a number of common activities, like driving.  Physical therapy continues, and more tests are scheduled.

My husband was home with our children and one of the children had a psychotic episode - I had been at the hospital on Tuesday afternoon with my child. My husband was against getting inpatient treatment and he did it (suicide attempt) to get me to try to come home. I came home that night at 10:30. There was no treatment that night. Volunteered to go to detox - Thursday for detox   at local hospital - 10:30 morning - he was there until Sunday. I don&#39;t know what treatment there was because I was not allowed to visit him. Was transferred on Sunday  to a different hospital- and he was there for Wednesday morning - 2 1/2 days - He was talking with a therapist there. As far as I know he had two appts.  He is currently - sees his therapist every two weeks and sees his psychiatrist once a month. They have changed his medication - the Risperidone done to 1/4 milligram twice a day. He is trying to get him to stop sleeping all the time. On the past Friday, Medical Center - for chest  pain and seizures. They gave him fluids by mouth - no IV fluids. It took them about 24 hours to get blood out of them - they had to get him hydrated enough for that. He&#39;s not moving much -  he still sleeps most of the time.

                                                lightheaded while working out; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 69-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3246, expiry date: unknown), intramuscular on 10Jan2021 15:00 at single dose (Arm Left; either deltoid or bicep, he is assuming it was his deltoid it was high enough) for COVID-19 immunization (65 and over). Medical history included ongoing Allergic to penicillin (discovered when he was a child), Food allergy (discovered when he was a child, allergy is mainly shellfish), allergy-induced asthma (diagnosed as a child). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Vaccination Facility Type: patient stated it was like a drive-in clinic in a field. The patient got vaccinated yesterday. He felt lightheaded while working out today on 11Jan2021 (about 9-9:30 a.m, unspecified). It was also reported that the lightheadedness only lasted 30-40 minutes. He verified he has recovered completely from it. The lightheadedness happened specifically when he started using weights. He clarified further it was when he was using the cable machine, working with weights/resistance. He wasn&#39;t when he was doing cardio or stretching or working on his core. It was when he was using his cable machine which would include weights and he had to stop. It was stated tht he is looking at the risks and side effects on the fact sheet and it didn&#39;t say anything about lightheadedness, so he thought maybe he should report it. It&#39;s not on the list, but he doesn&#39;t know if its from the vaccine. He also noticed while looking at the fact sheet, where it says signs of a severe reaction, one of the signs is dizziness and weakness. He doesn&#39;t know if what he experienced was the same thing. He thought it was lightheadedness but he may have felt dizziness. He doesn&#39;t know. To him, it was more lightheadedness, but it could have been dizziness. He had to stop working out. He asked what happens now, if they will look into this. He is scheduled to have his second shot on 31Jan2021. He knows a few people who experienced pain and extreme tiredness after getting the second vaccine. He declined to complete a report in regards to these people, stating he just heard 2 other individuals both said after getting the second shot, they were experiencing a lot of pain, didn&#39;t feel good. Felt may be 75% for one day, that&#39;s all he knows. He asked if he should get the second shot or wait to hear from anyone. He doesn&#39;t know if the lightheadedness is a result of getting the shot or something else. Patient states the only thing the card says is the product name and manufacturer. He sees Pfizer and then EL3246. He is not sure if the second digit is the letter &#34;L&#34; or the number 6. This is what is handwritten. He doesn&#39;t see anything else on the literature of the card. No further information was provided or obtained. The outcome of the event was recovered on 11Jan2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Not sure if delayed reaction because it was a week out.  Symptoms included delayed injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, 99.2 temp, injection site red (delayed and only on 7th day), nausea, feeling unwell, dizziness, weakness, and hives which were relieved with Benedryl.    Most of the symptoms began on Monday, February 8th and worsened on Tuesday, February 9th with hives.  There was no shortness of breath or respiratory issues.  Injection site was only tender on day of injection but tender and red on the 9th only.  Fatigue, headache,  hives continued on February 10th along with a slight bout of diarrhea.  Called clinic and they requested he go in and be tested for Covid-19 and results should be known in 2 days.  February 11th seemed to be better and as of 10:00 a.m. PST no hives but still itching and slight fatigue.  Again,  didn&#39;t know if it could be a reaction since it is a week out or something else.

Things were better, I could move around and back to normal by 2 pm.

A 69-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood clots (reported as blood thinner). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 2019 and ongoing as blood thinner. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Feb2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization which gave him severe diarrhea, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, a sore arm and it wore him out. After the second dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 which was administered in a public health department, the patient experienced sore arm. He was concerned because around 02:00 on 19Mar2021, he got up to go to the bathroom and noticed his left leg was basically numb and rubbery.  As soon as he tried to stand up, he fell. He thought the second vaccine was the one everyone says will be harder than the first. They even gave him a sheet of paper that scared the hell out of him. Thought he was okay after the second vaccine until around 02:00. At first, he thought his leg had just gone to sleep. It was like having noodles for legs. The patient has been urinating almost non-stop which also started around 02:00, this was what woke him up. He had to crawl on hands and knees after falling to get into the bathroom, he had no strength except a smidgen of strength in the right leg. On 18Mar2021, while eating dinner, he had trouble holding his fork and did not think much about it. He had a cramp feeling in right hand. Today, while eating lunch with a fork, he also had a difficulty. The patient eats with his right hand. The patient has been trying to learn how to walk since early this morning. He has worn out his wife since she was cleaning up after him in the bathroom and helping him walk. He couldn&#39;t walk to the commode very well, couldn&#39;t hold his water, and has been making a mess all day. He was at first afraid he was having a stroke but had no stroke symptoms. The patient reported that his weight was 201, then mentioned that during the night he thought about how much he was urinating and got on the scale out of curiosity and it said he weighs 191. At this time, his leg weakness persists but he was able to stand and hold his own body weight. Issue with holding fork and cramp feeling in right hand was persisting. Urinating was persisting and stated he was going about every 2 hours and goes a lot. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 17Mar2021; unknown for stroke, fall, and weight loss; and not recovered for all other events.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

Saturday it was exacerbated; peed the bed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for 4 patients. This is Report 1 of 4 for reporter&#39;s brother-in-law.  A 69 years old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation on16Apr2021 10:00. Relevant history included Parkinson&#39;s with associated dementia, which comes and goes.  Relevant concomitant drugs included oxybutynin for bladderwhich had been taking for at least over a year, &#39;ropinirole&#39; for parkinsons, and modafinil 100 mg for focusing; to help her brother-in-laws brain focus. The reporter stated the patient (her brother-in-law) only had the vaccine on Friday (16Apr2021).  He could not remember how to stand, would fall down when trying to walk, peed the bed: callers husband got her brother-in-law up and when he would walk, he would fall down.  They got him up and down to go downstairs to breakfast and have coffee.  He was unsteady.  All of this occurred on 17Apr2021 when they went to wake him up in the morning.  The patient also peed the bed.  The patient just does not always make sense.  On Saturday, he did not make sense.  Sunday, he was better and almost everything was back to normal. He was fine on 19Apr2021; he was himself. The reporter stated that the patient (her brother-in-law) has dementia anyways, so sometimes he does not make sense.  Saturday it was exacerbated, he would ask what to do next or where the bathroom is and this is all stuff that he knows. The patient still had his appetite, the reporter and her husband always say that when her brother-in-law can not eat or does not ask for food then the end is near. The reporter stated the drug Modafinal worked wonderful, he was great on Friday, and he was wonderful before he got the shot. Relevant test was none. The outcome of event made no sense and could barely be understood was resolved. The outcome of other events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Fine one day, next day can barely walk. Attempt to exercise beyond easiest levels will result in the 1 or more of above 1-2 days later.   Depression. No problem with lungs, breathing.  Times of elevated heart rate and / or low oxymeter readings (89-90 where 92-94 is expected) I want to think I&#39;m getting better, but then this morning another chills and fatigue episode motivated this report.   Ps as a longtime serious cyclist, I know how to suffer all kinds of setbacks. I know how my body responds to various exercise loads.

                                                Narrative:  Patient seen in ED 1-17-21 with c/c of &#34;bloated with epigastric pain&#34;. Patient with complicated medical history including stage 1B pancreatic cancer (was currently on chemotherapy mFOLFIRINOX), and a leadless permanent pacemaker implantation on 1-11-21 for long episodes of SR with complete heart block following symptoms of syncope (other cardiac history: CAD s/p CABG 2009, PAF, and HTN). Regarding ER visit for epigastric pain, nothing notable was found on workup and patient was to discharge home to rest. There were available doses of COVID-19 Vaccine following a vaccine clinic that same day, and patient was offered and agreed to a dose of vaccine. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes post vaccine with no notable issues. The following day, Monday 1-18-21, patient&#39;s caregiver called facility at 22:30 to report he had a fever of 102.8 degrees and that he had been &#34;feeling kind of bad all day&#34;. Patient was advise to seek urgent medical care and reported back to ED on 1-19-21 at 00:55. Patient wasd admitted for SIRS (tachycardia and febrile) -- patient also reported diffuse myalgia. WBC WNL, CXR unremarkable for infection, UA neg for bacteria, LFTs WNL, blood cultures negative. Procalcitonin elevated at 17.8 -- suggesting inflammatory response. Patient initially reported feeling better on the morning of 1-19-21, but around 13:00 began rapidly declining (confusion, unable to walk) and started experiencing EKG changes (9 beats of SVT). Patient then coded and resuscitation was attempted for approximately 30 minutes. Patient did not survive the code. Coroner has been notified and family is considering autopsy at time of this report.

I experienced nausea for a few minutes after getting out of bed this morning.  I developed the same symptoms (but much milder) 8 days after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on Dec. 23 (the morning of Dec. 31). Those symptoms mostly occurred when I went from supine or prone to any other position (eg, rolling over). They resolved after about 1 week. I did not report those symptoms because I didn&#39;t associate them with the vaccine. That vaccine was Lot # EH9899.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

                                                My right hip starting aching with a dull pain like at the hip joint.  It also felt like a nerve was being pinched causing a discomfort down to my ache and foot.  Felt like my foot was trying to go to sleep and tingling. This feeling woke me up about 1 am in the morning ( 2/26) and unable to get comfortable to go back to sleep.  Cause me to limp , unable to put full weight on the leg. This lasted all night and during the day has improved.  It feels somewhat weak, but I can put weight on the leg with a light limp. My foot feels like it has recovered from going to sleep and now has blood flowing, less tingling.

                                                He had the vaccine, and around 5:00 PM said he had weakness and he fell to the floor.  Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

A 70-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9265) intramuscular, on 01Feb2021 at 08:00 (at the age of 70 years old), for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 01Feb2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced severe hypoglycemic event (POC=38)/hypoglycemia and chest pain. He was found driving the wrong way down the highway with no memory of the event, once stopped by authorities. He was admitted to the hospital with hypoglycemia and chest pain. His home diabetes coverage was an insulin pump and there was denial of decreased PO intake. The insulin pump was stopped once the patient was admitted. His glucose improved and insulin regular SSI was initiated. He was brought for cardiac cath on 02Feb2021 with no new issues seen. The patient was stabilized, was set for follow-up with PCP and endocrinologist and discharged on 04Feb2021. The events resolved on an unspecified date in Feb2021.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                My left arm muscle located on underarm between elbow and injection site, halfway between elbow and injection site higher up became extremely sore to the touch and prevented me from lifting my arm to preform functions.  Today is much better and function has mostly returned. The reason I am reporting is because I just (jan.29 2021) tore my rotator cuff on right  shoiulder and the loss of function is similar. Function is returning on left arm so no worried, the right shoulder will need shoulder replacement surgery.  But that was the effect on this adverse event. Loss of function to left arm about 3 days with improvement after 36 hours. Kind of a delayed response, so not sure its related. But I didn&#39;t injure the left so probably related.

On April 30, 2020 8 days after second shot while taking a walk and walked like a drunken sailer to the right until stopped by a fence.   Conditions passed after a minute and I went to emergency room .  They found I had bigeminy but ruled out stroke with complete brain MRI and heart ultrasound. It is not yet clear whether the balance issue if inner ear or the bigeminy.  Have monitor and will be consulting with cardiologist and ear doctors to gain clarity.

I am a dialysis patient I had dialysis schedule for 10 the next morning but I didn&#39;t feel well enough to go so they gave me a time later on in the day which by that time I felt good. I was able to drive there and I was good so when I got done with dialysis I could not walk I was too weak to do anyting I had to have my daughter come and get me and drive me home. That had to be a reaction between the injection and the diabetes treatment when does dialysis treatment I&#39;m sorry but yeah then I felt bad the whole rest of the day and I didn&#39;t feel good again until the next morning which is now.

Now, i cannot run at all. if i am on my feet for three hours or more my heels are throbbing and the pain is terrible. i have had tendinitis before and i know how to heal it, but everything i try now does not work and the problem is a bad as it was originally. it has now been about ten weeks and there is no relief in sight. i thought side effects, if any, would last only a few days. is there anything that i can do?

                                                Patient is a male who presents for a 1 month history of numbness, tingling and weakness of the fourth and fifth fingers of the left hand. He presents with his wife who concurs with history. He describes the numbness tingling sensation extending up his left hand into the proximal forearm and what would be the ulnar distribution.  He is noted weakness of the fourth and fifth digits such that he cannot fully grasp with that hand compared to his contralateral hand.  Patient describes more numbness and weakness than frank pain although he has noticed it when he is woken up at night.  He has not taken any specific medication for this.  Patient states this started approximately April eighth ninth or 10th several days after getting his first Pfizer vaccination in the left arm.  That was a Pfizer Lot number EN 8737 expiration July 2021 given on April 6 at the urgent care vaccination site.  Patient feels the vaccine was given behind his deltoid on the shoulder rather than mid deltoid muscle.  He did not have any pain numbness or shooting sensations immediately.  Reports the muscle was a little sore that day or the next but really nothing of significance until several days later. He did not report any significant redness or swelling at the site of the vaccination.  He reports not having any photos of the side of the vaccination but he and his wife did take a photo about a week ago of the area of that he feels is still tender in the posterior shoulder region It is not clear to me whether the soreness in the shoulder extended down to the hand and then improve leaving the hand symptoms or whether soreness disappeared at the time the hand arm symptoms came on. He has not had any similar symptoms he denies having any carpal tunnel or hand problems in the past. Past medical history is pertinent for: some chronic back pain in the thoracic or lumbar region that began after traumatic vertebral fractures following a motor vehicle accident in 2012. he is followed by Dr. of pain specialist of, She is maintained on chronic methadone.  He has had recent lower thoracic or lumbar block with plans to have radioablation therapy to those nerve roots in the next several days. Also has well-controlled hypertension on lisinopril 20 mg and takes 81 mg enteric-coated aspirin daily. Here for evaluation as symptoms have not resolved on their own over the last 3 to 4 weeks

The patient went to bed at 10:30 which is pretty typical, the patient got up to go to the bathroom and realized that he was walking really funny. The patient don&#39;t have a long walk to bathroom, it just came upon him that he was just walking very fine like his legs were going higher than normal (feet going too high) and kind of falling back down and this was very weird state. The patient thought on that, &#34;it seem to be a neurological symptom&#34;. The next day, the patient was just exhausted. The patient came down and laid on the couch and the patient literally could not get his muscles to move properly to get off the couch, the patient just couldn&#39;t do it, and patient&#39;s wife had to pick him up. The patient stated he was very capable and so for him to be immobilized like that was strange. The patient kept trying to figure out why, why can&#39;t he get off this couch. So, that night and the patient slept all day basically and that night the patient slept great. Following day, the patient got up and was still tired and the patient did manage to finally take a shower which he was wanting to do, which worked in the right direction for the patient. The patient also had a rash in his entire torso, thighs, sides and back.

Doctor related this is usually due to a calcium crystal that comes loose in the left inner ear.  (This may or may not have been related to a trip &amp; fall I had about 3 days prior to the first instance of the dizziness.)

I went to pick it up and I could not pick it up, I fell onto the bed and I could not get up. My left leg and left arm were paralyzed and I could barely speak. I could tell I could was having a stroke and I called my wife in as best I could and they called 911. They determined yes it was a stroke and they took me to the ambulance. When I was in the ambulance it went away, it only lasted about 15 minutes. I was taken to the hospital and stayed there for three days.

                                                Day after 2d Pfizer shot on 2/18/2021,, I had moderate dizziness, like throbbing sensation in brain causing light headedness.  Not like the room spinning as in vertigo.  Would last for hours and occur when driving or trying to sleep or just sitting down.  Seemed to lessen when active like walking, golfing, or gardening.  Maybe because my mind was distracted by the physical activity.  This went on until around the first week in June when I noticed it was gone, except for very occasional dizziness every few days.  I went to Dr. who referred me for a Brain MRI, blood tests and a CT scan w follow ups with a neurologist and vascular surgeon.  The March 4. 2021 Brain MRI showed 3 small and one medium ?strokes? appearing to be bleeding strokes, possibly caused by episodic high blood pressure.  I had a Brain MRI in 2007, as part of an evaluation for memory loss and brain fog.  There were no signs of stroke or bleeding in the brain in the 2007 Brain  MRI.  There may be a connection between the Pfizer vaccine and the small bleeding brain strokes shown by the Brain MRI taken a few weeks after my 2d Pfizer vaccine shot.

I developed heart failure symptoms and no longer was able to Jog or rode bike due to DOE, lightheadedness and on hills had chest pain and feeling of near syncope demanding immediate rest.  Increased Toprol Xl 100 mg daily and Flecanide 100 mg bid didn&#39;t help and the latter likely contributed to &#34;Flecanide Flutter&#34; and my new heart failure with EF of 46%.  My heart failure symptoms immediately improved off flecanide and on Digoxin, but my symptoms totally reversed after elective cardioversion and Atrial Ablation therapy 6/10/2021.

                                                Pfizer\BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine On Jan. 27, late in the morning I started to develop a stiff neck which was mild at the beginning, but in the afternoon  became very strong that I could not turn my head. It progressed to hurt considerably by the time to go to bed that I had to support my head with a towel around my neck.  I took a Flurbiprofen 100mg before going to bed and I had the my neck massaged with Aspercream.   I sleep on the sides and moving from one side to the other I had to support my head with my hands. This morning (Jan. 28) the pain went a little down, but looking to the sides was painful. Around noon I took another Flurbiprofen. Tomorrow? Will see.  Now, in the evening, the pain slightly increase again and spreading toward the shoulder blades and  lower on the spine.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 19Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included liver cancer and chemo. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that for two times, the patient woke up in the morning delirious, did not know where he was, hollering for his wife, couldn&#39;t get up, got sick and vomited, after he got up he felt pretty good. States he fell asleep on couch that night, toward morning he rolled onto floor, flopping around on floor like a wet seal, flopping arms around tried to roll over, pulled muscle in rib cage, after he got back up, got sick and had to vomit. Once he got up and went to the bathroom and all of that went away, wanted to know if this is this related to the Covid vaccine. This morning (unspecified date) he laid on the couch and he was about half scared to lay down because he was afraid something would happen again. The patient confirmed that he experienced this twice the day after or a couple days after the vaccine (unknown date). The patient stated that it has not happened again. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                walking is still very bad; lower back pain; he reported lower back pain, that has migrated more to the right hip and into the glute; he reported lower back pain, that has migrated more to the right hip and into the glute; it might be kidney pain; arm pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other Health Professional (HCP). A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3302), intramuscular on 22Jan2021 15:10 at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml by intramuscular injection left shoulder) for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure (diagnosed about 21 years ago), ongoing gout (Diagnosed about 2 years ag), ongoing ankle spur right foot, ongoing diminished cartilage both knees, joint pain. The concomitant medications included torsemide. The patient reported adverse event (AE) after his first Pfizer-Biontech covid19 vaccine at 15:10  on 22Jan2021. He reported arm pain starting 3 hours after vaccination until noon the next day (23Jan2021). When he woke up on 23Jan2021 he reported lower back pain, that has migrated more to the right hip and into the glute. The pain inhibits walking, standing, etc. He did note that he is &gt;300lbs and has had joint pain in the past, but the hip pain is new. He also thought it might be kidney pain, as he takes a daily diuretic. He stated he has been treating with Aleve twice a day, but that walking is still very bad.  The patient is an optometrist that was calling about the Covid-19 vaccine and said that he did not know if the Lot number written on the vaccination card is EL3302, E13302, or EI3302. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and reported that he got a sore arm about 3 hours after receiving the injection. He woke up with a sore lower back pain. He is 5ft 9.5 and 310 lbs and he is on Torsemide, a pretty strong diuretic. He woke up with the back pain and stated that it moved right and middle to his buttocks, a little lower than the end of his spine and to the right. He did not think it was his kidneys. He said that Torsemide can make kidneys work overtime. His knees were pretty shot, the left worse than the right. No further details provided. He was upset to know that he has shrunk a 1.5 inches over the years. He has been taking 2 Aleve a day since Saturday, this morning was his 4th pill. He said that it is really odd when he stands equally on both feet his lower back hurts. He has to sleep on his right side and that it hurts more when he sleeps on his back and on his left side. He was fearful doing eye exams next to his patient and how the lower back pain would affect him.  Reporter considered seriousness for Lower back pain was Medically significant. The outcome of event lower back pain was not recovered; of event arm pain was recovered on 23Jan2021; of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event low back pain cannot be excluded. The ongoing gout and concomitant drug torsemide may also play contributory roles to the event.

He had to be watched overnight in the hospital 2/11-2/12.  By 48 hours after the vaccine, he felt improved and normal by 72 hours.  Note that pt had similar but not as severe reaction the first vaccine(Pfizer EL9882) that I was not aware of til now.  Also note that pt had covid infection about 3 months prior to this vaccine.

These were the same symptoms that I experienced after my first injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine administered on February 2, 2021. I reported that event under VAERS temporary  case number 279639 on 02/02/2021. As with the first event, the symptoms began in 5 minutes and lasted about 8 hours. However, the symptoms associated with event in this report (second injection) were more severe and peaked about 45 minutes after injection, as opposed to about 30 minutes after the first injection. I reported the first adverse event to the nurse before she gave me the second injection and she had me placed under observation for an extended period of time. The trouble mentally focusing, unsteadiness, and shaking were more pronounced this time and got worse after 45 minutes when I got up and walked to the car, but began to diminish rapidly that. I did not attempt to drive.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male patient with a complex medical history with multiple problems and cancers and debilities.  He received a second dose of COVID vaccine yesterday about midday.  Shortly thereafter, he started having shivers and shakes.  The concern that I had when he called the office was a possible bacteremia.  He was sensitive emergency room for evaluation.  He was noting that he was chilled and was unable to get warm. He said his temperature was up to 100.5.  He had generalized weakness and inability to get up and walk and had malaise.  He has no known exposures to pneumonia or other illnesses.  He has basically been homebound for the past year with the COVID.  He was evaluated in the emergency room and found to have an elevated white blood cell count on the right upper lobe pneumonia on portable chest x-ray.  Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained since he had a urine abnormality as well.  The patient was admitted to observation while we wait on cultures and we treat the pneumonia with antibiotics.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

Rushed him to Urgent Care, they sent him home and the next day I took him to ER. He was admitted. MRIs, CT scan, Blood Cultures, 2 Covid tests.  Nothing definitive as to why he was so ill other then a viral infection.   We are not assuming or indicating it is vaccine related but we think it&#39;s worth noting.  Nothing in his routine had changed other then receiving the 1st vaccine.   No one at the hospital indicated it was related.

Later that same day at an earlier scheduled doctor&#39;s office appointment my symptoms were less pronounced; bp 142/80 per doctor&#39;s exam. The blood pressure spike was sudden, unusual and concerning as there was no explanation for the spike.  On the evening of April 9th, , 4 days after receiving second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine I experienced blood pressure spike (bp 167/98; 163/101) dizziness, chills, very light headed, heart pounding, feeling faint and nausea. The blood pressure spike was sudden, unusual and concerning as there was no explanation for the spike. Before bedtime my BP had dropped to 153/88, heart pounding had ceased, but other symptoms only slightly less pronounced. The following morning BP was back to my general levels 133/85. Light headedness, and nausea persisted but milder.

A 71-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 06Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included liver transplant, Patient&#39;s liver transplant was 6 years ago. A-Fib from an unknown date. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital in (Name). Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter believes that patients sister has A-Fib. There were no concomitant medications. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Patient received a flu vaccine way back in Aug2020. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was Not provided. It was reported that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer of the vaccine was on 24Mar2021, Wednesday, at 4pm. On Thursday, usual fatigue, that people get, Friday morning, diarrhea 1 bout, and dizziness, gave him water, HR erratic 80, 90 to 70 into 100, which as like AFib, BP went to 64/55, put in in w/c had him lay down, hand cold, weak, drain. He drank electrolyte water. started to take BP and HR and Oxygen level, his Blood pressure was 64/55, She called PCP, the nurse got on the phone and asked questions, and monitor what had happened, monitored Heart rate until 20 minutes it became regulated, in the 90s and staying in the 90s. If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue. Early Friday morning, he woke up patient had one bout of diarrhea. Then patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit. Patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 90s at least it was fluctuating within the 90s. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient also had low blood pressure. The patient continued to drink cold water, and the reporter was monitoring him. The patient did not go into A-Fib again the next day. Reporter has called several people. Reporter has called transplant people, and patients primary care physician. Reporter was asking them questions about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they thought it was an allergic reaction. Reporter asked them if it could happen again with the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital. Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress.

Patient started feeling better on Saturday, 27Mar2021. Early Friday morning, patient had one bout of diarrhea: Reporter clarifies that patient experienced diarrhea and got dizziness.

After the A-Fib started, patients heart got more stable after about 20 minutes. Reporter then hung up with the nurse from patients primary care physicians office. Patients heart rate continued to be erratic until supper time, but it was not bad. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours.

                                                He is shrinking a little; patient has gained weight; completely deaf in his left ear/hearing loss; wife thinks the patient is not hearing well out of his right ear; he had walked straight into half of a wall because he was so off kilted; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife) via the Pfizer sponsored program. A 71-years-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EP6955), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 09:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization (Age at vaccination: 71 years). Medical history included transidential Global Amnesiatic Episode from Mar2021, blocked carotid artery on his left side and tinnitus (had a history of Tinnitus in his left ear for about 4 years but he could hear). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BAYER ASPIRIN) for carotid artery blockage. The reporter stated that the patient was completely deaf in his left ear and had hearing loss on 10Apr2021. The reporter also stated that he had walked straight into half of a wall because he was so off kilted on 27Mar2021 . The wife thinks the patient is not hearing well out of his right ear on 10Apr2021. The reporter also stated that he is shrinking a little and the patient has gained weight on an unspecified date. The reporter also says that she thought that her husband&#39;s side effects started a little late after the vaccine date, has that been reported? Her husband had made the mistake of getting on the internet even though she said not to do that. She jokingly says that her husband is like a medical manual and he thinks that he is going to die from everything. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included height: shrinking and weight: gained on an unspecified date and CAT scan and MRI: Transidential Global Amnesiatic Episode on Mar2021. Outcome of the event deafness and hearing decreased was not recovered while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP7533), intramuscular administered in the right arm, on 06Apr2021 12:00, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a clinic. Medical history included dementia (frontotemporal dementia, behavior variant) from Jun2010 and ongoing, could not speak, hypothyroidism, prostate and urinary problems, and COVID-19 in Dec2020. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism from 2020 and ongoing; and morniflumate (FLOMAX tablet 4 mg) taken for prostate and urinary problems from an unspecified date (reported as 5 or more years) and ongoing. The patient did not have prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 06Apr2021 at 17:00, 5 hours after the vaccination, the patient experienced fever (103.2 degrees), lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair, needed help getting him in and out of bed, conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space, chills, and was so cold that his fingertips were blue. On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. The reporter further explained that the patient experienced chills, fever, lost the lability to walk and needed a wheelchair, and needed help getting help in and out of bed. She stated he was unresponsive but clarified that he was conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space. The chills lasted for less than an hour. She put a heating blanket on him. She added that he was so cold that his fingertips were blue. The chills ended and he ran into a fever which lasted for 10 hours. She mentioned that if his fever would have been greater than 105 degrees, she would have sent him to the emergency room. The highest it reached was 103.2 degrees. She gave him Tylenol and cold compresses which brought his temperature down to 101. He was comfortable. Initially, on an unspecified date, his breathing, color and blood pressure were all good. While he had a fever, she observed that to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. From a cardiovascular view he is healthy. The local paramedics come and check on him periodically and the reporter monitors his glucose and blood pressure (unknown results). She stated that all of these were complicated by him having dementia. The reporter stated that he was getting better. She was not panicked and was not complaining. She wanted the officials to know that she thinks people who have had Covid should be tested to see the level of antibodies present or a titer test before having the vaccine and that maybe they not need the vaccine. The events did not require visits to emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The reporter assessed the events &#34;Fever (103.2 degrees)&#34;, &#34;lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair&#34;, &#34;needed help getting him in and out of bed&#34;, &#34;conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space&#34;, &#34;fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths&#34; as serious (medically significant).

                                                Extreme dizziness when waking up Thursday morning, and very tired. Could barely walk a straight line without holding on to something. Like I was drunk but not nauseous. 2nd day just as bad. 3rd day a bit better. Finally 4th day no dizziness but still a bit tired. My wife felt the same way, but 4th day still a little bit dizzy.  Good friend near us woke up with the same dizziness. She too had the Pfizer shots.

COVID-19 Unknown, Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia Yes, Palliative care encounter Not Applicable, Declining functional status No. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY; Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission, Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19,Respiratory failure. Sigmoid perforation with abscess. Hospital Course; 71-year-old male prolonged admission for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. No history of colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung mets. Prior resection of bowel, prior chemotherapy. Required management in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure over the time that he has been admitted to Hospital (20 days). He had remained on BiPAP therapy throughout that time, received appropriate corticosteroids, and antiviral therapies. Approximately 1-1/2 weeks ago he began to develop mild left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In the last 48 hours this is significantly worsened. CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained on Friday, which displayed pneumoperitoneum, sigmoid abscess with sigmoid perforation. There is a prior anastomotic site distal to this. Given his overall complexity he was to be medically managed to avoid the need for OR and intubation.  He did well through the initial 24 hours of IV antibiotics, fluids and bowel rest. This afternoon he became increasingly dyspneic, required implementing nonrebreather mask, and subsequently developed severe rigors, tachycardia.  I obtained a stat follow-up CT scan which shows similar findings of free air within the abdomen. Given signs of impending sepsis, BiPAP therapy was initiated, bolus IV fluids were given. Blood gas, blood counts, lactic acid are pending.  He is receiving empiric Zosyn.  I discussed this with general surgery, whom is well-known to the patient. In agreement the patient likely needs surgical intervention. However given his overall complexity and in light of the fact that this area surrounds the ureter, and we do not have urology coverage. It was felt he was most appropriate to be managed in Hospital. Case was discussed with Dr. at Hospital, patient will be transferred there via air transit. At this time his blood pressure appears stable, he is tachycardia, is currently on BiPAP which will be transitioned to CPAP for transport. He has received several doses of Dilaudid, for improved pain control. No further advancement of airway was performed prior to discharge. Case was discussed with family at length, all risks and benefits of transfer were discussed with wife and patient. It is recommended to involve pulmonary critical care services including surgical ICU care as if requiring surgery he is high likelihood for prolonged vent needs.

Active Problems: Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon. Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present COVID-19. Perforated viscus. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Respiratory failure, acute, Hospital Course; Patient is a 71 yr.. male with history of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, prior bowel resection and chemotherapy. The patient initially tested positive for Covid in early March. His symptoms at that time are mild and resolved. He was later vaccinated and that month. He started having severe symptoms again on 4/3 for which he presented to Hospital. Since that time, he has received full course of Remdesivir and steroids. He had a CT scan performed on 4/23 which revealed pneumoperitoneum secondary to presumed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with focal sigmoid abscess. Patient was weaned down to minimal nasal cannula settings but somewhat suddenly earlier on 4/25 patient had increased work of breathing, became tachycardia, and had rigors. Hospital ordered repeat CT scan which showed similar findings in the abdomen. Patient had been maintained on Zosyn. Repeat labs were sent which were largely unremarkable. Given concerns for worsening sepsis and potential need for surgery, he was subsequently transferred Hospital. On admission to hospital, he had a normal lactic acid and no leukocytosis. He did not have evidence of peritonitis. The decision was made to treat his diverticulitis conservatively. However, early on 4/26 the patient started to develop a lactic acidosis. An extensive discussion was had with the patient and his wife regarding surgery and the possibility the patient may never be able to separate from the vent given his worsening Covid pneumonia. The patient elected to undergo an exploratory laparotomy with with segmental resection of distal descending and loop transverse colostomy. However, as the days progressed the patient had worsening respiratory status that required deep sedation, paralytics and proning all of which were unsuccessful in maintaining his oxygen saturation greater than 88%. His wife, knowing that he would not want to have a prolonged course on the ventilator, elected for transition to palliative extubating with comfort care on 4/30 and the patient expired roughly 10 minutes after extubation.

                                                A few days after the second Covid shot I started having chest pains, shortness of breath, dizziness after just  just walking or mild exercise . This persisted  fir a couple days until I went to a heart doctor  had PET test , went to heart hospital for angiogram and had a stint placed into LAD heart artery on March 29.  I am still having chest pains and shortness of breath. But not as severe as before the stint was put in artery.   Before I had the second Covid shot I could exercise hard with no ill effects.  After Covid shot I could barley  walk 50 yards without severe chest pains etc.

This patient reported similar events for 5 patients. This is the 1st of 5 reports.  A 71-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 18Feb2021 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; age at time of vaccination: 71 years. Medical history included open heart surgery (8 to 10 years ago since they found a blockage and fixed it, there was no damage, it was a double bypass), blood cholesterol abnormal, blood pressure abnormal. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin taken for cholesterol from an unspecified start date and ongoing; amlodipine taken for blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; and ongoing unspecified multivitamin. The patient previously received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) as a single dose on 27Jan2021 10:00 (lot: EK4176) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported severe fatigue, achy shoulder, neck not sleeping well and body pain. The patient went to hospital in April and was referred to Chiropractor, he has been going for two weeks. He cant even lift his arms up due to the pain. This patient also reports that four other people he has talked to are telling him they are having the same side effects. Events very fatigued, tired, had no energy started Apr2021 with outcome of recovering. Events sleeping from 12 to 16 hours a day, very lethargic, lost four to five pounds in the last couple of months, started Apr2021 with outcome of unknown. Events muscles and joints started to ache like crazy, pain in his shoulders, pain in muscles from his groin to his thigh, pain in his hands when he wakes up in the morning, pain in his neck, bottom of his feet will start to grab and cramp up and hurt, pain in the ankles, pain in his back started Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered and reported as worsened. Event doesnt get good sleep at night started Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered. Events neck not sleeping well, body pain, he can&#39;t even lift his arms up due to the pain started Apr2021 with outcome of unknown. The patient underwent shoulder and neck x-ray in May2021 result arthritis. It was also reported as January and early February, he was out walking 4 to 6 miles a day, not having any real problems. He had the Pfizer vaccine both shots and he did not have any problem at the time of the shot, his arm didnt get sore, he didnt have any problems at all. Fast forward a couple of months, he was very fatigued, tired, had no energy, sleeping from 12 to 16 hours a day and very lethargic and then his muscles and joints started to ache like crazy, pain in his shoulders, and now if he walks a mile thats a long walk for him, hes very tired. He has lost 4 to 5 pounds in the last couple of months, he just wonders if this Pfizer vaccine is causing his antibodies to kick against itself. He went to the emergency room about 2 to 3 weeks ago, they did x-rays of the neck and shoulders because it was bad. He had some arthritis and sent him to physical therapy because he cant lift his arms up above his chest. His muscles are starting to hurt and as long as he is up and moving, he is not as bad. When he lays down at 10:00 PM at night to go to sleep, he is up at 12:00 in pain. He got his shots in February, and in April it started, so it was like a couple of months after the shot because he went online and they said side effects usually last one to two weeks right after it, but he didn&#39;t have anything right after, but then 2 months after, he started getting really tired and aching and then the pain came. The pain in his shoulders, muscles from his groin to his thigh, it&#39;s in his hands when he wakes up in the morning. Once he starts moving things, it&#39;s okay. The pain also began in the first two weeks of April. He&#39;s tired still and aching but could be due to the fact that he doesn&#39;t get good sleep at night, if he was sleeping all night then maybe he wouldn&#39;t be as tired. Fatigue, tiredness has gotten better, its improved. But the pain is getting worse; sometimes he will be lying in bed at night and the bottom of his feet will start to grab and cramp up and hurt. The events required a visit to Emergency Room; he doesnt really remember when he went, he knows its been over two weeks ago. The first part of MAY 2021, they did an x-ray on the shoulder and neck, that&#39;s where the greatest pain was, and all they saw was arthritis. They scheduled physical therapy and he started physical therapy and did that for two weeks but that has not done anything. He has continued with physical therapy while doctors start doing other checks. The patient called physician today and he is having blood work done this week and they are having a CT scan done next week. Outcome of the events arthritis and when he lays down at 10:00 PM at night to go to sleep, he is up at 12:00 in pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021542938 Same reporter/drug/event, different patients;US-PFIZER INC-2021542943 Same reporter/drug/event, different patients;US-PFIZER INC-2021542944 Same reporter/drug/event, different patients;US-PFIZER INC-2021542945 Same reporter/drug/event, different patients

                                                At time of injection I felt pain in arm which  I normally do not feel.  Shortly thereafter my upper arm and shoulder started hurting. The arm was difficult to raise and painful to move.  Eventually the severe pain subsided over a weeks time. The ache in the upper arm and shoulder persisted. As of today the arm becomes weak when raised above 90 degrees to lift anything.  A constant ache of upper arm and shoulder is continuous when at rest. I golf a lot and my arm hurts 2/3 of the way into my backswing and often impedes my ability to complete a swing. I have not sought treatment but did report to my general practitioner  about 2 weeks after my injection. He advised Tylenol which i did not take.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter). This consumer reported similar events for three patients. This is the first of three reports. A 71-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 01Mar2021 (at 71-year-old) as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included that he had the cholesterol of a twenty year old, the month prior to getting the second vaccine, he had a yearly work up of his heart and cholesterol and all that, they put a heart monitor on him to be sure everything was fine with that, and he had gotten a clean bill of health. He had never had any sort of medical situation or even surgeries until two years ago (2019), when he had a knee replacement, and he had a history of shingles, he got about fifteen years ago (2006) and they never really went away, so he&#39;s had on and off for the past fifteen years. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 10Feb2021 (at 71-year-old) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had two strokes on 19Mar2021 (reported as eighteen days after his second vaccine) and has been in the hospital ever since. He has developed anemia, he had muscle atrophy, and he was experiencing persistent fevers. He said that its like his blood was fighting/contradicting himself and they were pretty sure that it was from the vaccine. He already had 1 blood transfusions and his white blood cells were low and his ANC (absolute neutrophil count) was normal. Caller said nothing medically makes sense. She said it&#39;s like the vaccine changed the protein in the blood. The patient has had test after test after test, has had strokes in the medulla cerebellum, his hemoglobin won&#39;t stay above seven, he&#39;s had multiple blood transfusions, with signs of inflammation and infectious disease, but nothing in his body told them. No scans, blood tests, surgery, biopsies, ultrasound, he&#39;s literally had every test. Caller added patient was dying, and they didn&#39;t know why. He remained hospital from 23Mar2021 until he went home on 15Apr2021. While in rehab, patient started developing fever of unknown origin, that they can&#39;t figure out. On 25Apr2021, the patient went to the emergency room. He was home ten days and was declining that whole time, with fever up and down, lost cognition, really confused, which they thought was a result of stroke, but he was declining rapidly. He had fell a bunch, started losing muscle, muscle started atrophying at that point. When they took him in on the 25Apr2021, it&#39;s because his blood pressure dropped, another issue that started all of this, he could not maintain his blood pressure, if he sat up and moved, it would drop. And that day when he tried to stand and it dropped and he slid down. They took him to the emergency room and he had a potassium deficiency and they gave him potassium. He went home that day after the potassium. Then on 27Apr2021, he went back to hospital, into their emergency room, and spent a couple days in the ER, but was admitted into a room once available and stayed until 15May2021, when they transferred him from there. He remained here from 15May2021 to 21May2021. They were wanting to transfer him to another hospital. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

His doctor told him that he will prescribe him something to calm the nerve ending like he was experiencing. After the covid virus he was feeling fine until he received the Pfizer covid vaccine. He stated his doctor told him that he read the vaccine was causing some of these problems in people. Pfizer should let the public knew about these issues. The reporter wanted to know if anyone had died due to loss of memory and chest pain after getting the Pfizer covid vaccine. He had a first one, it wasn&#39;t terrible the second vaccine he had it about two weeks ago now, he was experiencing real shortness of breath and that was 2 weeks ago and also he had a weird sensation where had a shooting pain come across his chest to his breast and he felt like he was out of breath and now he still like really-really out of breath, it took a long time to go away. The patient got the vaccine around it was 2 weeks ago. Today was the, Thursday 13. So, they roughly around the first or second you know, that&#39;s when the patient got the last shot and then he started to feel these pains around the 08Jul2021 and it just start to get worse then around the 10th, that was Saturday. The patient had 5 of them, that day and then Sunday 11Jul2021, he had about 4,5 and he was in the hospital when he was having them, he was in the emergency and then they what they done an MRI of his brain, they thought, he might be having a mini stroke and it wasn&#39;t it and the doctor said it could be the shot that got for breath and he went to his regular doctor today and she said the same thing she was going to heart doctor tomorrow but his regular doctor said she believed, it could be the shot. The patient got the second shot on left arm because he didn&#39;t wanna mess around the right arm again to get swelling back. It&#39;s on his left arm, that&#39;s where the pain started, right underneath right across from his breast okay, underneath his arm, it went, it started really the patient could feel prominent line and it&#39;s stronger and stronger and then it come close to his nipple of breast and then it started to go away and then he got like you know dizzy again and after little bit of dizziness went away and then but he was on weak side again. The patient had tones of blood work. Outcome of events: It&#39;s definitely persisting because he just spent the last weekend in the emergency room and he hadn&#39;t had these problems before. Reporter stated about treatment, &#34;Well. He did, when he was in the hospital, he was hospitalized and they did an MRI of brain, they checked the his blood vessels in his neck and also they did a chest X-ray and they were saying because one Saturday, he lost his memory like for 4 hours he didn&#39;t know where he was, he knew who I was but he didn&#39;t know where he was why he was there, he totally didn&#39;t know what present, it was he didn&#39;t know, what year it was, like he lost everything for about you know about 4 hours I guess and about 5 O&#39;Clock he knew everything, so they couldn&#39;t figure that out that&#39;s why, they did all these test they thought that he had like any mini stroke or something but they did rule that out.&#34; When asked if still in hospital, reporter stated, &#34;No, he&#39;s home he was hospital yesterday. Today&#39;s what actually what was there Saturday and Sunday, and today is Monday he was released on Monday.&#34; Reporter again handed over the phone to the patient. The patient stated, &#34;it was nothing you know and the scary part is like, my wife said you know, I lost my memory and I never had done that before either and the doctor, that ordered the MRI of my brain. He came to my room and he said to me, we can rule out that you didn&#39;t had a mini stroke, he says everything is fine. He says I really think it&#39;s the shot that you got or the one or two has caused it, he said that the Pfizer shot or the, you know, whatever he read where it does affect your nerve ending and he is saying it could have been a nerve ending or something coming from under my armpit over, but today I didn&#39;t have none of them attack but I am, my light headed and my breathing are hard, I mean, I can breathe, my lungs are okay, they took an X-ray my lungs and everything. Everything is Okay with my lungs but you know, my breathing like last night I was going to die in bed. I was breathing so, hard like I was afraid it&#39;s my breath and I came through the night but I felt the same way today and all day I felt, shortness of breath and like light headed but I didn&#39;t get any more attacks. I underneath but still like I feel like cow in other words.&#34; The patient had read, and specialist that read the MRI and both of them, they both think, It could be the shot that the patient got. Treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown. The lot number for the vaccine, [BNT162B2], was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Patient expired. Per Emergency MD note: &#34;This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.&#34;

                                                Patient reported he did not have any significant reactions to the first dose of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine given on 3/3/21. I have counseled patient on possible side effects and patient said he has no question. He looked fine after receiving the vaccine. However, after about 5 minutes, the wife who also received the second dose at the same time said he&#39;s not feeling well. I immediately went to check on patient and asked how he is feeling. Patient said he is feeling dizzy but has no problem in breathing. Wife and I were supporting patient in case he fell. I directed technician to call 911 and call for support from the front. Patient looked pale and hands were shaking. I kept talking to patient to keep his attention because he looked like he was about to faint. I had wife removed his mask in case if he had trouble breathing. Patient said he felt better after sitting for awhile. I checked his BP which was 68/48 and HR was 49. Patient said his normal BP was over 130. EMT arrived and checked his vitals and took him to ER due to low BP and HR. I called to follow up with patient after 6 hours. I spoke with wife who indicated that ER monitored patient and discharged him. Since he got home, he threw up 2-3 times but he was ok when I called and was resting. I counseled wife to ensure he stayed hydrated and if he gets worse, then she needs to take him to the hospital again. Within an hour, wife came to the pharmacy and said she&#39;s taking her husband to the hospital again. Wife has no reaction to second dose. She said she took aspirin just in case but she is fine.

                                                In march I started becoming SOB and it continued to progress.  It became so bad that I could only walk about 5-10 feed before becoming totally exhausted, needing to sit down for a few minutes.  My heart rate remained sinus-tach running up to 120&#39;s.  On March 4, 2021 I had an appointment with Dr.   He sent me to the Hospital to have a CTA.  The test was positive for a MASSIVE bilateral PE.  Doppler studies of my lower extremities showed a partially occluded Palpitate vein in my right leg.  I was admitted to the hospital and started on Heparin IV.  I was also taken to the Cath- lab where I underwent a Thrombectomy of my right lung.  The Cath-lab quit working so the procedure was stoped and the left lung was not treated.  On admission to the hospital my O2 sat was 97%.  After the thrombectomy my O2 sat went to 83%.  I was placed on Hiigh-flow O2 via nasal cannual.  On March 8th I was started on Lovenox SQ for 30 day and discharged from the hospital on March 9th.  I am now on Eliquis 5 mg bid and doing much better.

Patient reported that he took his shoe off and saw a lump on his heel that wasn&#39;t there before. His heel was bothering him so he checked to see if there was something stuck in his shoe like a rock or whatever and he found nothing and he kept walking and it was getting worse to he checked again and still found nothing and he was just curious, he has read all the paper work and cannot find anything with issues like this with a lump on his heel, it was swollen and it happened right after the shot. He asked if he was daydreaming or has there been anything like this with other people. He reported that he has never had this before and it was all of a sudden he walked in fine but he couldn&#39;t walk out fine, it was strange. Patient was asking if this was normal or something that has been reported. Outcome of events was not recovered.

A 72-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot/batch number and expiration date not reported as Misplaced/discarded), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 (at the age of 72-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in Feb2021 (at the age of 72-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. For the past 10 weeks, since the second dose of vaccination, the muscle pain and weakness had worsened to the point of near immobility. It took both hands to lift a half full coffee cup, and patient could barely manage that. Patient could not raise his arms above shoulder height, his knees and other joints did not want to bend, and he was in constant pain. Patient had had to receive five (5) steroid shots in an attempt to counteract this, and the doctor had stated he could receive no more. Patient contacted his doctor&#39;s office and local health department, but neither could help me. Patient was healthy and had no such issues before the shot, and now he was in the worst condition of my life. All these events with start date 09Mar2021, resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, and received treatment Steroid Shots. Since the vaccination, patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received vaccine on Friday, April 23 at 1:10 PM. Over the next 3 days had a sore arm. The only other symptom was a heart flutter that lasted 20 to 30 seconds on 3 or 4 occasions.  On Tuesday, April 27, I again had a heart flutter, I felt like I was going to faint, my blood pressure dropped to 92/52 while sitting, my temples were sore, and I had a slight elevation in temperature of 1 degree.  I saw the doctor the next day, he ran: 1. blood work (it came back normal), 2. an EKG (which was normal), and 3. ordered a Heart Monitor (I began wearing it the morning May 7 and will wear it until May 21.) For three days my BP was off and on in the 90s/50s range most of the time and I did not feel the best. The doctor suggested that this may be related to my body adjusting to the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, though he is not for sure that it is.  I had Covid at the end of January (1st symptoms  the 19th) and received the Regeneron monoclonal antibody infusion on January 22. . It seemed as though I recovered well within a few days- only a few Heart flutters during the first few days after the infusion.  I waited the prescribed 90 days prior to receiving the vaccine.

Concomitant medications included metoprolol taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; levothyroxine sodium (THYROXINE) taken for thyroid from an unspecified start date and ongoing; hydrocodone taken for pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing; imatinib taken for leukemia in remission from an unspecified start date and ongoing; gabapentin taken for neuropathic pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing; iron taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; folic acid (FOLATE) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; vitamin d nos (VITAMIN D) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and ongoing unspecified gout medicine. The patient previously took morphine; he had a shot of morphine in the emergency room sometime before his COVID vaccine. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 25Mar2021 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility was PRIVACY she thinks. Prior vaccination (4 weeks prior) were none. The patient&#39;s sister reported that they both had their second dose and she forgot to tell the other woman she spoke to about herself because the caller&#39;s focus was on her elderly brother who was 72-years-old. They both received their COVID vaccines in the morning of 16Apr2021, a Friday, and within hours her brother felt very bad. She went downstairs and saw her brother vomiting in the trash can and he just said that he hurt and that he felt nauseated. This continued for a few days, in fact it continued for 4 days. He was beginning to feel better on Monday, but he was still not up to par. Then Tuesday she guesses her brother was feeling better. On Wednesday night she went downstairs and heard him around 2300 to midnight talking to the dogs and then the next morning she found him unresponsive (22Apr2021). Her first thought was that maybe her brother had a stroke so she called 911. In the emergency room he had a CAT (computerized tomography) scan and at first they said that he didn&#39;t have a stroke. But something very unusual was that her brother had a rapid heartbeat and his normal was around 60 but in the emergency room his heartrate was upwards to 120 to 130 to 140. He was then transferred to another hospital where they said the next evening that in fact he did have a stroke even though that first doctor said that he didn&#39;t have a stroke. The doctor didn&#39;t find any further information until 2 days later when the doctor thought her brother already had some blood clots that were thrown into the frontal, temporal and parietal region in his brain. She was a biologist so she can&#39;t say that the COVID vaccine caused this but she thought that Pfizer should be aware of his situation and then she was so focused on her brother that she forgot to tell the other woman the really bizarre things. She had asked certain questions to the doctor based on what her sister was telling her to ask. The caller asked the doctor if her brother was going to be seen by a neurologist and the doctor gave a rambling evasive answer and then turned on his heels and walked out and kicked her out of the hospital. They both had their COVID vaccines in the morning around 1000 or so and she doesn&#39;t know if he was vomiting still the next day or not but her brother felt really bad. He has chronic conditions and he generally just felt bad and he had thought that something was wrong with him. He felt malaise, fatigue, his head hurt and he was nauseated. He ate one bowl of soup that the caller had made for him but he wasn&#39;t really eating. That lasted for about 4 days and then he started to feel better on Tuesday, confirmed to 20Apr2021, and then he felt even better on Wednesday, confirmed to 21Apr2021, because the caller did take him on some trips. He doesn&#39;t drive. Her brother said that he felt feverish and the caller says that he felt feverish to the touch as well but the thermometer said that he didn&#39;t have a fever because it had an error sign when she took his temperature. Unresponsive: Her brother was fine Wednesday night around 2300, maybe midnight, she had heard him downstairs talking to the dogs and she knew that he was okay. Then the next morning, 22Apr2021, she found him slumped into his rollator (his wheelchair with a seat) and he was slumped over and had stuff that looked like had came out of his mouth and he had vomit on legs. He was unresponsive so she called 911 and said that she thought her brother had a stroke. The operator said to lay him flat and the caller was finally able to get him up and then his arm got hung up and the operator said again to get her brother on the floor and get him flat. She understands that this was important and she was able to do it but they all fell down, her brother, her and the rollator. Shortly after this the ambulance had shown up. The ambulance took her brother to the emergency room in town and they said that her brother&#39;s heartrate was fast. She gave them all of the relevant information but she didn&#39;t think to tell them about the COVID vaccine. They said that her brother&#39;s heart was acting eradicate and it was very fast. Again, his normal heartrate is in the 60s and it was going from 110 to 140s and it wasn&#39;t coming down. She told them that when he was unresponsive that she thought he was having agonal breathing. In the emergency room, her brother&#39;s breathing was still not very good and she heard the doctor say that her brother had stopped breathing but then he came back so that&#39;s when he was intubated in the emergency room. They did a CAT scan of his head and his neck and the doctor comes back and said that her brother didn&#39;t have a stroke. But that was not the case according to a different doctor&#39;s later assessment. Approximately around 1430 to 1445 on that Thursday, 22Apr2021, they transferred him to PRIVACY,  where he was in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). His heartrate conditioned to being very fast. He went from the emergency room to the ICU. Thursday when he got transferred to the ICU they didn&#39;t do any diagnostic tests that day, he was still intubated and his heartrate was still up into the next day, Friday, 23Apr2021. It wasn&#39;t until late in the afternoon that a doctor came in and said that her brother did have a stroke he has even had prior strokes too. They had done an MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) on Friday of his brain, which was not what they did in the first emergency room, that showed that he had a stroke in his temporal, frontal and parietal regions of his brain. At first caller states that on Saturday, he opened his eyes but he was still unresponsive essentially but then she says that this statement was wrong because he actually didn&#39;t respond that quickly. He has gone into a coma once before and when he had came out of it a very unpleasant thing happened that was very personal so she was not going to tell it. On Saturday and Sunday the doctor didn&#39;t want to answer the callers questions, this was a different doctor than the first ICU doctor and this one didn&#39;t have good bedside manner. Finally on Monday, 26Apr2021, her brother started responding. He was moving his legs with purpose, he had tried to kick the nurse, and he had made some words. The day before this, on Sunday the caller had brought the priest in to bless her brother and he sort of nodded and he seemed to make movements but he was still not able to talk. Monday he said what sounded like words and then Tuesday he made, what seemed to her like, meaningful statements. She was told that he had an ultrasound of his neck to see if he had any clogged arteries or veins and the nurse said that the test results came back good that their were no clogs. But this was where the whole story just becomes awful. Caller discusses how there were issues with a cousin having power of attorney from 2015 that was supposedly no longer valid according to the caller and she had spoke with administration and then she got kicked out of the hospital on Tuesday because of a question she had asked the doctor about her brother seeing a neurologist. The doctor said that the neurologist makes his own schedule and it might be 10 days or more if he even decided he wanted to see her brother. When the doctor asked the caller how would she like her brother&#39;s care to be she mentioned that he was in a coma before and was being treated for similar circumstances from PRIVACY and that he was seen by a neurologist and she said that maybe her brother should be seen by PRIVACY and the doctor walked out and within minutes she was being escorted out of the hospital for belittling the doctor and calling administration. Now they won&#39;t even let flowers be delivered to her brother. Unfortunately the person who has been involved with him the most, the caller, was now barred from him. She was not saying that this was all due to the Pfizer COVID vaccine but why were they saying that she has a blood clot too. She has had headaches but they may be due to stress. She didn&#39;t feel sick like her brother. She has a question and she was really scared about the answer. She was just now reading that if you&#39;re on immunosuppressant drugs then you&#39;re not supposed to have the COVID vaccine. She asked was that true. Well her brother was in remission for leukemia and he was on a cancer medication called imatinib. Caller declined to speak to medical information about this and says it was already too late because he was already taking it and she doesn&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t stop them. Her brother&#39;s friends have tried to call and they were all getting the same statement, which she believes the hospital was stone walling, but the hospital says that they don&#39;t have a patient by his name and they have even told the florist the same thing. So caller was unsure if her brother has been discharged or not. He didn&#39;t seem to be in the shape to be shipped to a care facility but she doesn&#39;t know. It was hard for her to piece it all together. The hospital wasn&#39;t feeding her brother enough before she left so for all she knows they could be starving him to death and holding nutrition from him. History/ Investigations: His medications were ones that he has been taking for years and she doesn&#39;t know exact start dates for any and if she needs to she can get the dosage information from the pharmacy. Her brother has hid his pills before and he puts them in different bottles, it was a nightmare. He takes a gout medicine and she doesn&#39;t know the name of it. Those were the main ones that he takes other than the cancer medicine she said earlier. And he also takes gabapentin for some of his neuropathic pain and he takes something at night and a few others she thinks. For medical conditions the only thing that she knows was that many years ago he had a blood clot but she can&#39;t really say what year it was. She does know that her brother wasn&#39;t on any blood thinners to he knowledge and not long ago he had an ultrasound of his legs to determine if he had a blood clot but she was not 100 % sure if he had that but she thinks he did. Her brother told her that years ago he had blood clots that were due to weight lifting causing varicose veins and later they collateralized and they found out that the other secondary vessels took over for pumping his blood so it wasn&#39;t a problem. Her concern was can someone from Pfizer talk to her about what&#39;s going on with her brother, she knows Pfizer doesn&#39;t have his records but how will Pfizer be able to determine if this was from the COVID vaccine. She guesses that she was curious about what may of caused the blood clots. She mentioned the COVID vaccine to one doctor and he didn&#39;t seem like she respected her knowledge. She asked was there anything that can be done to help her brother if it was a blood clot. She was upset that the hospital and her wanting her brother to see a neurologist and beginning with a claim that he didn&#39;t have a stroke and then a claim that he did. She thinks that they were not doing enough for her brother and they were just saying oh well, it was all due to a fast heart rate which can happen as a result of the COVID vaccine. She was going to be honest, she was exhausted and she can&#39;t keep talking for a long time. She asked if she can call medical information back later when she was more refreshed. Consumer further stated that her brother had complaints of feeling ill, feverish and having no appetite. Caller stated that the next Thursday she found her brother unconscious, heart rate was elevated 120 to140 beats per minute and that her brother had a stroke. The outcome was recovered on 21Apr2021 for the events Malaise, Nauseated, Fatigue, Headache and Appetite absent; recovering for the event Vomiting; and unknown for the rest of the events.

                                                He received his vaccine, he had a slightly sore arm.  A couple days after the vaccine he was lying in bed and he started out one sentence in jibberish.  He realized that he had done that, paused and apologized to his wife and it happened again in jibberish and he stopped again and he looked at his wife and said &#34;that&#39;s not good&#34;.  He then found out that the entire time that he was speaking that way, and was aware that he was not making any sense.  The next day he noticed that he was dragging his right foot when he tried to walk.  He made an APT to his doctor and she said that he had a TIA, but the effects had cleared.   The doctor told him to call the cardiologist office and to get an appointment with them, and he saw a cardiologist.  The cardiologist said that he wants him to loose weight and gave him a prescription for Plavix which he is taking.  Ever since he moved to Arizona he has had spontaneous nosebleeds, and have been getting worse every year since being there.  In 2020 they have been the worst that he has had.  He has had nasal cautery twice.  A week after being on the Plavix he had another bleed, and he was advised to stop taking his 81 mg aspirin.  Then a week later still on Plavix he had another nosebleed and this bleed was so bad that he ended up going to UC, and it stopped by the time he got there, and lasted for more than an hour.  He called his cardiologist and his PCP and told them that he was not taking anymore Plavix until the nosebleeds stopped.  He has since then talked to his ENT and told him that the cauterization is not working and is having the nosebleeds of his life.  He suggested that he have surgery for his deviated septum, and has to have clearance from your PCP or cardiologist to have that surgery.   In the past 5 days he has had 3 nosebleeds.  His cardiologist scheduled him a stress test, and also a carotid ultrasound, as well as a CAT scan of his brain and echocardiogram.

                                                On 03/23/2021 I had the second dose and I had a little bit of sore arm and a little bit lethargic for about 7-8 hours. On 05/04/2021 I woke up at 6:30 am and I felt just fine so I went back to sleep and woke up again at 8:30 and right away I knew something was wrong, I felt really weird. I could not hear, I lost hearing on my right ear for about 24 hours. I started to get vertigo and started to throw up and I vomited for about an hour. My wife decided to take me to the ER and they did an MRI and determined the stroke was in my cerebellum and that would explained the vertigo but that do not explained the hearing of loss. They gave me a blood thinner and diuretic. They thought is was Ménière&#39;s disease because of the hearing loss but after doing the MRI and CAT scan they determined it was a stroke. I was in the hospital for 3 days. I still have some balance problems and dizziness but I am getting better gradually.

It progressively got worse.  Went to all around the shoulder area and extreme/piercing when moving arm and shoulder.  Also clicking on movement.   It has been over 5 months, and I am still dealing with this.  Saw Dr. (family doctor) in March.  Xray done and referred to ortho doc at Ortho clinic (Dr.).  Dr.  prescribed an anti-inflammatory med.  Dr. stated because the pain was from a shot and not injury, this med might work.  He additionally suggested steroid injections if it did not work.  Also suggested physical therapy.  I chose home physical therapy to no avail.  It is now June 29th and I am still having difficulty driving and difficulty performing other day to day activities.

Two days after second shot, right arm lost about 90% muscle tone/useage.  Both arms continued this condition for 30 days (60 days for left arm).  After 30 more days, (around April,) condition started to improve until June at which muscle tone and useage improved to 70%.  By July, most strength and tone have returned, except some minor weakness continues, mostly in hands and shoulder muscles.  Doctor felt I may have had COVID and didn&#39;t know it.  No other explanation seems to fit.

It was a muscle pain in my calf and behind my knee. I took Tylenol and went to bed. The following day the pain was less intense, and I wore a compressive knee brace. On the second morning the pain had subsided and I could walk with a limp. The following day, all symptoms had disappeared. I did not seek medical advice.

Furthermore, he noticed in Jan2021 there was a cycle that continued where he did not have high temperature in the morning, his temperature was around 99 after breakfast and then his temperature would go up to 100 or 101 towards the evening.

He also had a covid test that was negative on 21Jan2021. He then added that he also had a negative covid test on 18Jan2021; it was not the rapid test but a test that started with a &#34;p&#34;. With these, his primary care provider was very much concerned, and he had a battery of tests done then he was discovered to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) on 22Jan2021. He informed that his primary care provider asked him to go into the office since the primary care provider was convinced that it was something more than just a reaction to the Pfizer covid vaccine. He had more tests on 22Jan2021 and that was when he was diagnosed with a UTI. It was a minimal UTI, not of any consequence, that when the doctor pushed on his bladder it hurt on 22Jan2021. He then received an intravenous antibiotic in the emergency room for the UTI but confirmed that he was not admitted. He stated that he has never had a reaction to any medication he has taken before. He then asked if he should get the second dose, the &#34;booster&#34; of the covid vaccine. He admitted he was quite reluctant to get the second dose that was scheduled for 02Feb2021 and his primary care provider advised against getting the second dose. The outcome of the event dizziness/woozy and dizziness occurred when he stood up to leave/had dizziness and it went away and possibly occurred because he got up too quick was recovered on 12Jan2021. The outcome of the event fever was recovered on 21Jan2021. The patient was recovering from UTI.

It took me forty five minutes to get out of bed after numerous attempts.  I also experience dizziness, balance issues.  In all honesty, it was as if I had gotten Covid all over again.  I had it in late August and all of September.  The second day after the shot, I experienced lack of strength, but not as bad as the first day, and whole body muscle aches.  The third day after,  was about the same and after that, things started getting a  little better.

                                                Swelling, soreness at injection site just after shot. Uneasy sleep, awoke the following morning in a sweat, with overall discomfort and nausea, began to retch and vomit for nearly 13 hrs. throughout the only comfort was to sit in a hot shower till the hot water ran out sometime falling into a deep sleep, I did this many times through the day, Accompanying this was a general fog and complete loss of equilibrium, extreme weakness. this made it difficult to move from bed to bath or anywhere in my home. I am writing this at 5:13 am Mar  6 and find it hard to gather thoughts.

Now, one week later, have severe pain/muscle spasms in both legs. Specifically biceps femoris and &#34;hamstring muscles.&#34;  Very &#34;stiff&#34; as well. Difficult (sometimes impossible) to bend down, very painful to walk.  Using a walker to get around. Taking gabapentin mentholated patches, occasional Aleve (naproxen) for pain.

Had no control of body functions and urinated all over myself. Could not get strength to get off the toilet. Needed help with that and back to bed. Fell on the way there. Wife was able to help me crawl back to bed. A few hours later had to urinate again, but could not get out of bed. No control no strength. Was half on the toilet and could not get myself straight on due to literally no body strength. Fell off the toilet, could not move at all. Had to call my son over to get me up. I was sick all day long. Later in the day I was able to get up a bit and walk but not steadily. Tylenol helped. Later that night I was feeling better. By the next day I was pretty well back to mysllf

It was noticeable when rising from a prone position - such as getting out of bed.   I contacted my rheumatologist, who advised me to stop taking the methotrexate for two weeks after receiving the vaccine.  I have not resumed the methotrexate, and have received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on February 28.  No recurrence of the dizziness after the second dose.

Could not stand up.  Once helped to my feet, could not walk unassisted.  A friend came by to see how I was  and I have zero recollection of him being here.  My wife got me into bed, and a few hours later I &#34;came back to consciousness&#34; with a massive headache.  The following morning was &#34;back to earth&#34; so to speak, but for two more days felt achy, tired, lethargic.

When he woke up at 3 AM on 3/12/2021 to go to the restroom he noticed his right leg felt weak.  He stumbled to the restroom.  Then he went back to sleep.  When he woke up again at 7 or 8 AM his right leg felt weaker.  He noticed balance issues, gait issues and bladder urgency more than usual.  He walked with difficulty using a cane and went to the ER.  He realized in the hospital that he had difficulty with writing due to coordination issues in the right upper extremity with some weakness.  He was having a lot of right leg spasms.

                                                Generally did not feel good for several days afterward.  Dizziness and balance problem lasted  about a week.  Worst for me was a serious deterioration of my eyesight (estimated 50% reduction) for 7 days and slight improvement to  about 25% eyesight reduction in the second week, gradually improving to near normal in the third week after the first dose. At this point I&#39;ll mention that after the second dose, I had almost no adverse reactions, except for, again, an eyesight difficulty, a lesser reduction (about 25%) in my eyesight for four days, improving to normal after about a week.

It was him that wasn&#39;t solid; Headache; This is a spontaneous case received from a contactable consumer reported behalf of her husband. A 73 years old patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (lot/Batch: EN6206) on 13Mar2021 at single dose on left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was High blood pressure (Treatment of high blood pressure: &#34;Lisinopril dose one a day and dose is 12.5 according to it, it says here is HCTZ 10-12.5 mg it&#39;s oral tablet takes one at breakfast time); And then something else he takes because we had a storm earlier in summer, he was working where he works and wind just blew him face down into concrete side wall, but he put his arm up to resist it off, so he has been back and forth with his neurologist on this.&#34; There is another one that he does take because of hitting the side walk when I told him the wind blew him the side walk, he put his arm up but he gets a little dizzy once in a while because of that. It&#39;s Meclizine 25 mg, tablet, afternoon and evening 2 times a day.&#34; Concomitant drugs included Lisinopril, HCTZ and Meclizine. This past three weeks ago, &#39;my husband and I&#39; (not clear) had our first injection for the Pfizer and within 4 minutes he was showing all kinds of reaction to it and he know he does not have reactions to very much of anything. I have no idea like it was something within the Pfizer medication that he was allergic to, allergic reaction. He stood on the floor I didn&#39;t figure out why he was standing up, he said the floor doesn&#39;t look steady to me which meant he was a little weak or dizzy whatever I don&#39;t know, so I reached over and I looked at his forehead and I said his forehead was dripping and I touched his forehead and it was cold, so the cold sweat coming from the forehead.&#34; He was excessively tired for almost 2 weeks. Like I said he kept on standing up the couple of times and I said what&#39;s the matter and he said I don&#39;t feel like I am standing on a solid ground and I said yes you are, then he told me a few days later that his feet bothered him after that shot, he couldn&#39;t really describe what it was, but he told me it went right down to his feet and that&#39;s probably why he didn&#39;t feel right. So, anyway I end up calling over an RN and she and another RN had to take him over to take his blood pressure, his blood pressure went down and now only he had high blood pressure, he took his medication (Unspecified Medication) that morning like he always does and it went down to 107/70 and when they gave him a small bottle of water to drink and they said just stand up and take it. Took the medication stood up and it was 132/80, it was probably more than his normal. So, I mean I couldn&#39;t understand what was happening that he was tired through, excessive tired to the point that he didn&#39;t want to go to work, so I mean I didn&#39;t question what&#39;s wrong specially when I looked over and his forehead just dripping, for approximate 4 minutes after the injection. So, I mean I really don&#39;t know to have been that way. Then often had, he told me he had &#39;more&#39; (not clear) saliva for a week and a half, it&#39;s just saliva in his mouth that kept on foaming up. I had noted to if this was anything that was never him, he has never had lot of saliva in his mouth anyway. But, this side of him of course it showed it was working and that lasted almost 2 weeks as well, 2 week I think 2 weeks. And now he is starting to feel better but he didn&#39;t feel well but better than 2 weeks after the first injection. I had taken that was on 13th, 13th took him to his doctor and he recommended to not take a second one. He felt very weak, I mean this took 2 weeks to go away. He did mention that when he stood up he didn&#39;t feel like he was standing on solid ground and I know this as I have been there probably for more than 50 years, so of course he was. He received them, his blood pressure dropped to a 107/70 went that down, changing back to 132/80, actually they gave him a bottle of water in between and he did drink water for it so. And his forehead was dripping cold sweat and he told me later that he felt something strange in feet and that&#39;s why he was standing up I couldn&#39;t figure that part out in fact he was on solid floor or solid ground, so I am thinking the weakness set in him very quickly. So, that he was really dizzy, I don&#39;t know and that&#39;s why I said I called over the RN and she grabbed another RN and they helped him over to take his blood pressure they took it down it was almost 107/70. Now if he has got high blood pressure, it just the blood pressure going to be really in morning and this is at 5:30 at night, doesn&#39;t mean like and he is a lot to me. And he had excess saliva in his mouth seem to be foaming in his mouth. I don&#39;t know if you had any of these reactions or unless it&#39;s just him I really don&#39;t know. When probed for the start date of the events (event not specified), reporter stated, &#34;Approximate 5:39, maybe 5:39, 5:40 in the evening which was last month, that on the 13th.&#34; Reporter confirmed that patient would not go for second dose of vaccine and that reporter is due for second dose on this Saturday. And according to what I understand and what I was told 107/70 wasn&#39;t trending down, to me it was, but I am not a doctor nor a nurse or any other professional to have said not in medical field but when his forehead started dripping cold sweat and he was acting little strange and standing up and what is wrong because I was right next to him, I said what is wrong, he said I feel like I am falling down. The biggest one that bothers him beside being also retired for 2 weeks. He keeps on getting this foam in his mouth from saliva, excess saliva foam and that has no idea what&#39;s close to. High blood pressure, he had taken that tablet (Unspecified Medication) that morning. Actually the tiredness is gone away, the blood pressure is back to normal, like I said he was absolutely tired for 2 weeks and I think it coincide with Pfizer&#39;s 1 to 2 days. He is also having a headache and he just take Tylenol for that. Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow up attempts needed. Information about lot/ batch number not requested.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

Once home, my wife asked what happened? I was Flushed. Red. I then noticed my hands were also red. I sat down the rest of the day.  And the next day I was no longer Flushed. Next two days I was fatigued and my arm hurt. After that I was ok.

Came in from work and had to lay down because I was very tired, upset stomach, low fever, and very weak legs.  All I could do was sleep.  I was sick for 6 or 7 days.   After about 10 days, my feet began to swell and my toes started turning purple and black.  My feet were extremely painful and I was unable to walk.  Over 3 months after the shot I am still having trouble with my feet.

Never had a fever. All of a sudden, around 2:30PM all dissipated, it was all gone and I was fine. A week later I called my PCP because the symptoms came back - the lethargy. He suggested me to go to the ER. I went and could barely write my name on the sign in sheet at the hospital. They did 5 COVID tests and 4 of them were negative. I was at the ER for 3 days and finally was admitted and stayed for 11 days.  I was sent home with oxygen and my levels are finally getting back to 92/93.  I can&#39;t walk at this time. I lost 17 lbs and if I try to walk my lungs shut down. ( I went to the ER n 01/07 and was discharged on the 17th - I was also at the ER the week before when they tested me and it kept coming back negative) My pulmonary MD

I was there for 15 mins. They called the EMT and took me across the street to the ER. They did blood test and EKG and my BP was still high when I got there. The EKG and BP. x-ray of my heart was ok. They had to keep me there 4 hours to re-do test to make sure I didn&#39;t have a heart attack. MY BP was coming down but still high when they sent me home.  I sent an email to my PCP and she said there is a lot of side effects with the vaccine. After two days I was fine.

A 74-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9263 and Expiration Date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 17Feb2021 (at the age of 74-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Lyme disease in the past that was treated. He take no day to day medications. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that patient wanted to report experience with BNT162B2. On 17Feb2021 patient received BNT162B2 around mid-day. First day he got the COVID-19 vaccine, by late afternoon his skin was feeling very, very irritated. He was feeling irritated. Started sensing aggression and anger in himself. Couldn&#39;t get comfortable. Doesn&#39;t know if this is an expected result because he hasn&#39;t seen this. Started to get extremely tired. Did have to lay down a couple times later that afternoon to early evening. Worse thing was his whole body felt irritated. 18Feb2021 (Yesterday), he didn&#39;t have the same feeling. He had a very good morning. Early afternoon started feeling chills and couldn&#39;t get warm. Got into bed with big quilts. Chill sensation lasted two to three hours. Sees that chills are an expected result. 19Feb2021 (Today), so far he has had a good day. He is fatigued now this afternoon. That would be the extent of anything unusual for him. Most concerning was how he was feeling the first day. He doesn&#39;t think he was being a good driver at the time. Probably thinks there should be a recommendation to try and not drive or have a designated driver. Patient would like to know if the anger and aggression was within the range of expected results. Stated he doesn&#39;t know if there was real value in knowing it at this time unless there are booster shots that come out in the next year or so. Stated he wanted to report to Pfizer so it was known there are other things than what was being seen. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I WAS ALSO VERY NAUSEOUS AND ON APRIL 6TH AND 7TH I EXPERIENCED DEEP SWEATS DURING THE NIGHT.  AT THAT POINT THE PAIN STARTED TO DECREASE AND I STARTED TO SLOWLY GET MOTION BACK IN MY ARM.  I WENT TO AN ORTHOPAEDIC DOCTOR WHO ASSURED ME THAT THIS WAS A REACTION TO THE SHOT.

It was an ordeal getting him up.  He could not help himself.  I had to pull him up by his tshirt and underpants.  Could not raise his arms or head.   Helpless.

This 74-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered on the arm left on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;maybe I don&#39;t know 6198, it&#39;s GN or EN&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, broken back, breathing problem because of his heart and lung, his lungs have problem, he had some nodules in it, and kidney stone once 25 years ago, 5 little stones. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had a reaction, it is the worst reaction he has ever had in his life, the pain he had, he was almost paralyzed and couldn&#39;t walk after vaccine and he had to get a wheelchair because he couldn&#39;t stand on his feet. He ended up in the emergency room. The vaccine put him out of work, and now he can work some. He is trying to make it up in two days, today and tomorrow to finish up. He was very upset and wanted to know why this happened to him. The patient stated that other people he talked to had no reaction, if they had a fever or anything it was gone in a coupled days, but he ended up in the emergency room. On 01Mar2021, patient had his first dose and at 02:30, he got out of the facility and came out okay with no problem. At 21:00, all of a sudden he saw that he could not stand up on his feet and he fell awake. He waited in the bed, people around him got worried. Eventually, he asked them to bring wheelchair, maybe he can drive. He drove home with his wife to the emergency from his house and he got admitted in emergency and he was screaming so bad, he did not believe in his life, he never heard somebody doing like this. He felt like somebody getting chills like somebody cutting his side, on his lower abdomen on the right side. It&#39;s underside of the lower abdomen, he had slight pain every single day, sometime excruciating, he took Ibuprofen for it. He thought he had a kidney stone because he had it once 25 years ago, 5 little stones, so they took him to emergency, took him to the CT scan. They didn&#39;t find anything, but the pain was excruciating and in the emergency room everybody thought the crazy man is here who is screaming. He couldn&#39;t control his scream. He couldn&#39;t walk, he couldn&#39;t move. Every movement was like you put a knife on the cutting, it was that bad. His second dose was due on 22Mar2021. He went to the pharmacy and asked them the number and let them know that he had a reaction like this and they called somebody and said to cancel the shot. They cancelled it. That day for 3 days, patient had the pain, it was slowly because he had to take eventually oxycodone. The doctor advised in the emergency room that nothing was wrong, just to slow down the pain but he was not allowed to take the oxycodone. He took the 10 mg oxycodone and the pain which was an hour and a half was a little bit down. After 3 hours, it was a little better, he didn&#39;t want to scream, it was gone but the pain was still there for at least 3 days, really bad. He was taking ibuprofen and a muscle relaxant. He did all those things and still I have the pain left and he did not know what to do with that. The lab test he had, he had been okay, he did not have any problem. He got the result on 22Mar2021. Outcome of the events pain and abdominal pain was not recovered and of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient concomitant medications includes, zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN CR 12.5mg) still ongoing for insomnia, taking it from years as patient comes from family of insomniacs &amp; high-pressure jobs; triazolam (HALCION) (0.25mg) still ongoing for sleep, rivaroxaban (XARELTO) (20mg) started taking in 2012 for pulmonary embolism &amp; has been on blood thinners, aspirin acetylsalicylic acid (low dose aspirin of 65mg) for supplemental blood thinner still ongoing. Patient has history of seasonal allergies and its prime time right now so its compounding. Relevant medical history includes, both knee replacement, pulmonary embolism, bad blood pressure problems maybe 5 years ago all on an unspecified date. The patient historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number: EN6198), at Right shoulder on 06Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.  On 27Mar2021, When the patient got home from his shot, he had no problems at all and he went to bed. Being an old guy, he got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and he lost his balance and took a nasty fall, so has a bummed up knee and stuff too, so that is what aggravates it. He clarifies he has a bum knee and nose after having the fall. Since he took the fall and has the bum knee, it is kind of a chore going up and down stairs.  On 28Mar2021 the patient experienced general sense of weakness , general tiredness. It has been over a week and he wants to know if that is unusual. Patient adds there was kind of a brain fog thing From: 28 Mar 2021  going on. The brain fog concerns him because he has to get his taxes done. He was still having trouble with the nose bleeds, which sort of compounds his misery, but he is getting better. It seems the side effects are getting incrementally better every day, but its not like he wakes up and its completely gone. It&#39;s like some prolonged illness. His side effects are getting marginally better. He is fairly clear headed today and he even had the nerve to take a short drive to the supermarket and stuff, although he wouldn&#39;t want to drive cross country in terms of being able to concentrate. But doing his taxes, will take a little work. Patient stated in the beginning he had muscle aches and chills from: 28Mar2021, but that went away after a day or two. Patient stated he had muscle aches/chills for a couple of days. He feels he has recovered completely as far as he knows. He never had nausea. On an Unspecified date patient mentions feeling a little short of breath, but states that could be more of the asthma thing. He does not recall having injection site pain at all. The tiredness is definitely ongoing, but has improved. He clarifies it has probably improved incrementally but doesn&#39;t really want to classify it as improvement because it might be temporary. He did not have a headache until he was waiting on the phone to speak to this call handler. On 28Mar2021 the patient experienced muscle pain for a few days and that sort of cleared up. This was the same with joint pain. After the big bang, clarified as the fall, everything proceeded. He still feels the muscle and joint pain, only in his knee, but its starting to fade. His knee was really a beautiful shade of purple, but it seems to be fading and hurting less so that is recovering, too. This pain is secondary. The side effect was the dizziness, stiffness, and inability to keep his balance. Caller states he was stiff as a board and he just couldn&#39;t move fast enough to get one foot in front of the other, and he landed on his knee, so the pain in his knee was not directly caused by shot. He felt fine at the center where he took the shot. He had to wait 15-20 minutes after the shot. He felt fine, drove home, went to bed, and in the middle of the night, it all started. He still feels a little dizzy and unsure and has been using a cane. He got both knees replaced and is worried that he damaged the actual replacement joint as opposed to just the muscle tissue. He just doesn&#39;t trust himself without the cane. He hasn&#39;t fallen over and hasn&#39;t passed out. He feels stiff all over but that could be from not getting to the gym and working out and not doing his regular work outs. Patient stated that the lethargy might be slightly better. He was making himself do more but he still gets really tired and it was really hard for him to get motivated, like to get out of the chair and go downstairs. He went to the supermarket and had to unload his car in stages- he took the perishables out and rested for a while and then went back out and got another couple of bags and then rested again. He just could not work straight through like he normally does. States he is in pretty good shape normally. He does not feel particularly great and that is the reason that he called to find out if this should last this long. Patient stated that he does have high blood pressure and heart problems. In fact at the end of the month, he will be going in for a catherization with Dr. (Name) so that was another reason he wants to have this stuff cleared up and out of the way. He still has dizziness and weakness. Patient stated that last night was the first night of decent sleep he had got. He has insomnia actually and he takes two sleep medications, but even taking those and washing it down with a glass of wine, he could not sleep for a whole week. He clarifies even with the Halcion and Ambien CR, it didn&#39;t work for a whole week- he could not sleep which adds to the brain fog. Typically, he goes to sleep, wakes up after a couple of hours, and then he is awake so he reads for a few hours and then takes the second medication and then sleep the rest of the night. He ends up getting a full 8-9 hours of sleep normally and he did that last night.   On 08Apr2021 he developed a pounding headache but it was probably independent of the shot. He took Tylenol and he is okay now, but he just thought it was ironic that he had one while waiting to talk to Pfizer when he hadn&#39;t had one before. Outcome of the events muscle pain and joint pain, dizziness and stiffness, Feeling unwell were ongoing and those of other events were unspecified.  No further information was provided or obtained

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 74years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL9262) on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 74years) for Covid-19 immunization and stated no reactions. Medical history included high blood pressure and diabetes but are all currently under control and feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered. It was reported that in the past the doctors thought he experienced TIA (transient ischemic attack) but wasn&#39;t sure if that was accurate. Concomitant medications included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL), trazodone (TRAZODONE), insulin (INSULIN), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and prednisone (PREDNISONE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that on 19Feb2021 the patient received the 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine and stated he remember feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered earlier. On Sunday 21Feb2021, the reporter (patient&#39;s wife) began noticing that the patient was showing symptoms of a stroke. The patient&#39;s one leg was rapidly kicking, and his speech began to slur. The patient was then rushed to ER (emergency room) and hospitalized. At the hospital it was confirmed that the patient was having a stroke. The patient recovered and was doing rehab for his leg. Few weeks later, the patient had an accident in his home while getting up to go to the bathroom and fell. The patient was rushed to the Trauma center. The patient&#39;s wife was upset as she carried their vaccine cards to the trauma center to confirm to staff that the patient did not need another Covid vaccine shot and later found out that the patient was given a 3rd (Moderna Covid vaccine) at the trauma center. The patient stated that he does not think the vaccine was related but was upset that the trauma center did not listen to her to take the info with the complete vaccine card present to avoid 3rd shot from another brand. The patient&#39;s insulin levels are under control, but the reporter was concerned when the patient does not eat within a certain timeframe. The outcome of events stroke and speech disorder was recovered on an unspecified date; outcome of event fall was unknown.

A contactable consumer reported that a 74-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162b2(COMIRNATY, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207, Expiration: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 19Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history includes Arthritis (arthritis is in his right foot only and his big toe, diagnosed in 2017 or 2018) and Concomitant medication were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY) on 26Feb2021 for Covid-19 immunisation and Unspecified steroid shot. Stated reaction was three to four days. First shot got caller and patient down for a week. Second shot got caller down for three days. At first, patient&#39;s reaction was running like hers. Patient had a dry cough on an unspecified date in 2021. Was going for a COVID test today. Last week patient started running a fever on an unspecified date in 2021 and his legs were extremely weak on 14Apr2021. Has to hold onto something to go through the house on 14Apr2021. He was moving a little better, but not much. Patient had to go to doctor for his foot. Has terrible arthritis in the big toe on his right foot. Gets steroid shot every three months. Three weeks and four days after second COVID shot everything seemed to have worn off. The PA put the shot in his foot and it bruised the patient. Patient still has bruises on an unspecified date in 2021. Got the steroid shot in his big toe and two days later the weakness hit a second time. It really wiped him out. Caller cannot help patient get up and down. Patient was struggling with his legs and was aching. Wants to know if a steroid shot on top of the COVID shot and that close after would cause another reaction? The PA said it was ok to get a steroid shot three weeks after. Patient started having these reactions and doesn&#39;t know if it was the COVID shot. Has had steroid shots every 3 months for 4 years. Has never had this kind of reaction. Patient didn&#39;t think about getting the steroid shot because he seemed to be feeling fine. Reaction started the next morning and it was even worse on an unspecified date in 2021. By the third day after the shot he was down and caller couldn&#39;t help patient get up. It scared the caller. Patient also broke out in a rash across his shoulders and down both arms. States her husband has had both shots and he has been having issues since the second one n 19MAR2021. Reporter states 3 weeks and 4 days after the second vaccine, her husband had to have a steroid shot in his foot because he has terrible arthritis in his right foot. Reporter states the patient has had a flare up since then with weakness in his legs and a rash on his chest. States the only difference this time is that he had just had the second Covid vaccine 3 weeks prior. States he has not had steroid reactions in the past, and she feels like this reaction was because of the Covid vaccine. Clarifies the shot in his foot was on 13Apr2021 and she does not know what steroid was injected. States it was 3weeks and 4 days between the steroid injection and the vaccine. States maybe they should war people not to get a steroid shot for a longer time after the vaccine. States after the first vaccine for about 5 days they were just laid out. States they ate soup and whatever they could warm up in the microwave. States his ear doctor said if they reacted to the first shot they must have had Covid at sometimes. States she doesn&#39;t know, they never got tested before but they didn&#39;t have any symptoms. States her husband&#39;s test yesterday was negative. Weakness in the Legs AE: States for the last 2 days, he could not even get up on his own and she can&#39;t lift him because he was bigger than she was. Rash was states it was not itching or anything, just a rash. States it was odd because she has had hives, and this was just broken out. Clarifies the rash was across his upper back, chest, and down both arms on 14Apr2021. States it was kind of like speckled on his body like the measles on an unspecified date in 2021. States the patient was 74 years old and he had measles when he was a kid just like she did, so it is not the measles. States the patient had a Covid 19 test done yesterday and it came back negative, so he doesn&#39;t have Covid. She doesn&#39;t know what it was. Treatment: states he was taking Motrin for the Aching. States she does not know if the reaction was because the PA did the injection, it had always been the doctor that had given the injection. Caller states she thinks it was getting the steroid injection on top of receiving the Covid shot. States the both received their vaccines because they couldn&#39;t get a shot because they weren&#39;t giving shots at her age, so when offered them the vaccine, they jumped on it. Yes, last Monday to his Nurse Practitioner, did not address the weakness in his legs because did not know what to do for that. She did not even say what she thought it was, said he needed to see someone about that but does not know who to see, does not know whether to go to the ER or who to go to. Not that emergent but when doctor does not know what to treat with worrisome. She was calling about to finish the report and to speak with the Medical department regarding if this has been reported before or if any information on the Covid vaccine and steroid injections. He received the 1st dose on 26Feb2021 and the 2nd dose on 19Mar2021. She mentioned that both of them experienced achiness, sore all over after the 1st dose and flu-like symptoms on an unspecified date in 2021 after both doses. Her husband however, had muscle weakness on his legs after the 2nd dose. On 13Apr2021, about 3 weeks and 4 days after the 2nd dose, her husband received a steroid shot on his right foot. They noticed that the weakness on his legs became extreme, to which he had trouble standing up and has to hold on to something to stand up as he cannot support himself. He also had a rash on his trunk, back, and down his arms. She mentioned that the rash was not itchy but was speckled like measles. They were wondering if this has been reported and if it was possibly an interaction between the vaccine and steroid. They mentioned that they already consulted with their HCP but said that they really cannot tell. Outcome of his legs were extremely weak, has to hold onto something to go through the house was not recovered while with other event rash is across his upper back, chest, and down both arms, Achy all over was recovered on 22Mar2021 and flu-like symptoms after both doses and Sore all Over was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021, while with other events was unknown.  Follow up attempts were needed. Further information is expected.

Medical history included slight stroke from 2012, seizure disorder from 1972 and ongoing (She says her husband did have a seizure disorder since his car accident in 1972, but he hadn&#39;t had a seizure in years), road traffic accident from 1972 (Caller says her husband had a car accident in 1972 and had some injuries from that), injury from 1972 (Caller says her husband had a car accident in 1972 and had some injuries from that).

The consumer reported that her husband ended up going to the ER and spending 2.5 weeks in hospital after the second dose. She says it started out like a stroke, he lost vision in his left eye temporarily then couldn&#39;t use his left arm, couldn&#39;t raise it or use his hand or wiggle his fingers. She says that ended up being temporary too. She says he then took a seizure before the ambulance got there, so when he got to the hospital they assumed it was stroke and a seizure and he ended up in intensive care unit. She says as days went on and they did MRIs and brain scans, stuff like that, they found no evidence of a stroke said it was a seizure that caused it, and that next day he got his vison back after he was there overnight in the intensive care unit, and could use his arm, raise his arm, and hold things with his left hand. She says it was 20Apr, 20 days later, that this occurred and he was admitted to the hospital. The patient was home now after spending 2.5 weeks in the hospital. She says he is home and doing ok, he is back to how he was. She says that they did give him a seizure medicine.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: LE3301), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 12Jan2021 at 15:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included belief that he had agent orange and tiredness. The patient did not have additional vaccines administered on the same date as the Pfizer vaccine and did not have vaccinations within four weeks. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received a flu shot in October (year unspecified). On 12Jan2021, the patient was throwing up. The patient stated that his whole body has gone, it did not work anymore, his legs have gone out, and was having headaches on 13Jan2021. The patient initially stated that the feeling that his body did not work anymore started six hours after he got the vaccine. He later clarified and stated it started on 13Jan2021. He further clarified that what he meant by the body did not work was issues with his lower extremities, he cannot walk and he was having a lot of headaches. The throwing up started on the evening of 12Jan2021. He could not get up to go to the bathroom. He had a couple of episodes of throwing up. He confirmed the throwing up has resolved, but was unable to provide any additional details. He also added that he was feeling very cold on 13Jan2021. The headaches left him concerned.

No abdominal pain.  No vomiting or diarrhea.  No black or bloody stools.  No dizziness.  Today he almost fell and the son had to catch him.  He did not suffer any trauma.  He offers no symptoms of pain.  Here he is fully awake and alert.  Nothing to clinically suspect a stroke.  His vitals are stable.  Chest x-ray shows nothing acute.  Creatinine is better than baseline.  Electrolytes are stable.  Troponin reassuring.  He had no chest pain or shortness of breath to suspect angina.  Spoke to the wife via telephone, he is getting so weak that he was unable to walk.  Paramedics report they had lift him as he could not take a step.  He was unable to ambulate here in the emergency room.  At this time it does not seem like I can safely discharge him home.

He was taking small steps and could barely walk and control his movements.  I held on to him as he tried to get to the bathroom.  All evening he had trouble walking and was unable to control his urination.  He could not hold it and peed down his pant legs.  This incontinence continued all evening and into the night.  He got up three times to use the bathroom that night while sleeping and could not hold his urination.  The next morning these reactions passed and he was able to walk and urinate normally.  He experienced fatigue over the next few days.  I would say he felt normal by Friday of that week.

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

                                                On March 15 I started experiencing pain in both hips as I was walking.  This pain continued and a few days later I started to experience pain in my lower back in addition to the pain in my hips.  It was very hard to walk and if I went too far or long I had to stop and wait for the pain to lessen.  The pain had lessened but is still present.  on about March 20/21 I noticed a blister on the index finger of my right hand.  A rash showed up on my left arm in the area of my wrist on March 23.  It is now March 25 and the rash all over my whole body.  It itches and at times is painful.

Increased diazepam, meclizine but little help. I am not sure the vaccine made tinnitus worse, but I do think it was a trigger. I am still experiencing tinnitus. I am in the process of trying to use Effexor (getting ENT team involved.)

Follow up (04Feb2021): This is a follow up spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse was processed together along with initial information.   A 75-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for Injection, batch/lot number and Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 75 years), as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included blood pressure, kidney stones. Concomitant medications were unknown (Nurse stated, &#34;Not that I know of, he is taking allergy medicine, I think .&#34;). On an unknown date (a day or two after vaccination) in Jan2021, the patient had experienced dizziness ever since he got it, he is able to drive but caller is concerned (he is 75 years old male). He has been continuing dizzy from nine days. Caller wanted to know about dizziness and how long it lasts. The patient was kind of ignored and did not had any treatment. Outcome of the event was reported as not recovered. The causality was reported as the nurse stated, &#34;It is just said like maybe it is caused with vaccine. He is 75 years old and I don&#39;t know, it could be his heart, I don&#39;t know (not clarified). The dizziness, when I look it at on Pfizer, it says that there may be like a severe reaction and that will be within 24 to 48 hours, and he is still experiencing.&#34;  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (16Apr2021): This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

                                                On March 8 we went and got the 2nd vaccine and he came home with a fever and confusion and I guess dementia just seeming crazy. He was eating dinner on March 9 sitting at the bar with my Mom and for whatever reason when she got back to him (with 5minutes) he was on the floor balled up in a ball, all his muscles were tight- it was hard for us to get him to stretch or even move, unable to move or control his bowels. I went and got him and put him in bed, in the middle of the night he woke up and was going crazy. My Mom called the ambulance and they took him to the hospital and he stayed for 3 days. They got him some Occupation therapy and they were able to snap him out  a little bit. They helped him walk a little it was hard because he has only one arm. We ended up taking him to a nursing home for physical rehab for him to snap out of it but after 2 weeks in the home his brain and cognition and physical abilities deteriorated everyday. To the point we had to send him to a behavioral health hospital who tried to get him on medication to keep him from getting violent- he was there for 31 days and sent back to nursing home and lasted 3 weeks and then he passed away. It was just rapid exponential deteriorated from day to day and was unbelievable to watch.  Every Dr. that saw him said that the vaccine was a contributor to his rapid decline.

After fully vaccinated I was a little dizzy and a little nauseous those symptoms did clear up. I went to for the annual physical, with no symptoms, the doctors office did an EKG and found 3rd degree high blockage. the doctor suggested to go to a cardiologist. I did and the cardiologist performed another EKG and found the same results, 3rd degree high blockage. The cardiologist also had me wear a heart monitor for three days. I am wearing that until tomorrow. Last year my test wee almost perfect.
