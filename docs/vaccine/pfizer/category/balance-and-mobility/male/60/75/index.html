Medical history included diabetes, stent, and cholesterol. Concomitant medication included metformin for diabetes, atorvastatin from 2009 (also reported as Jan2020) for cholesterol, ticagrelor (BRILINTA, NDC: 01860776-60, LOT: MM0189, EXP: Apr2023), saxagliptin hydrochloride (ONGLYZA, NDC: 0310-6105-90, LOT: MJ0731, EXP: Feb2023) for diabetes, and terbinafine.

Patient says he got the Pfizer vaccine, clarified to Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a couple days ago and the first day he felt bad and had chills and felt wobbly and woozy. He says yesterday (13Jan2021) he felt pretty good, and even worked out. He says he also worked out today, but he has had chills and feels like he has a big weight walking on him, he doesn&#39;t know the right word. He says he is also a diabetic, and he noticed today that his blood sugar has been lower than normal, it is usually normal at 110-120, it is lower today at 96. He says he is careful with his diet and eats the same thing. He says he hasn&#39;t taken his meds today, and he checked his blood sugar again later and it was 153, which is not through the roof, even without his medication so he would like to know does the vaccine affect your blood sugar? He says he got his first dose of the vaccination on Tuesday at 08:00AM, in his left arm. He clarifies that he has had chills today and then feels like there is a big heavy weight on him, he is real tired and his sugar is low, that was odd. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I had violent &amp; severe neck pain and severe headaches. Also an extremely stiff neck where I couldn?t turn it 1/8th oh an inch to either side.  It all got so severe that I didn?t eat for days at a time and was literally not with it.  Couldn?t respond when spoken to, and became excessively weak where I couldn?t walk w/o help, and speech was slurred.  It all lasted 5 days where it was so severe.  With medication it slowly began to back off.

A 60-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER6208) as single dose at the age of 60-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included disability. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced losing strength in his right leg in Mar2021, his leg kept getting worse in 2021, he just can not walk anymore in 2021, leg is swollen in 2021, muscle pain in Mar2021 with, joint pain in Mar2021, muscle spasms in his neck because he has neck pain too in 2021.   The events losing strength in his right leg, his leg kept getting worse, he just can not walk anymore and leg is swollen were assessed medically significant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included magnetic resonance imaging: leg is swollen in 2021, X-ray: nothing showed up in 2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of losing strength in his right leg, muscle pain, joint pain.  The course of events was as follows:  Around 21 Mar2021 or 22Mar2021, he had problems with his leg. Patient was experiencing muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg. Patient stated that was a problem. Patient had an MRI and X-ray that looked to see what the problem was. Patient received second dose on 14Apr2021. Patient hasn&#39;t even seen his prescribing Healthcare Professional yet, until Monday. He hasn&#39;t worked in five years, he&#39;s been on disability. He wanted to get off disability so he went and got a job. He started the job 28Mar2021 and everyday, his leg kept getting worse. He had to leave the job the other day because he just cant walk anymore, he has to do a lot of walking on the job. He called the doctor and told them something was wrong with his leg, they took an x-ray and nothing showed up. They did an MRI and all it shows was that his leg was swollen, no bones or nothing is broken. He was looking at Pfizer paperwork that a facility gave him and the two of symptoms are on there, so this problem was related to the vaccine. He never hurt his right leg, never had a problem until he got this shot. He was losing all his strength in his right leg, all the pain. They have been giving muscle relaxers and ibuprofen and they did not seem to work or be doing anything. First, he went to the emergency room and they gave him Ibuprofen 600 mg tablets and they gave him Cyclobenzaprine 10mg tablets. They said that he was experiencing muscle spasms in his neck because he has neck pain too. So he made an appointment with his family doctor, which there was no openings and had to see another PA. He did not know the HCP last name, but he/she was a PA in the office and he saw him/her, who requested the x-ray, and he had the x-ray done and saw him/her again and nothing showed up so he/she requested an MRI. He went to the hospital to have that and nothing showed up except his leg was swollen. Now they are going to send him to a bone specialist, but there was no reason to because now he stated he knew what was causing this. Patient took Cyclobenzaprine, 10 mg, three times a day by mouth. He states it did not seem to do nothing. Patient verified it was a prescription from the pharmacy:  NDC: 0137517-19674, unsure of LOT, expiry date. The quantity of the first bottle was 15 but he went through that already and he got a new bottle that has 42 in it. This current bottle he has 12 or 13 left. The first bottle was completely gone. Patient took Baclofen 5mg tablets, three times a day: morning, noon, and night. They were not doing anything either, well he did not think they are. Patient provided NDC: 0135391-19674. The first muscle relaxer they gave him, the 10mg one, he took it that day, it knocked him out. Caller states when he saw his doctor, he said he can not take that one while he works, he will take it at night time, so that is why the doctor gave him the other muscle relaxer, Baclofen, to take while he worked during the day. He took one muscle relaxer at night of one kind and the other kind he takes the ones that won&#39;t take him out as much. Patient stated that he had to leave his job because he cannot do it, he cannot walk. Patient took Ibuprofen (NDC: 0139246-19674, to use before 22Apr2022) 600mg, by mouth, three times a day. He took one with the muscle relaxers. Patient took verified all medications Cyclobenzaprine; Baclofen; Ibuprofen were prescriptions from the pharmacy. The outcome of muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg, his leg kept getting worse, was not recovered of he just can not walk anymore on, leg is swollen, neck pain was unknown. Reporter seriousness for muscle pain and joint pain, losing strength in his right leg and neck pain was unspecified Patient received his second dose of Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine (LOT: EW0161, unsure if ER or EW) on 14Apr2021.  A Product Complaint was filed.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                The day after the vaccine, I felt a bit fatigued. Then for 2 days, I felt fine. Then starting on the 3rd day until present, I feel extremely light-headed and unsteady with a persistent severe headache.  Almost feels like there is pressure in my head for lack of a better description. I feel feverish as well but do not have a fever.  I have difficulty maintaining balance on my feet so it is difficult to walk.   I did seek medical attention yet since I live alone and do not feel comfortable to drive. Although the symptoms are difficult, I also don&#39;t consider them an emergency to warrant calling an ambulance.

Went home and still felt dizzy and then I felt like I need to pee  but I was very cold ,  urinated 3 more times thinking it was because it was due to being cold but doctor explained it was due to me drinking lost of water.  Went to bathroom and bassed out and woke up about an hour later, but during the fall I injured the neck by heating your head on the sink, back and broke my nose, when I woke up  I was still very dizzy. Also felt a fast heart rate,  chest pain, very nauseas and started sweating a lot.

A 61-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL9621), intramuscular on the left arm on 22Jan2021 (reported as 07:45 to 08:00) at a SINGLE DOSE for prevent COVID, at 61 years old. Medical history included triple bypass surgery from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime. Symptoms (unspecified which) reported as recurring and are notably worse at bedtime. Patient is hesitant to receive the second dose. The patient stated he just went to sleep and prayed and then when he woke the next day, at night it did it again. At night it comes and goes, and he still has it happen but not like the first time. He tried to describe that he was washing his hands and he almost passed out like on an unspecified date in Jan2021, he was going to lose his mind. Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown. Outcome of the events dizziness, &#34;feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his brain wanted to pop out of his head/ his brain wanted to swell up&#34;, felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy, and fever was reported as recovering.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

I started taking Tylenol but then it stopped working.  it kept kept getting worse and I went to see my Dr. and she put me on some medication, but they did work and she sent me to a Neurologist and he put two medications. They seem to be working, I&#39;m not having them as much. I&#39;m calling tomorrow to see when my appointment is scheduled.

A contactable consumer reported for himself, a 62-year-old male patient who received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (reported as by injection) to left arm on 14Jan2021 at 3pm at single dose to prevent COVID/COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety. Concomitant medications included antidepressants. The patient received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine last 14Jan2021 at 3pm, and everything went well. When he left the place, he had a slight headache. He had to stay there for 15-20 minutes to make sure he had no reaction. He just got a little lightheaded, he didn&#39;t think much, and it didn&#39;t get worse. The patient took 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL) and forgot about it. It went away for a while. He took the shot at 3 pm and he took paracetamol at 4 pm. Later that night, about 10 pm, everything kicked in. He was sick again at 10:30 pm, or so, the headache was gone for several hours. He was ok between 4 pm and 10 pm. Then about 10 to 10:30 pm, when he went to go to sleep, his heart started racing, like he was having a panic attack, then he started getting hot flashes, sweating, chills, and aching, and this went all night from like 10 pm to 11 to the next morning. He had a doctor&#39;s appointment to get his knee examined for an upcoming knee surgery. The patient clarified that he didn&#39;t go to the doctor because of the symptoms, he went for his knee. He asked the doctor, before getting examined, and the doctor said he got off easy, as the doctor himself was sick for 3 days. The patient asked the doctor if he could take something to calm down, as his blood pressure was high on 15Jan2021 at 8 am. They had taken his blood pressure to examine his knee, and the doctor said it was alright. He was prescribed with alprazolam (XANAX), and the doctor said it would be fine. The next day, he was tired from the night before. He had no symptoms the next day. After he took alprazolam, he slept fine, he felt better. The hot flashes, heart racing, body aches, and chills were gone, and he read everything as far as symptoms. The heart racing went away about 11 the next morning because he took alprazolam. The patient stated that he forgot to add one more, he had all the symptoms described as side effects, but he also had itching. He had very mild itching and was given cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC, lot number: OHE2723, expiry date: Feb2022, UPC: 4122053077), it was like 80% gone. Every now and again he has a little itch, but it was bothering him all night that first night. Currently, the patient felt pretty good. He has no symptoms other than the slight itch. He further stated that his second dose is on 04Feb2021. Out of all symptoms, the thing that freaked him out the most was the heart racing, he asked if he could take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) before the shot. He has been on antidepressants for a while, he has a lot of anxiety, but the day he went in, he felt good, and didn&#39;t take alprazolam. He also asked if this have triggered all that heart racing stuff. He was seeking for information if there was anything to do to prepare him better, he knew you have to sit there for 15-20 minutes to see if there was a reaction. The outcome of the event headache and lightheadedness was recovered on 14Jan2021, unknown for blood pressure high and tiredness, recovering for itchy, and recovered on 15Jan2021 at 11 am for all other events.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 25Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing urinary incontinence (use of medication that does not make him run to the bathroom and helps him hold his urine), ongoing acne, drowsy, and ongoing flow of urine or weak bladder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included fesoterodine fumarate (TOVIAZ; Expiration Date: 04Dec2021) (about 2 weeks prior to getting the COVID-19 vaccine) for urinary incontinence, doxycycline (Expiration Date: 26Nov2021; makes him drowsy) for acne, and tamsulosin (Expiration Date: 12Nov2021) for flow of urine or weak bladder; all from Jan2021 and ongoing. The patient does not take any of these medications while driving. The patient took his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 25Jan2021 (Monday). The patient had been experiencing dizziness which started a few days after getting the vaccine (Jan2021). The patient was supposed to work from Tuesday to Friday, but he did not go into work on Wednesday. The patient was unsure of the specific day the dizziness started. The patient did have allergies (unspecified date), but when he called in his doctor, he sent him a medication for allergies, meclizine (Expiration Date: 28Jan2022). Normally, the medication takes a couple days to make him feel better. After he took meclizine for dizziness, he feels better. The patient notices the dizziness when he is up and moving around. The patient can tell something is off, like his equilibrium is off in Jan2021. It may not be due to the shot, but looking at the paper it says tiredness, which he has been feeling fatigued (also started a few days after the vaccine, but he is unsure specifically what day) and dizziness, which he has in Jan2021. The medication he is taking (meclizine), can also do the same thing, but never for this long. When he takes it, it normally makes him feel better after a few days. The patient has sinus problems as well on an unspecified date, but never lasting this long. The patient had not started feeling better since taking the medication, meclizine (as reported). The patient also said that meclizine could be causing the fatigue because it does make his drowsy and he just sleeps when he takes it - he cannot take it when he drives. The patient would go back for the second dose on 15Feb2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Dizziness when he is up and moving around&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Allergies&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

                                                Within 1 minute of vaccine being injected. I started to feel dizzy. I was wheeled in wheelchair to observation area. I kept feeling more dizzy and started to feel tingly in my fingers and legs (both sides equally) After 15 minute observation time was over, I tried to stand up and immediately sat down again as a wave of dizziness  hit me. Doctor in observation area saw me and came over. I told him how I felt. He put his fingers to my wrist and felt my pulse. It was initially between 40 and 90, then steadied off around 90-100. He called for EMTs on duty to come over with a stretcher because he thought I should be laid flat. The EMT took my blood pressure and it was 155/94. The doctor said at one point my pulse was thready. By this point the dizziness was stronger and I felt tingly in my teeth as well as other areas. I was asked about my breathing and I said that it was okay. An ambulance was called for and arrived. I don&#39;t remember the exact time. The moved me from the wheelchair to a stretcher. I could not stand up on my own and lurched toward the stretcher. I am grateful strong people were there to get me on stretcher and strapped in. All throughout this my normally barely noticeable Atrial Fibrillation was quite apparent and more erratic. This was a major reason for ambulance call. Some of the stroke protocol was done including gripping EMT&#39;s fingers equally and following his finger with my eyes. I was very cold throughout. I was brought to the waiting ambulance outside and driven to Medical Center. The EMT took an EKG which showed atrial fibrillation and a line was put into my arm.  When we got to the hospital, I was brought into the triage area and had all my vitals taken. Blood pressure was high, so was pulse then for a half hour, I was very hot and sweated a lot after being cold.

May have cracked rib(s). Currently 2:20 pm on March 14. He is no longer experiencing the dizziness. The rash seems to be clearing up (brownish spots instead of pink spots on trunk). He&#39;s resting.

                                                Change in taste (not loss of) in food, coffee, and alcohol.  Foggy sensation in head.  Increase in metabolism leading to being warm all the time ( no sweating).  Two weeks after second vaccine and while experiencing the above symptoms, I had sudden palpitations with a rapid ventricular response ( 186 beats per minute), severe light headedness, ambulance transport to hospital leading to admission for two days.  This has never happened to me or any family members before.  Discharged from hospital after 2 days in normal rhythm.  Also at this time, taste has returned to normal and foggy feeling has improved.

Woke up  4 AM next day in  total sweat that had to move to other side of bed  Soaked but felt OK   On 23rd  Got headache above right eye to side of frontal lobe,   Not any strong headache at all   Dull  Like a 2 out of 10.  My concern is I still have the exact same headache as I did three weeks ago  Not a smidgen lower at all  SAME.  And I booked second vaccine for Sat 2/27th    I am concerned as I have heard second can be worse.   I have never had the flu and this was my first ever vaccine of any kind    Please advise

                                                At about 5 PM on March 20th, 2021, I felt so dizzy that it was almost impossible to walk.  I had to hold onto furniture as I made my way across the room.  After this continued for several hours, I did some research on the web and was led to believe that being dizzy was a serious event.  At 7:11 PM, I got a ride to the hospital and checked into the emergency room.  I was there at the hospital for about 30 minutes and noticed that the dizzy feeling was gone.  I walked out of the hospital without every going back to an examination room.  I caught a ride home at 8:08 PM.  Note that the only other adverse event was a sore arm and a vague feeling of not being well.

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: Not Reported), via an unspecified route of administration on Arm Right on 18Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included spinal injury, an infection in his scrotum, some neurogenic things, white blood cells (his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine). There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that, the consumer stated, &#34;my wife and me went to hospital and we got a COVID vaccine first one, we had some, my wife had terrible side effects, I am crippled, and I had not it before in Mar2021, she is ok, but she is just sick, I am sick, but she is very sick and she got bad stuffs (rash).&#34; Caller states that both him and his wife were having some side effects, although his wife was having the worse trouble. Caller states that last night, him and his wife were up all night. Caller was up because his wife was up so sick. Caller states that both him and his wife are sick and disabled, that is why they got the shot. Caller reports that he is retired and disabled because he got hurt at work. Caller states that what he is experiencing, is he just feels bad on 18Mar2021. Caller states that he did previously go to a doctor to do a blood study, the doctor is looking for blood diseases or cancer in the caller, and caller thinks that taking the COVID shot just exposed his weak spots. Caller reports that both him and his wife have body aches. Caller was wondering if there was anything, he can go get over the counter at the pharmacy to help. Caller reports that he cannot call his doctor, because they are all out on Fridays. Caller states that him and his wife are not planning to take the second dose of the product. Caller states that they have a lot of hurricanes where they live. Their house got tore up in one, and they sold it to one of their sons, and the caller and his wife moved out to their beach house for a while. He had an infection in his scrotum, something stung him, and that is what the doctors are looking for in him now, because his white blood cell count is high, and he has a rash on his scrotum in Mar2021. It was infected. Caller states that this infection in his scrotum has flared back up since getting the COVID vaccine yesterday, so caller had thought it went away but he guesses it never went away. Caller confirms that the issues with his white blood cells and scrotum started prior to him getting the vaccine, but the caller thinks that the vaccine was exposing the caller&#39;s weak spots, and maybe that is a god send because it is all flared up now, and the caller will be able to tell his doctor that. Caller states that he has been getting high white blood cell count readings since the stuff with his scrotum first started, and that is why his doctor sent him to an Oncologist for all this blood testing, so maybe this will be a b lessing in disguise for the caller, in finding out what is wrong with him. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

But the right one had complete hearing loss. Thinking it would be a short term side effect, but realizing on Thursday am with was not, I called my physician office on Thursday and they called back on Thursday for a Friday 9am appt with the PA. She said it was sinus related , fluid in the ears was pushing the ear drum back and gave me a prescription for Fluticasone and to take my Zyretx and Sudafed. Call her in a week if symptoms did not away. On 4/12/21, I still have massive hearing loss and pain, so called a ENT for an appt and received a 1:15pm on the same day. This  was the first day I had balance issues.

                                                Excruciating right glenohumeral (shoulder) joint pain -- no muscle pain, along with greatly restricted range of motion.  It is apparent that the hypodermic needle punctured the rotator cuff and bottomed out onto bone (&#34;twinge&#34; felt upon point of full insertion and upon injection).  The injection site was too high on the upper arm (just below the subacromial space - I have photos with the location marked).  Additionally, the 1-1/2 inch long hypodermic needle was fully inserted without manipulating the muscle to raise its height.  The above was confirmed by examination by Doctor.         Pain and diminished range of motion still evident, but somewhat subsiding as of 11:00PM 2-15-2021 (55 hours after onset).

This is the first of two reports. A 64-year-old male patient receive first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), at same age intramuscular in arm left on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee, a knot on the left side of his head, bleeding from above his left eyebrow, had a left black eye, all on Nov2020, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cataract surgery, using crutches when he walks, in the hospital from Nov2020 to 17Nov2020, pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital on Nov2020, he couldn&#39;t walk on 19Nov2020, 6 stents, 3 cardiac stents on Oct2020, and chicken pox as a young adult. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before. He said he had chicken pox as a young adult, and he only had 1 spot of chicken pox. He had never had dry eyes before. Reporter seriousness for fever, UTI, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness, rash, shingles were medically significant. For other events were unspecified. The outcome of event injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness was recovered on 31Jan2021, dry eye, tiredness was not recovered, while the outcomes of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known possible local reaction, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of injection site pain, redness, and puffiness cannot be excluded. The other events are considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to the use of BNT162B2.

I went to local doctor and he prescribed additional BP meds. BP now good (126/80) but I still experience dizziness from time to time. Yesterday when BP high I also had constant headache and some nausea. Today(3/12), almost week after shot I still experience dizziness to a minor degree off and on, but still somewhat severe when lying down, looking up, and bending over

                                                I had no adverse effects at the time of the vaccination and the day was uneventful but I got a small headache early in the evening on the left side of my head/neck.  I ignored it.  By bedtime 10/11 PM Thursday night I had pain in my neck on the right side that felt like I had been in a bad car accident.  By 4 O&#39;clock in he morning the pain was almost unbearable.  I got up and did an hour of stretching and it became bearable.  I had finally taken a  8 MG HYDROMORPHONE tablet just before 4 AM that the doctor had given me last summer for falling over a pile of lumber and landing on my back on a 4 x 4 board.  That helped some.    Ever since then, the pain in my neck has gone from a 4/10 to a 9/10 in pain and the headaches have clustered on the left side of my head.  The worst ones are just below my left ear.   It is now Saturday night and the neck pain is not as bad but it is not gone either,  It still hurts to turn my head, cough or when I get up or down.  I did not do anything physically to cause this.

One day after receiving the vaccination I took a walk with some hills and had what I believe was a mild episode of atrial fibrillation. I verified as best I could, using a pulse oximeter.  I feel fine for the most part, but a little bit tired and dizzy. I do not plan to call the doctor unless things get worse.

He could answer questions from the nurses but would respond really slowly. He received the shot on his right arm then he went to stand in the nurse window. Around 10 minutes later, we heard a thud and glass fall down and saw that he had fallen on the floor. His eyes were open and he was responsive. He had the same slow demeaner. He said that his legs felt weak so he fell. The paramedics were called and the staff nurse told them that he had fallen about 10 days ago. He had no issues with his first Covid dose. The paramedics took him to the nearest hospital.

Around 8:15 / 8:20am I began feeling very dizzy and unable to stand up on my own. I couldn&#39;t walk down the hallway without holding onto the wall. This went on all day, long after the effects of the Bayer Back &amp; Body would have worn off . Even at dinner time I was uneasy / unstable walking around. The only time I felt well was when I was lying in bed. By the next morning, Wednesday the 24th, I wasn&#39;t 100% that morning either but I went to work and did the work. It was very difficult but by afternoon I was feeling much better. It wasn&#39;t until Thursday that I was feeling 100%. I had never felt this way in my life. No it was not Epilepsy related and I had been taking Bayer Back &amp; Body FOR YEARS without problem except maybe taking two, occasionally would feel the caffeine.

                                                Patient received his first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 3/3/21. Patient was conscious with no apparent issues after administration. Patient was asked to sit down for 15-minute observation afterwards. A few minutes later patient was swaying back and forth in his chair and saying he was feeling faint. I repeatedly addressed patient by his first name and asked if he could hear me and repeatedly asked if he was okay. Patient began slumping down in his chair but was still conscious. Patient was not responsive but made eye contact with me. Patient requested water. After giving patient water and observing him drink he began looking nauseous and threw up. Patient then passed out in his chair. I supported the patient upright in his chair and made sure he did not fall down or injure his head. I then immediately tapped him on both shoulders and repeatedly called his name. Patient then became responsive and 911 was called. While waiting patient said he was starting to feel better and was able to support himself in his chair. I did not observe any injuries due to fainting. When the ambulance came patient agreed to be taken to the hospital.

Medical history included Covid-19: he tested positive for COVID and received the monoclonal antibody, bamlanivimab on 13Dec2020; other unspecified health conditions which might make him high risk. The patient previously received monoclonal antibody 17-1a, bamlanivimab on 13Dec2020. For Covid-19. The patient received other unspecified medications in two weeks. On 28Dec2020 21:00, 3 hours after vaccination, he was feeling bad with flu-like symptoms, nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue and diarrhea. No treatment received. Covid was not tested post vaccination. The outcome of events was not recovered.  His colleague now knows he should have waited 90 days after the antibody but reporter was wondering if there was information. Since there probably is no information, this is a unique situation and reporter wondered if Pfizer wants him to run any particular tests or send in some blood to Pfizer for testing to further medical knowledge on giving the vaccine within 90 days of the antibodies.

Patient stated they were also having breathing difficulties. Immediately tested patients bloods pressure. Tested twice and came to 220/120 with heart rate 80. Was an emergent situation. Informed patient I was contacting 911 to have them take him to the hospital as this is an emergency situation. Went and made phone call. Had staff bring patient into waiting area so that we could monitor him if something worsened. 911 advised to just monitor the patient. If he began vomiting or passed out to have him on his side, so he doesn&#39;t choke from vomit. We monitored patient until ambulance arrived. They asked for current medications we knew of (listed in report) and that he had received Pfizer Covid vaccine 0.3ml resulting in emergency BP readings of 220/120 after receiving.  Ambulance took patient to Hospital. Current condition unknown or if anything even occurred after that point. Whole event lasted about 1 hour before patient left with medical personnel.

                                                Immediately after pt received vaccine he told his wife (driver) that he was feeling dizzy. Wife then stopped vehicle in Lane #6 halfway down to observation and called for help from observation staff. Upon arrival of observation staff pt was found to be unresponsive but still had a pulse and was breathing on his own. Pt was in the passenger set. Observation staff alerted onsite medical professionals and MD and the crash cart was brought to the car. Vitals were taken. Within a minute pt became responsive and opened his eyes and began to communicate with healthcare staff. O2 sat was noted to be low so O2 was applied at 6L/min via facemask. Onsite Batallion Chief stated he had already called EMS and they were en route. MD remained at the vehicle with pt and continued to monitor until EMS arrived and assumed care. EMS  did an EKG and pt found to have sinus brady, with a pulse in the 50&#39;s. EMS decided to transport pt to hospital for further evaluation. Pt transported to ambulance via stretcher in stable condition, alert.

                                                My wife &amp; I are unsure if what we both are experiencing is just coincidental or actually the cause as a result of the 2nd dose shots we both received but we are both experiencing similar events approximately a week&#43; after the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Her information is as follows: Pt age 64, same address &amp; contact information as listed for myself, 1st Pfizer dose 2/6/21 EL9264, 2nd dose 3/1/21 EN6202. We had no immediate event after both shots except for soreness in upper arms at injection sight and this ceased after approximately a day. But as mentioned at a week&#43; of 2nd dose we both started having a severe aching pain. Her pain is in her right knee. My aching pain is in my right hip down my leg to my knee &amp; chin/calf area. It was very difficult to put weight on the leg to walk. We have been icing the areas and taking pain over the counter medication Aleve which has helped somewhat but we are still experiencing as of the date of this submission.  It seems strange we both are experiencing similar issue at approximately the same time.  Coincidence?  Due to reaction to the vaccine?  We are submitting this report to see if it might be and if others have experienced this issue. We are unaware of any physical activity  we may have done during this time to have caused this pain to start occurring. Thank you for any response.

Next day pain was increased and range of motion declined. By Friday, March 12th I could not raise arm more than 6 inches. Went to the Dr. on 3/12/21 and was referred to the Orthopaedics. Saw PA on 3/12/21. Xrays were taken I believe the diagnosis is in part subacromial bursitis.. Received Cortisone shot. Range of motion was much improved and has stayed about the same through today. Iced shoulder last night because of mild pain. Woke up in considerable pain which has continued today. I have iced the shoulder and upper arm at other times also since 3/10/21.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

Thursday the pain lessened and the weakness became less but I started getting pain in my hips and  heavy painful bloating feeling in my intestinal area. That lasted all day and into Friday (today). Today (Friday) the pain in my arms subsided, legs got  better (no pain but still weak) but the intestinal issues are keeping me incapacitated and the top of my hips ache.

I bent over trying to catch my breath with my hands on my knees.My wife who is a nurse said that&#39;snot normal and we need to go to the hospital. While driving there I felt a tingling in my entire body and thought I was going to pass out. We got to the hospital and they hooked me up to a monitor.  My heart beats were super low and jumping all over the place throwing PVC&#39;s. It showed my rate going down to 28 beats and then back up to 60 and down again.It was all over the board.

                                                No side effects until  abruptly at 30 hours after the dose I had the most severe episode of very loud tinnitus and vertigo. Resolved after 150 minutes.  Interestingly, 8 days after the first dose (lot number EL 3247) had a similar but slightly milder reaction that lasted 24 hours. I do have Meniere?s with intermittent episodes like this for many years, but these two events were profoundly more severe than any in the past.

A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9266 (it looked like 9266 or 9244)) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included stroke, balance was always off because of stroke, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, depression, diabetic (has diabetes), liver, enlarged heart, and cholesterol. Concomitant medication(s) included warfarin for an unspecified indication; entecavir for liver; metoprolol for high blood pressure and congestive heart failure; losartan for stroke and enlarged heart; bupropion for depression; glipizide for diabetes; metformin for diabetes; diltiazem hydrochloride (DILT-XR) for blood pressure and reduces stroke; atorvastatin for cholesterol. The patient had his second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 and wanted to know these side effects. He had a sore arm on Feb2021 that was fine and went away on 2021. The following Sunday on 21Feb2021, he had really low blood sugar (40). He never had it this low (blood sugar never got that low like 40). He had to call emergency and went into emergency. He also had to call reported the week afterwards on 2021, his blood sugar was still low. In the following week, his blood sugar still stayed relatively low, not as low as when he went into emergency but it was still low between 50 and 70 in 2021 (also reported that the blood sugar was low the following week, the whole week, his blood sugar was still low, lower than it normally was). After that week, he started getting out of nowhere he just turn around and head started spinning on Mar2021, he was dizzy on 04Mar2021 and he lost his balance (couldn&#39;t tell because his balance was always off because he had stroke so he couldn&#39;t tell if it&#39;s from prior stroke or the vaccine) like he kept falling down and every time he got up he kept falling down (fell down multiple times) on Mar2021 (also reported that then after the week that&#39;s when he started getting really dizzy and falling down)- that just kept happening. He also had a couple of incidents of vertigo but, he usually fall down and got up and it usually go away but this one he kept falling down. He made it to his bed and he was going to call, but he was just resting. After that (now), he had been having off and on headaches on Mar2021. He wanted to know if anyone else has reported this and how long would this last. He talked to 3 of his doctors and these side effects of the vaccination. After the question they said, they really couldn&#39;t tell, as it can be understood that it could be a mixture of his health conditions and all his medications that he takes, cause these things happened he was just trying to find out if there was any different test, what caused his blood sugar go down. They stopped his medication that had brought back up. The falling down and headaches, they were not sure, so he was calling. Other people had called them up, the doctors really couldn&#39;t tell. They didn&#39;t really know. He didn&#39;t blame them. It was hard to tell, everybody was different, so he was just trying calling to find out. He was still experiencing headache on and off and dizziness. The HCP took him off his diabetic medications. He hadn&#39;t taken anything for the headache. He did take a couple of pills for the dizziness when he fell down because might thought it was of vertigo, so they gave him this medication- already taken 2 of them which was meclizine 25mg and took it twice. He had a CAT SCAN (CSCAN) on 09Mar2021 and MRI on 14Mar2021, both with unknown results. The outcome of the event &#39;sore arm&#39; was recovered in 2021 as it already went away; &#39;low blood sugar (40)&#39;, &#39;dizzy&#39;, &#39;headache off and on&#39;, &#39;lost his balance&#39; was not recovered; of the rest of events was unknown.

Only to discover that it was possible that the injection was not administered properly  could have been a SIRVA situation.  Since that time I&#39;ve been to three different doctors, x-rays, MRI, and a cortisone injection. I have currently limited range of motion and I&#39;m hoping that with physical therapy my rotator cuffs and the area of my shoulder will come back to normal. This so far has cost me in copays and my business of teaching children dance and outdoor activities is now gone.

                                                Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness; Almost passed out; Very light headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm (shoulder), on 26Jan2021 at 12:00, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, acid reflux, and multivitamin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, esomeprazole for acid reflux, and ascorbic acid/ biotin/ boron/ calcium/ calcium pantothenate/ chloride/ chromium/ colecalciferol/ copper/ cyanocobalamin/ folic acid/ iodine/ lycopene/ magnesium/ manganese/ molybdenum/ nickel/ nicotinamide/ phosphorus/ phytomenadione/ potassium/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol acetate/ riboflavin/ selenium/ silicon dioxide/ sodium metavanadate/ thiamine mononitrate/ tocopheryl acetate/ xantofyl/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER ADULTS 50&#43;) as multivitamin, all were ongoing; omeprazole for acid reflux; and an unspecified multivitamin.  The patient really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. The patient has been administered both first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. The patient had been having some strange things that he didn&#39;t know if its COVID-19 shot related but they&#39;re symptoms he never had before. About 8 to 11 days after first dose of the vaccine (Feb2021; maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021), the patient had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out or almost fainted. The patient clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8 to 11 days. Also, in Feb2021, the patient had almost a very light headache where he almost fainted. The patient went to the emergency room in Feb2021 and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00 to 18:00 the following day. The patient spent the night in hospital, they sent him the next day. While in hospital (Feb2021), the patient had electrocardiograms (EKGs) of his head (as reported), magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of his head, computed tomography (CTs; CT scan with contrast) of his head, and echocardiograms of his heart (microcardiogram). All of those tests came back normal (okay), nothing abnormal on results. They were relating this to a stroke-like symptom; however, the results were normal, also his blood test results were fine. The patient had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3 to 4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. The patient was not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because the event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit. Because of the first episode, the patient then went to his family doctor and the doctor ordered some other testing done. The patient was scheduled to get a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test (stress test of heart), his results on 10Mar2021 came back normal (not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine). The patient believed that the results of those tests both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. The patient was continuing to have some lightheaded episodes or symptoms just about daily but nothing really; continued to have symptoms which was not normal for him. Sometimes, they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes, the patient had a good day, but he had those lightheaded episodes and he never had it before he got the shot. As therapeutic measures in the hospital, the emergency room gave the patient something for dizziness when he was there, but he was no longer taking it. Currently, the patient was really taking nothing. The patient had also gone to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor where he had a balance test or a videonystagmography (VNG) test done on 17Mar2021. The patient will get results of balance test on Wednesday (24Mar2021). Every year (unspecified), the patient goes and get his yearly test in which they had his blood work done and this and his glucose levels were always good, cholesterol level was always good. All the patient&#39;s other tests come back as normal on an unspecified date. The patient had never had these symptoms before, he hasn&#39;t changed his medications or habits and it&#39;s odd that this happened 9 to 10 days after both doses of the vaccine. The patient would like to know if this has been reported before as a side effect related to the vaccine. The patient was not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. Also, he does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can&#39;t figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines. So the patient doesn&#39;t know if anybody else is reporting this but he had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them around days after each shot and he was continuing to have lightheaded episodes but not severe as those 2 but he had lightheaded (dizzy) episodes daily, since the COVID-19 vaccine. But they didn&#39;t know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the COVID-19 shot. And he never had anything like that, and he was not blaming it on the COVID-10 shot. That was the only thing changed in his lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that&#39;s the only thing changed, his medication has not changed, and diet doesn&#39;t change. Nothing has changed other than the patient got COVID-19 shots. The patient wanted to report it, so the company had a report file and other people reporting it. The patient wanted to know if the company was having any other report or something like this so that he would know if it might be related to the shot. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Pt said he felt kind of weak after the vaccine shot on Sunday but can still walk to bed. Waking up on Monday, he could not walk. He could not sit up due to hip muscle weakness. Later on Monday, he developed a fever with a T-max of 101.6 °F.  MRI C/T/L spine demonstrated cauda equine nerve root enhancement, lumbar puncture w/ protein 58 and lymphocytic pleocytosis (atypical for GBS), patient was started on IVIg (had infusion reaction) and switched to PLEX (s/p 3 sessions) with clinical improvement. At time of discharge, was able to walk with a walker.

                                                found down unconscious; unwitnessed fall; oxygen was in the 60s; submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli; right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein; some degree of right heart dysfunction; blood sugar very high; A1C elevated; Haptoglobin elevated; elevated troponin; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 67-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot number was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, at the age of 67-year-old, on 25Feb2021, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Traumatic brain injury at the age of 29 which resulted in a CVA (right sided stroke)because the hospital did not know how to give Mannitol, behavioral problems in 2008, run over by a train in 2008, wears two AFOs (one on the left leg from having a right sided stroke, he also wears one on his left leg from having a stroke with right sided weakness, the right AFO was worn since he was 29, and then the other one he started wearing in 2008 when he was run over by a train and almost had his leg severed and he wears a left AFO), dementia diagnosed 4-5 years ago, head surgeries, depression, affective disorder, anxiety. The patient had multiple hospitalizations, and he has hyper reflexivity like all brain patients have. The patient has no history of blood clots or emboli. Concomitant medications included olanzapine (ZYPREXA) taken for depression and oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) taken for affective disorder and anxiety.  The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number not reported) single dose for covid-19 immunisation, pneumonia and flu vaccine in 2008 for immunization and has no reaction. The patient received his second dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021 and two weeks later he was found down/ was found down unconscious at the nursing home and his oxygen was in the 60&#39;s on 15Mar2021. The nursing home did not know if her brother hit his head because it was unwitnessed. The patient was found down, not responsive, and it was an unwitnessed fall. The patient was treated as a trauma patient and that this occurred around 10 oclock on 15Mar2021. At that time, he was transferred to a local hospital to the emergency room and put on oxygen. They transferred him within 4 hours because they did not know what to do. Caller adds that the hospital thought that he had a subdural hematoma but the hospital does not have a neuro radiologist, so the hospital transferred to the other hospital that somebody with head knowledge can look at his CAT scan. The patient was misdiagnosed with a subdural hematoma because there were changes in his CT scan from his 3 previous brain surgeries. The patient had a traumatic brain injury when he was 29, and experienced changes.  The patient was found to have submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli on 15Mar2021 described as central lobar sub segmental PEs in both lungs, PE was within the distal right main artery, pulmonary artery distal left main, left middle lobe, middle right lobe / upper right lower lobe and middle lobar, segmental and sub segmental pulmonary arteries. The patient also had pulmonary emboli in the distal left main pulmonary artery of left middle lobe and left lower lobe, pulmonary arteries. There was also some degree of right heart dysfunction which was diagnosed by contrast. On 15Mar2021, the patient also had right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein. The patient is in a nursing home, the doctor did not want to listen to the reporter because her brother is a nursing home patient and they just assume he is immobile but he is not.  The patient underwent lab test and procedures which included Blood sugar very high (they think it was because of heart strain and acute injury because then it came down down down), A1C elevated, Haptoglobin elevated, elevated troponin. These results were all elevated and from acute injury. At the time of the report, the patient is feeling better and needs less oxygen. The events found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism, right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein, and some degree of right heart dysfunction caused hospitalization from 15Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The reporter absolutely does believe the events and the suspect drug are correlated. Outcome of found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism was recovered on 18Mar2021 while it was unknown for the other events.

Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 23Jan2021 12:30, he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient states he felt fine at the clinic after 15 mins and then after he left he felt lightheaded and dizzy and this continued on. Patient says his reaction was about 20 plus minutes after his injection, which he was fine when he got the injection, he became lightheaded and that has kind of continued on. He says it was pretty bad on the first day, then the second day it went away. He says a couple days later it came back, with his heart kind of racing, and he was still experiencing that though it was getting better. This was not something he had be-fore and he feels anxious and body is tight with dizziness. He says he experiences it periodically, and today it was not bad, but yesterday it came back again. He says he was concerned about that, but he hasn&#39;t passed out or anything. He says he went to the doctor and had an EKG and blood work done, which were all ok. He says it has been off and on, and he was kind of very anxious and tense as well, his insides are tight and jittery, sort of. He says he didn&#39;t see that listed as a common side effect. He says he had soreness at injection site, that went away, and he had no fever or any-thing, just the lightheadedness. He says he wants to see about the lightheadedness, if it had been reported by others, since he didn&#39;t notice it as a common reaction, to see what is going on there, since it has been over a week and it hasn&#39;t totally gone away, so he is concerned about having his second dose. Am doing better now. Went to the doctor for tests on 27Jan2021 (Wednesday). Test results were okay. Patient states these are not some of the common side effects he has seen or read about. He would like to know when will his symptoms go away. Patient would like to know if he should receive the second dose that was scheduled in less than two weeks. Patient states he called his doctor had an EKG and blood work done and his tests were negative. The outcome for soreness at injection site was recovered on an unspecified date and for rest events was recovering.

About 8-11 days after first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine he had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out. About 8-11 days after second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine he had a very lightheaded episode that was much more vertigo-like where things were spinning. He clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8-11 days.  Consumer is not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. He does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can&#39;t figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines.   Patient: Age at onset: Over the age of 65 years. Reporter: Address: Unknown. Primary: Further address details/Email: Unknown. Very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out: Onset about 8-11 days after first dose was administered, maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021. He went to the emergency room on the date of event onset and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00-18:00 the following day. While in hospital he had EKGs of his head-verified this information with caller repeatedly; MRIs of his head; CTs of his head; and echocardiograms of his heart. All of those tests came back ok, nothing abnormal on results. They recommended he have a stress test done which was not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Very lightheaded episode that was much more vertigo-like where things were spinning: Onset was about 8-11 days after second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. He has never had vertigo in his life before event. He went back to the emergency room on date of onset of this event, but was not admitted to the hospital at that time; was only in the emergency room about 5-6 hours. While in the emergency room he had CT scans of his head, MRIs of his head and EKGs and everything looks good, nothing abnormal on results. Outcome: He still has ongoing very lightheaded episodes for a good part of the day. Those episodes usually last about 30 minutes and occur multiple times daily but are not really severe like the 2 initial events were following the first dose and then the second dose. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: First dose: 26Jan2021 Lot: EL9263 NDC/Expiry: Unknown, this is not on CDC vaccine record card. Dose: Unknown strength/volume/dose injection to left arm shoulder before 12:00 Second dose: 15Feb2021 Lot: EL9267 NDC/Expiry: Unknown, this is not on CDC vaccine record card. Dose: Unknown strength/volume/dose injection to left arm shoulder before 12:00 - verified with reporter that details were same for both first and second doses. This completed his prescribed therapy. Regarding concomitant products and other medical conditions caller reported he really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. Regarding other testing/investigations done relative to these events:  He had a nuclear stress test and exercise stress test, both performed on 10Mar2021 he believes and results of those tests were they both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. He has gone to the ENT-ear, nose and throat doctor where he had a balance test done which he referred to also as a VNG test-Videonystagmography done on 17Mar2021. He will get results of balance test on Wednesday, 24Mar2021.  He had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3-4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. He is not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit.

It&#39;s # (Hence follow-up was checked). Well I have been having some strange things that I don&#39;t know if its Covid shot related but it&#39;s symptom like I never had before. After I had received the first shot, I had almost a very light headache where I almost fainted. We went to ER, they were sort of testing, it might be stroke like symptom and they did a MRI of my brain and they did CT scan of my brain and CT scan contrast. They did micro cardiogram, some EKGs and work. All of those come back normal. So I spent the night in hospital, they sent me the next day. I continued to have some light headed symptoms but nothing real bad but continued to have symptoms which was not normal for me. After I had my shot about 10 days after the second shot, I had another episode. This was much more vertigo like or the room is spinning and the walk and things are moving. I did go back to ER again just in case there was something going on. They tested again another CT scan and EKG and everything looked normal and they said it sounded like a vertigo related. I told him I had shot about 10 days after each shot, the symptoms hit me. Because of the first episode my family doctor ordered some other testing done, and they did stress test of my heart, a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test of my heart and both came back normal. But I am continuing to have the light headed, the episodes just about daily. Sometimes they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes I have a good day but I have those light headed episodes and I never had it before I got the shot. I am also going ENT- ear, nose and throat doctor to check on vertigo stuff and they did some testing last week and I am supposed to get the result tomorrow on what they found about vertigo test but I never had vertigo or light headed or anything before the shot. So I don&#39;t know if anybody else is reporting this but I had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them 10ish days after each shot and I am continuing to have light headed episodes but not severe as those 2 but I had light headed dizzy episodes daily, since the Covid vaccine. I want to report it, so you guys have a report file and other people reporting it. I guess I sort of want to know if you guys were having any other report or something like this. So that I know it might be related to the shot. I am still working with my ENT and I tried to figure out if it&#39;s vertigo. If it&#39;s not vertigo then they have really run all sorts of test and if it&#39;s not vertigo we don&#39;t know if Covid shot triggered the vertigo or not. Let me know, we don&#39;t know. So they have ran 30,000 dollar test on me and so far all my tests are coming back normal.&#34; Consumer was informed about the role of Pfizer Drug Safety and Pfizer Medical Information.

I don&#39;t know what test they are going to show, if they do show vertigo there will be some treatments to help me. But we don&#39;t know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the Covid shot. And I never had anything like that and I am not blaming it on the Covid shot. That was the only thing changed in my lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that&#39;s the only thing changed, my medication has not changed, diet doesn&#39;t changed.

He then stated that the calf on his other leg &#34;got messed up&#34; and was found to have a blood clot as well as fluid on that knee. He reported that it was as stiff as a board and that he could not walk on either of his knees for a couple of days. He reported that he still has problems with the one knee that &#34;blew up&#34; and had to be drained but stated that the inflammation in the calf where blood clot was has receded and is back to normal. He stated that he had to visit the emergency room twice and see an orthopedic surgeon for these issues and has been prescribed Xarelto to take to treat the blood clot. In the morning his leg was stiff. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated on 16Apr2021, blood clot on right leg on 12Apr2021, and pain in groin on 13Apr2021. The pain in his groin went down, but his calf swelled to twice the size and it felt like a horse because he was favoring it. It felt like a muscle cramp. The orthopedic saw him for his left knee and he was seen in the Emergency Room for his right and they called his primary doctor. He tried to work and paid the price with his left knee. He has been taking Tylenol and icing it. The last two days (unspecified date) he has been babying it, the weather has been not so great, so he is laying low and give it a rest, but knows he is supposed to get up and move around so he has been doing that and elevating it. He would like to know if, based on these symptoms he experienced after the vaccine, he should get the second dose of the vaccine, which he states he is supposed to get on Tuesday. The outcome of the events &#34;Right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated&#34;, and &#34;Pain in groin&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

Observed by attending physician while resting reclined with head elevated. Provided hydration (water). Elevated blood pressure began to decline within 30 minutes thereafter. Was able to drive home. Have since been suffering with mild to moderate sinus headaches and stiffness in the joints of my hands/fingers on both left and right hands. Ears occasionally clogged. Taking Tylenol and Flonase.

                                                Shot administered Wednesday morning. Sore arm, but not particularly bad. Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

                                                Three days post-vaccine, I began to experience chest pressure and slight pain in my chest--directly under each of my armpits. After 3 hours I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and they suggested I call 911 and go to the Emergency Department to be sure I was not having a heart attack. Multiple EKGs, a chest xray, and blood tests revealed that my heart was in good shape. I have continued  to have very slight pressure in that area, but it is occasional and is almost gone. Even after 5 days since the vaccination, I am experiencing side effects although they have reduced in severity. Fatigue, occasional slight dizziness, occasional shortness of breath, occasional slight pain in various parts of my body.

Over the following six days, symptomes frogresses to extreme skin sensitivity and diffuse aching of chest cage and muscles, back, associated with fatigue and stiffness of joints especially after being at rest and trying to move. By the 6th day after onset of symptoms, an erythematous eruption developed along the left T7 dermatome, becoming more pronounced on the 7th day, but not the true vesicular rash we usually see in zoster dermatitis. Discomfort is relieved by taking excedrin and tylenol. I did not try NSAIDs due to gastritis reaction. No fever or chills, sore throat, cough, etc. I started Valtrex today  to be taken tid.

                                                Loss of balance. This happened when I woke up the morning after receiving the vaccine. For the first hour or two, I could only stand up or walk if I held onto the wall, a railing, or furniture. It gradually went away through the day. Late in that day, and to a lesser extent over the next two days, I occasionally experienced a slight sensation of loss of balance, but I never needed to hold onto anything. I never fell, even during the initial onset. However, I definitely would have fallen during the initial hour or two if I hadn&#39;t held onto things. I have never had problems with balance in the past.  I noticed that the loss of balance happened more when I moved quickly (sitting up quickly, turning left or right quickly, rolling over, etc.)

On the 08Jan2021 at about 8PM he had a massive stroke and they had to life flight him to hospital from 08Jan2021 to 19Jan2021. He did have a blockage in his carotid artery but they have been told. She says her husband just had his second vaccine with lot is EL1283 and exp is Apr2021 and all of this could be a coincidence but he told her to call so that was why she was calling. Also he was diagnosed with, it is 4 words and then leukemia and he had an appointment with doctor to get his blood drawn every 2 weeks. The neurosurgeon that did surgery on him on 09Jan2021 at 4 am said that his carotid artery in his neck was plugged and he went in and cleaned it out and put in a stent and he said that his carotid artery was plugged all the way to his temple and he tried to get that out and couldn&#39;t. He had his stroke at 8PM on the 08Jan2021. They had dinner at 5 pm and at 6pm they were sitting on the couch and all of sudden he started slurring his words and he said his mouth felt like someone give him Novocain and then he had his arm around her and all of sudden it felt like he was choking her so she grabbed his hand and his fingers started rolling up, started closing up tight so she started playing with his fingers and then he went out in the kitchen and then he hit the floor and she called # and the paramedics came up there. When they got there he could squeeze both hands and lift both feet by that time it was 7:30, they had just brought in a chair, by time they got done bringing in the chair they realized his left side was becoming paralyzed and so they had to go back and get the stretcher so they were there for about 30 minutes, maybe 15 minutes then they headed up the hill toward the hospital at about 8pm and they came in and gave anti-blood clotting medicine and took him for a scan with dye, they found he still had a blockage on his brain so at 2AM on the 9th they came in with a medical helicopter and flew him to (institution name withheld) in (place name withheld) and they did an MRI on and seen his carotid blockage there so he had emergency surgery at from # that morning of the 09Jan2021 at (institution name withheld) and he was in ICU from Saturday until a week ago at 3 oclock 13Jan2021 he was placed in a regular room and on the 19Jan2021 at 7:30PM he was moved (hospital name) in (place name withheld) for 14 days having 15 hours per day of therapy for a week and then he will go to (place name withheld) (rehab name withheld) and he could be there 2-3 weeks.

He was extremely dizzy and not completely coherent. I took him to the hospital where they ran CAT scans and labeled it a TIA.

                                                Within an hour of receiving 2nd dose started experiencing headaches and dizziness. In addition to the headaches and severe dizziness I started having significant bouts with diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite and have not slept well.  Within a couple days I noticed pronounced tremors in my right hand and I started losing weight from 180 pounds to 157, around 23 pound loss.  I contacted my physician and was alerted to make this report and have an appointment on March 1.

                                                After about 3 hours (around noon) I began to feel like I was coming down with a cold and fever. By 4PM I had chills and body aches. By 8 pm I took my temperature and it was a low grade 99.8. Through the remainder of the night the chills worsened to the point where I was shaking uncontrollably and I could not get warm. I was also very dizzy. The next day (2/26/21) was more of the same along with a very painful headache and muscle aches especially in my shoulders and neck. That night all of those symptoms continued along with very sharp stabbing pains in my left leg above the knee cap. The dizziness also continued and I nearly passed out trying to get out of bed early in the morning. My fever had increased to 100.5 at the highest. I was also very weak by the end of the day on 2/26/21. On 2/27/21 I was beginning to feel a bit better but still had that low grade fever (now about 99.8) a headache and I remained very weak. The weakness was especially evident in my legs - it was very hard to stand up. It is now 2/28/21 and I am feeling nearly 100% myself again.   From all I had read and understood I was expecting to have a reaction to the 2nd vaccine. I did not consider any of this life threatening nor necessary to call my PCP. Still, I wanted to report these reactions as it is my understanding the adverse reactions to the 2nd vaccination are common in people much younger than me.

The next day I had chills and my fever went up to 101, I took about 6 Tylenol and 6 Advil to bring the fever down. The following day I was feeling better. The yesterday I woke up with a weird feeling on the left side of my lower lip, it is like numbness, like just it feels weird.  I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow.

                                                Slight headache about 30 minutes after receiving shot at 11 AM, Saturday, 3/6/2021. About 5 hours after shot I started feeling like I was coming down with something, like I had a mild fever and headache was a little more pronounced, but still mild. By 8pm I had fever of 102F, headache was now uncomfortable, so took 2 Tylenol and went to bed. Fever broke about 3-4AM, but still retained a very mild fever of 99F with very mild headache,  muscle aches and joint stiffness/pain for the following day and the day after. By Tuesday 3/9, head was starting to clear and feeling like I had mild fever was gone. Headache was no longer. Each day thereafter, my head seemed to be more cognitive/clearer and looking back, I could tell I was not thinking clearly, with difficulty remembering things. Since I was not working, fogginess had zero impact on my lifestyle. I should note the first shot, received on 2/13/2021, I had no effects at all. Nothing. Since I was not feeling very well during this time, I tended towards comfort foods which elevated my blood sugar, but that returned to normal levels by 3/9/2021.

Continued vertigo, but no nausea, for the rest of that day.  Vertigo symptoms have continued, but eased considerably from severity at onset.

Condition is not severe enough at this point to inhibit any activities, but is still present.

I then was assisted to the bed, where my left arm and left leg felt numb. I rested assuming this would fade away, being I has some numbness from the 1st vaccine.  On 3/24/21, as I attempted to get up from the bed,   I could not maintain my  balance and gait. The numbness was still in my entire left arm and entire left leg, yet I was able to raise move and wiggle my limbs, toes, fingers to a degree.

                                                lightheaded while working out; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 69-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3246, expiry date: unknown), intramuscular on 10Jan2021 15:00 at single dose (Arm Left; either deltoid or bicep, he is assuming it was his deltoid it was high enough) for COVID-19 immunization (65 and over). Medical history included ongoing Allergic to penicillin (discovered when he was a child), Food allergy (discovered when he was a child, allergy is mainly shellfish), allergy-induced asthma (diagnosed as a child). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Vaccination Facility Type: patient stated it was like a drive-in clinic in a field. The patient got vaccinated yesterday. He felt lightheaded while working out today on 11Jan2021 (about 9-9:30 a.m, unspecified). It was also reported that the lightheadedness only lasted 30-40 minutes. He verified he has recovered completely from it. The lightheadedness happened specifically when he started using weights. He clarified further it was when he was using the cable machine, working with weights/resistance. He wasn&#39;t when he was doing cardio or stretching or working on his core. It was when he was using his cable machine which would include weights and he had to stop. It was stated tht he is looking at the risks and side effects on the fact sheet and it didn&#39;t say anything about lightheadedness, so he thought maybe he should report it. It&#39;s not on the list, but he doesn&#39;t know if its from the vaccine. He also noticed while looking at the fact sheet, where it says signs of a severe reaction, one of the signs is dizziness and weakness. He doesn&#39;t know if what he experienced was the same thing. He thought it was lightheadedness but he may have felt dizziness. He doesn&#39;t know. To him, it was more lightheadedness, but it could have been dizziness. He had to stop working out. He asked what happens now, if they will look into this. He is scheduled to have his second shot on 31Jan2021. He knows a few people who experienced pain and extreme tiredness after getting the second vaccine. He declined to complete a report in regards to these people, stating he just heard 2 other individuals both said after getting the second shot, they were experiencing a lot of pain, didn&#39;t feel good. Felt may be 75% for one day, that&#39;s all he knows. He asked if he should get the second shot or wait to hear from anyone. He doesn&#39;t know if the lightheadedness is a result of getting the shot or something else. Patient states the only thing the card says is the product name and manufacturer. He sees Pfizer and then EL3246. He is not sure if the second digit is the letter &#34;L&#34; or the number 6. This is what is handwritten. He doesn&#39;t see anything else on the literature of the card. No further information was provided or obtained. The outcome of the event was recovered on 11Jan2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Not sure if delayed reaction because it was a week out.  Symptoms included delayed injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, 99.2 temp, injection site red (delayed and only on 7th day), nausea, feeling unwell, dizziness, weakness, and hives which were relieved with Benedryl.    Most of the symptoms began on Monday, February 8th and worsened on Tuesday, February 9th with hives.  There was no shortness of breath or respiratory issues.  Injection site was only tender on day of injection but tender and red on the 9th only.  Fatigue, headache,  hives continued on February 10th along with a slight bout of diarrhea.  Called clinic and they requested he go in and be tested for Covid-19 and results should be known in 2 days.  February 11th seemed to be better and as of 10:00 a.m. PST no hives but still itching and slight fatigue.  Again,  didn&#39;t know if it could be a reaction since it is a week out or something else.

I couldn&#39;t walk or stand without holding on to something, touching the wall, a chair, or kitchen counter top, etc. It looked like everything was moving sideways. I measured my BP and O2; BP = 119/77, HR = 80; O2 = 98%, HR =77. I also felt nauseous and only had a piece bread with butter. I took a Nautamine tablet and slept for about 2 hrs, until 10:30. Things were better, I could move around and back to normal by 2 pm.

A 69-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood clots (reported as blood thinner). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 2019 and ongoing as blood thinner. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Feb2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization which gave him severe diarrhea, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, a sore arm and it wore him out. After the second dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 which was administered in a public health department, the patient experienced sore arm. He was concerned because around 02:00 on 19Mar2021, he got up to go to the bathroom and noticed his left leg was basically numb and rubbery.  As soon as he tried to stand up, he fell. He thought the second vaccine was the one everyone says will be harder than the first. They even gave him a sheet of paper that scared the hell out of him. Thought he was okay after the second vaccine until around 02:00. At first, he thought his leg had just gone to sleep. It was like having noodles for legs. The patient has been urinating almost non-stop which also started around 02:00, this was what woke him up. He had to crawl on hands and knees after falling to get into the bathroom, he had no strength except a smidgen of strength in the right leg. On 18Mar2021, while eating dinner, he had trouble holding his fork and did not think much about it. He had a cramp feeling in right hand. Today, while eating lunch with a fork, he also had a difficulty. The patient eats with his right hand. The patient has been trying to learn how to walk since early this morning. He has worn out his wife since she was cleaning up after him in the bathroom and helping him walk. He couldn&#39;t walk to the commode very well, couldn&#39;t hold his water, and has been making a mess all day. He was at first afraid he was having a stroke but had no stroke symptoms. The patient reported that his weight was 201, then mentioned that during the night he thought about how much he was urinating and got on the scale out of curiosity and it said he weighs 191. At this time, his leg weakness persists but he was able to stand and hold his own body weight. Issue with holding fork and cramp feeling in right hand was persisting. Urinating was persisting and stated he was going about every 2 hours and goes a lot. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 17Mar2021; unknown for stroke, fall, and weight loss; and not recovered for all other events.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

                                                Vision problems (partial loss of vision for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision for minutes); Vision problems (partial loss of vision for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision for minutes); Vision problems (partial loss of vision for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision for minutes); Dizziness, Giddiness, lightheadedness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional. A 69-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 12Feb2021 at 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at 69-years-old as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks of the suspect vaccine. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. Medical history included blood pressure high (HBP) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, atrial fibrillation (A-fib) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing; and relevant past drug history: Yes, as reported (no details provided). Concomitant medications included nebivolol hydrochloride (BYSTOLIC) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; hydrochlorothiazide (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; losartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and others as reported. On 12Feb2021 at 14:00, the patient experienced: vision problems (partial loss of vision for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision for minutes) (hospitalization, medically significant), and dizziness, giddiness, lightheadedness (hospitalization).  The patient was hospitalized for the events for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram (CT): result was not provided on an unspecified date, echocardiogram: result was not provided on an unspecified date, Nasal Swab: negative on 24Apr2021 (post vaccination). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, which included CT and echocardiogram (as reported). The clinical outcome of the events: vision problems (partial loss of vision for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision for minutes) was recovered on an unspecified date. The clinical outcome of the events: dizziness, giddiness, lightheadedness was recovering.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a temporal association, a causal relationship between the reported events partial vision loss for a few seconds, unfocused spots in vision, double vision and dizziness, and the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. The causality was confounded by the patients preexisting cardiovascular conditions including hypertension and atrial fibrillation and multiple concomitant medications.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

                                                He had the vaccine, and around 5:00 PM said he had weakness and he fell to the floor.  Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

A 70-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9265) intramuscular, on 01Feb2021 at 08:00 (at the age of 70 years old), for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 01Feb2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced severe hypoglycemic event (POC=38)/hypoglycemia and chest pain. He was found driving the wrong way down the highway with no memory of the event, once stopped by authorities. He was admitted to the hospital with hypoglycemia and chest pain. His home diabetes coverage was an insulin pump and there was denial of decreased PO intake. The insulin pump was stopped once the patient was admitted. His glucose improved and insulin regular SSI was initiated. He was brought for cardiac cath on 02Feb2021 with no new issues seen. The patient was stabilized, was set for follow-up with PCP and endocrinologist and discharged on 04Feb2021. The events resolved on an unspecified date in Feb2021.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                While getting dressed, experienced dizziness and lost my balance.  I may have even blacked out for a few seconds because don&#39;t remember falling.  Lost coloring in my face, wife said I looked yellow.  Rested for the entire day due to continued slight dizziness. I may have been dehydrated since I didn&#39;t drink a lot of water after the vaccination and came home and worked around the house the entire rest of the day. Note: I wasn&#39;t advised to stay hydrated.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                My left arm muscle located on underarm between elbow and injection site, halfway between elbow and injection site higher up became extremely sore to the touch and prevented me from lifting my arm to preform functions.  Today is much better and function has mostly returned. The reason I am reporting is because I just (jan.29 2021) tore my rotator cuff on right  shoiulder and the loss of function is similar. Function is returning on left arm so no worried, the right shoulder will need shoulder replacement surgery.  But that was the effect on this adverse event. Loss of function to left arm about 3 days with improvement after 36 hours. Kind of a delayed response, so not sure its related. But I didn&#39;t injure the left so probably related.

On April 30, 2020 8 days after second shot while taking a walk and walked like a drunken sailer to the right until stopped by a fence.   Conditions passed after a minute and I went to emergency room .  They found I had bigeminy but ruled out stroke with complete brain MRI and heart ultrasound. It is not yet clear whether the balance issue if inner ear or the bigeminy.  Have monitor and will be consulting with cardiologist and ear doctors to gain clarity.

                                                Pfizer\BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine On Jan. 27, late in the morning I started to develop a stiff neck which was mild at the beginning, but in the afternoon  became very strong that I could not turn my head. It progressed to hurt considerably by the time to go to bed that I had to support my head with a towel around my neck.  I took a Flurbiprofen 100mg before going to bed and I had the my neck massaged with Aspercream.   I sleep on the sides and moving from one side to the other I had to support my head with my hands. This morning (Jan. 28) the pain went a little down, but looking to the sides was painful. Around noon I took another Flurbiprofen. Tomorrow? Will see.  Now, in the evening, the pain slightly increase again and spreading toward the shoulder blades and  lower on the spine.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male patient with a complex medical history with multiple problems and cancers and debilities.  He received a second dose of COVID vaccine yesterday about midday.  Shortly thereafter, he started having shivers and shakes.  The concern that I had when he called the office was a possible bacteremia.  He was sensitive emergency room for evaluation.  He was noting that he was chilled and was unable to get warm. He said his temperature was up to 100.5.  He had generalized weakness and inability to get up and walk and had malaise.  He has no known exposures to pneumonia or other illnesses.  He has basically been homebound for the past year with the COVID.  He was evaluated in the emergency room and found to have an elevated white blood cell count on the right upper lobe pneumonia on portable chest x-ray.  Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained since he had a urine abnormality as well.  The patient was admitted to observation while we wait on cultures and we treat the pneumonia with antibiotics.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

Rushed him to Urgent Care, they sent him home and the next day I took him to ER. He was admitted. MRIs, CT scan, Blood Cultures, 2 Covid tests.  Nothing definitive as to why he was so ill other then a viral infection.   We are not assuming or indicating it is vaccine related but we think it&#39;s worth noting.  Nothing in his routine had changed other then receiving the 1st vaccine.   No one at the hospital indicated it was related.

A 71-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 06Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included liver transplant, Patient&#39;s liver transplant was 6 years ago. A-Fib from an unknown date. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital in (Name). Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter believes that patients sister has A-Fib. There were no concomitant medications. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Patient received a flu vaccine way back in Aug2020. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was Not provided. It was reported that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer of the vaccine was on 24Mar2021, Wednesday, at 4pm. On Thursday, usual fatigue, that people get, Friday morning, diarrhea 1 bout, and dizziness, gave him water, HR erratic 80, 90 to 70 into 100, which as like AFib, BP went to 64/55, put in in w/c had him lay down, hand cold, weak, drain. He drank electrolyte water. started to take BP and HR and Oxygen level, his Blood pressure was 64/55, She called PCP, the nurse got on the phone and asked questions, and monitor what had happened, monitored Heart rate until 20 minutes it became regulated, in the 90s and staying in the 90s. If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue.

Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit. Patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 90s at least it was fluctuating within the 90s. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient also had low blood pressure. The patient continued to drink cold water, and the reporter was monitoring him. The patient did not go into A-Fib again the next day. Reporter has called several people. Reporter has called transplant people, and patients primary care physician. Reporter was asking them questions about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they thought it was an allergic reaction. Reporter asked them if it could happen again with the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital. Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress.

Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism from 2020 and ongoing; and morniflumate (FLOMAX tablet 4 mg) taken for prostate and urinary problems from an unspecified date (reported as 5 or more years) and ongoing. The patient did not have prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 06Apr2021 at 17:00, 5 hours after the vaccination, the patient experienced fever (103.2 degrees), lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair, needed help getting him in and out of bed, conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space, chills, and was so cold that his fingertips were blue. On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. The reporter further explained that the patient experienced chills, fever, lost the lability to walk and needed a wheelchair, and needed help getting help in and out of bed. She stated he was unresponsive but clarified that he was conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space. The chills lasted for less than an hour. She put a heating blanket on him. She added that he was so cold that his fingertips were blue. The chills ended and he ran into a fever which lasted for 10 hours. She mentioned that if his fever would have been greater than 105 degrees, she would have sent him to the emergency room. The highest it reached was 103.2 degrees. She gave him Tylenol and cold compresses which brought his temperature down to 101. He was comfortable. Initially, on an unspecified date, his breathing, color and blood pressure were all good. While he had a fever, she observed that to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. From a cardiovascular view he is healthy. The local paramedics come and check on him periodically and the reporter monitors his glucose and blood pressure (unknown results). She stated that all of these were complicated by him having dementia. The reporter stated that he was getting better. She was not panicked and was not complaining. She wanted the officials to know that she thinks people who have had Covid should be tested to see the level of antibodies present or a titer test before having the vaccine and that maybe they not need the vaccine. The events did not require visits to emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The reporter assessed the events &#34;Fever (103.2 degrees)&#34;, &#34;lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair&#34;, &#34;needed help getting him in and out of bed&#34;, &#34;conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space&#34;, &#34;fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths&#34; as serious (medically significant). The patient recovered from chills on 06Apr2021 (after less than an hour), &#34;Fever (103.2 degrees)&#34; on 07Apr2021 03:00, &#34;fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths&#34; on 07Apr2021, &#34;conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space&#34; on 12Apr2021; recovered with sequel from &#34;lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair&#34;, &#34;needed help getting him in and out of bed&#34; on 09Apr2021; and was recovering from &#34;was so cold that his fingertips were blue&#34;.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based from know drug safety profile and sequence of events,  the reported events in relation to suspected drug BNT162B2 cannot be totally excluded.

Monday evening around 6pm: Chills started, sinus congestion, runny nose, general weakness,  shortness of breath. I took a hot shower and later used a rescue inhaler and was able to get my breathing back to normal. I  dressed in warm clothes and went to bed fully dressed around 10pm. 8am Tuesday I got up after a sound sleep and the symptoms were mostly gone except for a little sinus pressure and some joint soreness.

                                                Patient expired. Per Emergency MD note: &#34;This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.&#34;

ER or Hip Surgeon can find no reason, tell me I?ve strained my hip somehow. I?m at 2 weeks now, and can still not walk without severe pain and a walker. Wish I had never got the vaccine, and definitely won?t get the second vaccination!!!

                                                Patient reported he did not have any significant reactions to the first dose of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine given on 3/3/21. I have counseled patient on possible side effects and patient said he has no question. He looked fine after receiving the vaccine. However, after about 5 minutes, the wife who also received the second dose at the same time said he&#39;s not feeling well. I immediately went to check on patient and asked how he is feeling. Patient said he is feeling dizzy but has no problem in breathing. Wife and I were supporting patient in case he fell. I directed technician to call 911 and call for support from the front. Patient looked pale and hands were shaking. I kept talking to patient to keep his attention because he looked like he was about to faint. I had wife removed his mask in case if he had trouble breathing. Patient said he felt better after sitting for awhile. I checked his BP which was 68/48 and HR was 49. Patient said his normal BP was over 130. EMT arrived and checked his vitals and took him to ER due to low BP and HR. I called to follow up with patient after 6 hours. I spoke with wife who indicated that ER monitored patient and discharged him. Since he got home, he threw up 2-3 times but he was ok when I called and was resting. I counseled wife to ensure he stayed hydrated and if he gets worse, then she needs to take him to the hospital again. Within an hour, wife came to the pharmacy and said she&#39;s taking her husband to the hospital again. Wife has no reaction to second dose. She said she took aspirin just in case but she is fine.

It became so bad that I could only walk about 5-10 feed before becoming totally exhausted, needing to sit down for a few minutes.  My heart rate remained sinus-tach running up to 120&#39;s.  On March 4, 2021 I had an appointment with Dr.   He sent me to the Hospital to have a CTA.  The test was positive for a MASSIVE bilateral PE.  Doppler studies of my lower extremities showed a partially occluded Palpitate vein in my right leg.  I was admitted to the hospital and started on Heparin IV.  I was also taken to the Cath- lab where I underwent a Thrombectomy of my right lung.  The Cath-lab quit working so the procedure was stoped and the left lung was not treated.  On admission to the hospital my O2 sat was 97%.  After the thrombectomy my O2 sat went to 83%.  I was placed on Hiigh-flow O2 via nasal cannual.  On March 8th I was started on Lovenox SQ for 30 day and discharged from the hospital on March 9th.  I am now on Eliquis 5 mg bid and doing much better.

Medical history included COVID-19 prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in Feb2021 (at the age of 72-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. For the past 10 weeks, since the second dose of vaccination, the muscle pain and weakness had worsened to the point of near immobility. It took both hands to lift a half full coffee cup, and patient could barely manage that. Patient could not raise his arms above shoulder height, his knees and other joints did not want to bend, and he was in constant pain. Patient had had to receive five (5) steroid shots in an attempt to counteract this, and the doctor had stated he could receive no more. Patient contacted his doctor&#39;s office and local health department, but neither could help me. Patient was healthy and had no such issues before the shot, and now he was in the worst condition of my life. All these events with start date 09Mar2021, resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, and received treatment Steroid Shots. Since the vaccination, patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                30 hours after immunization, my lower left leg began to hurt. Within four hours I could barely walk. There was no swelling or redness present. It was a muscle pain in my calf and behind my knee. I took Tylenol and went to bed. The following day the pain was less intense, and I wore a compressive knee brace. On the second morning the pain had subsided and I could walk with a limp. The following day, all symptoms had disappeared. I did not seek medical advice.

                                                The morning after receiving second dose, I awoke with a headache, no strength at all and  no bladder control.  It took me forty five minutes to get out of bed after numerous attempts.  I also experience dizziness, balance issues.  In all honesty, it was as if I had gotten Covid all over again.  I had it in late August and all of September.  The second day after the shot, I experienced lack of strength, but not as bad as the first day, and whole body muscle aches.  The third day after,  was about the same and after that, things started getting a  little better.

Uneasy sleep, awoke the following morning in a sweat, with overall discomfort and nausea, began to retch and vomit for nearly 13 hrs. throughout the only comfort was to sit in a hot shower till the hot water ran out sometime falling into a deep sleep, I did this many times through the day, Accompanying this was a general fog and complete loss of equilibrium, extreme weakness. this made it difficult to move from bed to bath or anywhere in my home. I am writing this at 5:13 am Mar  6 and find it hard to gather thoughts.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

Never had a fever. All of a sudden, around 2:30PM all dissipated, it was all gone and I was fine. A week later I called my PCP because the symptoms came back - the lethargy. He suggested me to go to the ER. I went and could barely write my name on the sign in sheet at the hospital. They did 5 COVID tests and 4 of them were negative. I was at the ER for 3 days and finally was admitted and stayed for 11 days.  I was sent home with oxygen and my levels are finally getting back to 92/93.  I can&#39;t walk at this time. I lost 17 lbs and if I try to walk my lungs shut down. ( I went to the ER n 01/07 and was discharged on the 17th - I was also at the ER the week before when they tested me and it kept coming back negative) My pulmonary MD

Doctor started me on Eliquis blood thinner to hopefully desolve the blood clot on my lung. Doctor suggested I report Pulmonary Embolism occuring same day as my first vaccine shot. Do not know if shot caused Pulmonary Embolism or just a coinsidence. In addition doctor found blood in my urine and a CT of Bladder has been ordered

I sent an email to my PCP and she said there is a lot of side effects with the vaccine. After two days I was fine.

This 74-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered on the arm left on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;maybe I don&#39;t know 6198, it&#39;s GN or EN&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, broken back, breathing problem because of his heart and lung, his lungs have problem, he had some nodules in it, and kidney stone once 25 years ago, 5 little stones. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had a reaction, it is the worst reaction he has ever had in his life, the pain he had, he was almost paralyzed and couldn&#39;t walk after vaccine and he had to get a wheelchair because he couldn&#39;t stand on his feet. He ended up in the emergency room. The vaccine put him out of work, and now he can work some. He is trying to make it up in two days, today and tomorrow to finish up. He was very upset and wanted to know why this happened to him. The patient stated that other people he talked to had no reaction, if they had a fever or anything it was gone in a coupled days, but he ended up in the emergency room. On 01Mar2021, patient had his first dose and at 02:30, he got out of the facility and came out okay with no problem. At 21:00, all of a sudden he saw that he could not stand up on his feet and he fell awake. He waited in the bed, people around him got worried. Eventually, he asked them to bring wheelchair, maybe he can drive. He drove home with his wife to the emergency from his house and he got admitted in emergency and he was screaming so bad, he did not believe in his life, he never heard somebody doing like this. He felt like somebody getting chills like somebody cutting his side, on his lower abdomen on the right side. It&#39;s underside of the lower abdomen, he had slight pain every single day, sometime excruciating, he took Ibuprofen for it. He thought he had a kidney stone because he had it once 25 years ago, 5 little stones, so they took him to emergency, took him to the CT scan. They didn&#39;t find anything, but the pain was excruciating and in the emergency room everybody thought the crazy man is here who is screaming. He couldn&#39;t control his scream. He couldn&#39;t walk, he couldn&#39;t move. Every movement was like you put a knife on the cutting, it was that bad. His second dose was due on 22Mar2021. He went to the pharmacy and asked them the number and let them know that he had a reaction like this and they called somebody and said to cancel the shot. They cancelled it. That day for 3 days, patient had the pain, it was slowly because he had to take eventually oxycodone. The doctor advised in the emergency room that nothing was wrong, just to slow down the pain but he was not allowed to take the oxycodone. He took the 10 mg oxycodone and the pain which was an hour and a half was a little bit down. After 3 hours, it was a little better, he didn&#39;t want to scream, it was gone but the pain was still there for at least 3 days, really bad. He was taking ibuprofen and a muscle relaxant. He did all those things and still I have the pain left and he did not know what to do with that. The lab test he had, he had been okay, he did not have any problem. He got the result on 22Mar2021. Outcome of the events pain and abdominal pain was not recovered and of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 74years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL9262) on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 74years) for Covid-19 immunization and stated no reactions. Medical history included high blood pressure and diabetes but are all currently under control and feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered. It was reported that in the past the doctors thought he experienced TIA (transient ischemic attack) but wasn&#39;t sure if that was accurate. Concomitant medications included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL), trazodone (TRAZODONE), insulin (INSULIN), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and prednisone (PREDNISONE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that on 19Feb2021 the patient received the 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine and stated he remember feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered earlier. On Sunday 21Feb2021, the reporter (patient&#39;s wife) began noticing that the patient was showing symptoms of a stroke. The patient&#39;s one leg was rapidly kicking, and his speech began to slur. The patient was then rushed to ER (emergency room) and hospitalized. At the hospital it was confirmed that the patient was having a stroke. The patient recovered and was doing rehab for his leg. Few weeks later, the patient had an accident in his home while getting up to go to the bathroom and fell. The patient was rushed to the Trauma center. The patient&#39;s wife was upset as she carried their vaccine cards to the trauma center to confirm to staff that the patient did not need another Covid vaccine shot and later found out that the patient was given a 3rd (Moderna Covid vaccine) at the trauma center. The patient stated that he does not think the vaccine was related but was upset that the trauma center did not listen to her to take the info with the complete vaccine card present to avoid 3rd shot from another brand. The patient&#39;s insulin levels are under control, but the reporter was concerned when the patient does not eat within a certain timeframe. The outcome of events stroke and speech disorder was recovered on an unspecified date; outcome of event fall was unknown.

A contactable consumer reported that a 74-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162b2(COMIRNATY, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207, Expiration: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 19Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history includes Arthritis (arthritis is in his right foot only and his big toe, diagnosed in 2017 or 2018) and Concomitant medication were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY) on 26Feb2021 for Covid-19 immunisation and Unspecified steroid shot. Stated reaction was three to four days. First shot got caller and patient down for a week. Second shot got caller down for three days. At first, patient&#39;s reaction was running like hers. Patient had a dry cough on an unspecified date in 2021. Was going for a COVID test today. Last week patient started running a fever on an unspecified date in 2021 and his legs were extremely weak on 14Apr2021. Has to hold onto something to go through the house on 14Apr2021. He was moving a little better, but not much. Patient had to go to doctor for his foot. Has terrible arthritis in the big toe on his right foot. Gets steroid shot every three months. Three weeks and four days after second COVID shot everything seemed to have worn off. The PA put the shot in his foot and it bruised the patient. Patient still has bruises on an unspecified date in 2021. Got the steroid shot in his big toe and two days later the weakness hit a second time. It really wiped him out. Caller cannot help patient get up and down. Patient was struggling with his legs and was aching. Wants to know if a steroid shot on top of the COVID shot and that close after would cause another reaction? The PA said it was ok to get a steroid shot three weeks after. Patient started having these reactions and doesn&#39;t know if it was the COVID shot. Has had steroid shots every 3 months for 4 years. Has never had this kind of reaction. Patient didn&#39;t think about getting the steroid shot because he seemed to be feeling fine. Reaction started the next morning and it was even worse on an unspecified date in 2021. By the third day after the shot he was down and caller couldn&#39;t help patient get up. It scared the caller. Patient also broke out in a rash across his shoulders and down both arms. States her husband has had both shots and he has been having issues since the second one n 19MAR2021. Reporter states 3 weeks and 4 days after the second vaccine, her husband had to have a steroid shot in his foot because he has terrible arthritis in his right foot. Reporter states the patient has had a flare up since then with weakness in his legs and a rash on his chest. States the only difference this time is that he had just had the second Covid vaccine 3 weeks prior. States he has not had steroid reactions in the past, and she feels like this reaction was because of the Covid vaccine. Clarifies the shot in his foot was on 13Apr2021 and she does not know what steroid was injected. States it was 3weeks and 4 days between the steroid injection and the vaccine. States maybe they should war people not to get a steroid shot for a longer time after the vaccine. States after the first vaccine for about 5 days they were just laid out. States they ate soup and whatever they could warm up in the microwave. States his ear doctor said if they reacted to the first shot they must have had Covid at sometimes. States she doesn&#39;t know, they never got tested before but they didn&#39;t have any symptoms. States her husband&#39;s test yesterday was negative. Weakness in the Legs AE: States for the last 2 days, he could not even get up on his own and she can&#39;t lift him because he was bigger than she was. Rash was states it was not itching or anything, just a rash. States it was odd because she has had hives, and this was just broken out. Clarifies the rash was across his upper back, chest, and down both arms on 14Apr2021. States it was kind of like speckled on his body like the measles on an unspecified date in 2021. States the patient was 74 years old and he had measles when he was a kid just like she did, so it is not the measles. States the patient had a Covid 19 test done yesterday and it came back negative, so he doesn&#39;t have Covid. She doesn&#39;t know what it was. Treatment: states he was taking Motrin for the Aching. States she does not know if the reaction was because the PA did the injection, it had always been the doctor that had given the injection. Caller states she thinks it was getting the steroid injection on top of receiving the Covid shot. States the both received their vaccines because they couldn&#39;t get a shot because they weren&#39;t giving shots at her age, so when offered them the vaccine, they jumped on it. Yes, last Monday to his Nurse Practitioner, did not address the weakness in his legs because did not know what to do for that. She did not even say what she thought it was, said he needed to see someone about that but does not know who to see, does not know whether to go to the ER or who to go to. Not that emergent but when doctor does not know what to treat with worrisome. She was calling about to finish the report and to speak with the Medical department regarding if this has been reported before or if any information on the Covid vaccine and steroid injections. He received the 1st dose on 26Feb2021 and the 2nd dose on 19Mar2021. She mentioned that both of them experienced achiness, sore all over after the 1st dose and flu-like symptoms on an unspecified date in 2021 after both doses. Her husband however, had muscle weakness on his legs after the 2nd dose. On 13Apr2021, about 3 weeks and 4 days after the 2nd dose, her husband received a steroid shot on his right foot. They noticed that the weakness on his legs became extreme, to which he had trouble standing up and has to hold on to something to stand up as he cannot support himself. He also had a rash on his trunk, back, and down his arms. She mentioned that the rash was not itchy but was speckled like measles. They were wondering if this has been reported and if it was possibly an interaction between the vaccine and steroid. They mentioned that they already consulted with their HCP but said that they really cannot tell. Outcome of his legs were extremely weak, has to hold onto something to go through the house was not recovered while with other event rash is across his upper back, chest, and down both arms, Achy all over was recovered on 22Mar2021 and flu-like symptoms after both doses and Sore all Over was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021, while with other events was unknown.  Follow up attempts were needed. Further information is expected.

No abdominal pain.  No vomiting or diarrhea.  No black or bloody stools.  No dizziness.  Today he almost fell and the son had to catch him.  He did not suffer any trauma.  He offers no symptoms of pain.  Here he is fully awake and alert.  Nothing to clinically suspect a stroke.  His vitals are stable.  Chest x-ray shows nothing acute.  Creatinine is better than baseline.  Electrolytes are stable.  Troponin reassuring.  He had no chest pain or shortness of breath to suspect angina.  Spoke to the wife via telephone, he is getting so weak that he was unable to walk.  Paramedics report they had lift him as he could not take a step.  He was unable to ambulate here in the emergency room.  At this time it does not seem like I can safely discharge him home.

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

                                                On March 15 I started experiencing pain in both hips as I was walking.  This pain continued and a few days later I started to experience pain in my lower back in addition to the pain in my hips.  It was very hard to walk and if I went too far or long I had to stop and wait for the pain to lessen.  The pain had lessened but is still present.  on about March 20/21 I noticed a blister on the index finger of my right hand.  A rash showed up on my left arm in the area of my wrist on March 23.  It is now March 25 and the rash all over my whole body.  It itches and at times is painful.
