And because of this he was little pale in color and he had no local reaction to the vaccine on his arm and he was communicating with us. we did call the ems services and they took him  to the ambulance and per father he was let go after some time in the ambulance once he felt better.

                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

Once I got to the patient he had come to, mom said he was out for about 10-15 seconds max and patient says he did hit his head. Oxygen saturation was 99% on RA, heart rate was 62bpm. BP 110/78. Patient was alert and oriented once I was assessing him. He was able to sit up in the floor about 5 minutes after coming to. He was able to drink water and the PCT had placed cool wet paper towels on his head and neck area. We provided the patient crackers and the management team was available. The patient said he felt like his stomach was upset and did not want the crackers. I suggested he go to the ER and mom said she would drive him and asked if this was caused by the vaccine itself. I explained what could have occurred and educated them on where he hit his head he needs to go to the ER to be assessed. Mom agreed and the manager got a wheelchair from the front of the store and mom drove him to the ER. I called report to ER.

                                                The next morning he woke up with arm  hurting him (he couldn&#39;t lift it). He felt a little warm - had a low grade fever -99.something. He had a headache all day. He was very sluggish, tired. He did online school that day. He took a nap and laid down on the couch in between classes. He was really tired. I was giving him Tylenol every four hours. The first time he felt a little better, The second time, it didn&#39;t work. I called the doctor for advice and he told me to give him Children&#39;s Motrin. That seemed to do better. I gave that to him once that day.  The next morning, he felt better. I gave him a Motrin anyway  because he had a light headache. He did say he felt some heart racing. And he was a little tired. He called me from school around 11:30 am and he said that his heart has been racing through the whole morning - he was gym and said  he couldn&#39;t run or anything but his heart was racing. I told him to go to t he school nurse - he had a pulse of 120. I met him there and I called the pediatrician and he saw him at 03:00. His pulse was high but not as high as before. He had rested in between. My son did see a cardiologist in June 2020- they put him on a heart monitor and she couldn&#39;t find anything at that time. At the regular doctor on the 19th, the doctor checked breathing and heart but did not have the materials at that location to do an EKG but said with the lowered heart rate just to watch and if it goes up again to go to Cardiologist we saw in June 2020. He rested some more and it went away on it&#39;s own. After that he was fine and no other issues. In fact, the next day he felt better and was running around and had energy and felt great.

He then walked upstairs in our home and passed out-he was out for around 30 seconds. Afterward, his temp was still 99.9 and he began to experience vertigo. The vertigo lasted until Friday May 21.

                                                Vaccine given at 5:19 pm. After the vaccine, mom took pt and walked around the store rather than stay in the waiting area. They returned at approximately 5:45 pm, because pt was complaining of a bad headache rating pain 6/10. He denied any other symptoms. We had him sit down in the waiting area and gave him a bottle of water. He started feeling lightheaded a few minutes later and was moved to an exam room. I had him lay down on the exam table. At approx. 5:55pm, I checked his BP while he was laying down and it was 104/62. He reported feeling a little better, so I had him sit up. Rechecked BP and it was 108/70. He reported dizziness had resolved and headache was now 5/10. At some point while I was not with the pt, mom gave him some Aleve, but I don&#39;t know what time. Mom decided to take him home at that point.

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

We were transported 911 to Hospital ED where he had normal labs, normal brain MRI, and consultation with Peds Neuro. He was post-ictal for 30&#43; minutes to follow the incident. He has secondary trauma to his R temporal and occipital bones and likely a mild concussion resulting from the fall.

                                                Patient had a syncopal reaction: skin became hot and clammy, patient was dizzy, upon asking him to repeat a command or do a simple action (like wiggling fingers, lifting arm) he was not responding and his eyes were rolling to the back of his head and would not vocalize (when asked if ok, or what his symptoms were, or if he was having trouble breathing) at which time we called 911 since he was not responding verbally or physically.  Had him sit, take off his mask, gave him water to sip, took BP (102/60), within 5 minutes he started to come back around, was able to follow command (wiggle fingers) vocalize that he could breathe fine, and felt that there was water behind his ears. His temperature to touch seemed to start to go back down, and once paramedics arrived they evaluated him and released him as &#34;ok&#34; within 10 minutes.

                                                At first patient was fine just sore arm.  Approx 2pm the next day we were at Aunt&#39;s house &amp; he became very sleepy and fell asleep outside.  I nudged him to see if he was okay and he couldn&#39;t lift his head up all he said was &#34;I hate you&#34; (he didn&#39;t want the shot and I had a feel well)  I kept nudging him to go inside and he didn&#39;t react.  Finally after 25 min I had my brother in law carry him upstairs.  He didn&#39;t wake up for it (the kid is 13 that never happens).  Every hour I checked on him and he wouldn&#39;t wake up.  I am a nurse do figured the shot made him tired but I did start to get anxious I even sternal rubbed him and he reacted to pain but would not wake up.  Finally around 445 I told my husband we need to make him drink something and I stood him up he would not wake up.  I was trying everything but we got him up enough to gulp down some gatorade.  We put on his sneakers and he basically sleptwalked down the stairs went right to car and fell asleep again.  It was like he was too tired to stay awake.  We got him home and around 515 kept him sitting up in kitchen.  Took him about 20 min to fully open eyes and wake up.    When he was fully awake he said it was like the shot moved from his arm to his whole body when it happened and that was it.  He was sore and achy after that and even today to generalized body.  But he was fine as far as not lethargic after.

                                                Patient was given the shot at 9:36 am and was asked to sit down for 15 minutes to watch how he reacts with the vaccine. He had been very nervous and anxious before getting the shot because he never had a shot before and was afraid of needle. After around 5 minutes, his dad notified me that his son had upset stomach. I asked the patient if he ate or drank anything in the morning. His dad and he confirmed that he didn&#39;t eat or drink anything (because dad thought that he should not eat anything before getting the shot like getting blood drawn). He confirmed that he breathed okay and didn&#39;t have swelling of lip and throat. His father told me that his son did feel a little bit dizzy and sweating. Since the clinic is full of patients and humidy, I told him and his dad to sit in a room in clinic without patients and bring a fan to the room. After 15 minutes (around 9:51am), after drinking water and eating a banana, all the side effects were gone. He felt better, and he could watch videos/games and have full focus. At 10:24 am (which was more than 30 min resting in clinic), his father and he confirmed that he was feeling better and didn&#39;t have any side effects and decided to leave the clinic and go home.

                                                Immediately following the vaccine, my son felt totally fine. The pharmacist told us to walk around the store for 15 minutes. 8 minutes after the vaccine, my son said his arm felt tingly. He immediately began sweating profusely and said that he felt dizzy. I made him sit down and he then said that he felt nauseous. Within 5 minutes of the onset of symptoms, he vomited. He was pale and his forehead was cold/clammy. The pharmacist said it was anxiety and nothing to be concerned about. However, my son said that he did not feel worried, anxious, etc. prior to or immediately following the vaccine.

His eyes were rolling back,  he was shaking and his throat was making abnormal movements. His mother rushed over and bear-hugged him, and its like he came back to reality and was okay. We got him a cold pack, water, fruit snacks, a mat to lay on and a fan and the patient walked out okay. His reaction was directly after the shot and lasted about 5-10 seconds. Patient walked out of the facility fine and had his mother with him.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

                                                Patient passed out immediately following administration of the vaccine to the left deltoid. His head fell backwards and limp. The Rph administering the vaccine moved in front of the patient and gently moved his head into an upright position. The patient had mild muscle spasms and twitches while passed out but when he regained consciousness he immediately began talking saying he was ok. Father came into the consultation room at that point and Rph explained what had occurred. Patient looked a little pale and eyes were having a hard time staying open so with the help of his dad Rph helped him down to the ground in the corner of the room so he could have back and head support from the wall. Patient was given a glucose tablet and water, and later orange juice. Patient stayed in the consultation room for about 20 minutes before leaving on his own and saying he was feeling much almost back to normal.

                                                Pt received first shot of Pfizer vaccine on 5/14 - 12:30 PM EST. On 05/17 around 7:45 AM, Pt passed out/fainted. He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

He fell backward against a closed door and slid down.  He quickly regained consciousness and his vitals were stable.  within 10 minutes he was no longer dizzy or hot.  He was able to sit up right without issues.   Per dad, this is the same reaction he had to the flu vaccine in fall of 2020.

                                                Patient was administered the vaccine. After administration we stood talking to his mother who had questions. After about 2 minutes they turned to walk away and he lost consciousness and hit his head on a counter. I unfortunately did not witness him falling. He regained consciousness almost immediately and I told him he needed to stay laying down for a few minutes first. After a few minutes he said he felt fine and we moved him to a chair. Within a few minutes, he became ill again so we had him lay down again in the consultation room. He then laid there for about 15 minutes before we moved him to a chair. He stated that before he lost consciousness his heart was racing. His mother states he&#39;s never had any problems with vaccinations in the past. After sitting for the second time he said he felt fine except where he hit his head which was a little sore. We contacted the father later that night and he said that he too had a similar episode with a needle stick a few years prior. The patient felt better later night per his father.

He was quickly revived by his father, but still felt dizzy and complained of blurred vision.  Patient was given a bottle of water and comforted by his father and brother.  When I checked on him about 20-30 minutes later, he said he felt fine.  He  looked a lot better too.

He was very pale and sweaty.  With his mom&#39;s permission I activated an ammonia inhalant near his nose.  He said he felt better after the 2nd sniff.  After a couple minutes he said his symptoms were greatly diminished and he was ok.  The paramedics arrived and pt was able to walk to the ambulance for further evaluation.  A paramedic came back and said the patient is feeling much better and declined to go to the hospital.  I talked to the mom a couple hours later and she said he is all better.

After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

I reported to the closest worker and she called in another person, assuming one was a nurse and one was not.  She had him look into her eyes, which was difficult, then she had him out his head between his knees for a minute and he was then able to come out of it.  Still a bit dizzy, they moved him to a room with a bed where he could lie down and they put a cold, wet paper towel in his forehead.  He rested there for an additional 10 minutes.  They had him get up and walk before they allowed him to leave.  He had not eaten anything since the night before and he has severe ?needle anxiety ? which both could have contributed to the reaction.  He has not had any issues since, except for a sore arm.

                                                14yo male that was admitted to our hospital&#39;s cardiology service prior to after an episode of acute onset tachycardia (possible atrial tachycardia), dizziness, headache at school.  He had his first covid vaccine 8 days prior to the event at school.  He has a coincidental diagnosis of an anomalous left coronary off the right aortic valve cusps, but his coronary course is unusual where he would be very unlikely to be at risk for sudden cardiac arrest.  He had an ECHO in the ED that showed a mild left ventricular dysfunction (EF 45%).  He underwent a cardiac MRI on 5/28/2021 was done that was normal without myocardial edema or scarring.  His ejection fraction on that study (24 hours later) was 54%.  He was discharged home and had a stress test the following week (6/1/2021) that showed blocked PACs at peak exercise (a very usual finding for an otherwise healthy kid) and possible slow atrial tachycardia at baseline.  His laboratory evaluation including CRP and ESR was normal.  72 hour Holter monitor showed blocked PACs and no supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia.  Mother reports that he is &#34;back to baseline&#34; May 31st.    Of note, his father was covid positive with headache in October 2020.  The patient also had a headache for 1 week without fever.  It was presumed that he had covid as well, but was not tested per PCP recommendation.

According to the mother, the patient told her in the parking lot that he was having dizziness and a little bit of shortness of breath. So they came back to the pharmacy. The mother also stated that he had asthma when he was younger but that she suspected he grew out of it. He had no other symptoms of a possible allergic reaction. I gave him 10ml of Benadryl (25mg) as a precaution. They stayed 25 more minutes after Benadryl as a precaution, as the mother also contacted his physician for further directions. After that 25 minutes, the patient said he was feeling fine, and that they will be going to get something to eat.

Per vaccinator,  reports that client was saying, &#34;Wow that was aniclimactic&#34; after getting vaccine. Per vaccinator, she notices within 1-2 minutes client got quiet and then reported &#34;I am not feeling well.&#34;  Client received vaccine in left deltoid. RN requested PHN 1 to get gravity chair.  PHN grabbed gravity chair and asked RN to get BP cuff and pulse ox. PHN arrive to assess client and found client alert and oriented x 4 in chair at 5:53PM. Client was already drinking water given by vaccinator when PHN arrived.  Client reports he was experiencing &#34;dizziness and slight shortness of breath.&#34; PHN ask client if he thought he was steady enough to switch to gravity chair. Client stood up slowly and sat in the gravity chair. RN 1 asked client if his throat felt tight-client responds-&#34;No&#34; and coached client to take deep, slow breaths.  At 5:55PM vitals are: blood pressure: 130/90, pulse: 55 and oxygen: 98%.  At 5:57pm client reports no longer feeling shortness of breath.  Client is speaking in full sentences and able to answer all PHN questions about chest pain and headache and client reports having neither. At 6pm vitals: blood pressure:125/90, pulse:75, and oxygen:100%. PHN instruct RN to get Lead PHN  or Co-Lead. Client reports he has slight dizziness and feels lightheaded and reports that earlier he had blurred vision but now is seeing clearly.  At 6:03PM vitals are: blood pressure:160/100, client appears pale and heart rate:140, and oxygen: 100%.  Lead PHN  arrives to take over assessment and PHN starts calling 9-1-1 at 6:04PM as blood pressure is repeated by co-lead :180/90, oxygen100% and pulse 129 and upon auscultation hears clear lungs and heart palpitations.   Client is then reports shortness of breath and dizziness, no headache and no blurred vision.  Parent reports that client has a history of asthma but rarely needs inhaler so she does not have it on her and that client recently had been on antibiotics for Gastrointestinal history and a bad cough (not COVID)-all symptoms had been resolved before receiving vaccine.  At 6:07pm Vitals: blood pressure: 170/90, pulse:100%; no change in symptoms.  At 6:08pm vitals: blood pressure:170/90, pulse: 94, and oxygen: 100%, client reports experiencing tightness in chest and unable to complete breath. Client reports no chest pain. Vitals taken again by RN due to new symptom, blood pressure: 122/70, pulse:93 and oxygen: 100%.  RN auscultate again and hears palpitations have slowed and lungs clear. At 6:10PM, vitals are blood pressure:124/74 and pulse: 96. Client reports feeling &#34;shaky, tightness on chest&#34; and could not take full breaths.  Paramedics assumed care at 6:12pm.

A few minutes after receiving the vaccine and sitting in the observation area, the patient&#39;s father told the nurse that his son was feeling lightheaded, was sweating and appeared pale. EMTs were notified and approached the patient. The patient was laid onto the ground and his legs were elevated. EMTs did an assessment and vital signs. Reported that the patient was hypotensive. Dad stated that his son had not eaten anything yet today. He was then given juice and a small candy bar which he ate.

Dad remained at son&#39;s side until released to go home by EMS. Patient ambulated unassisted toward the car.
