                                                Patient was nervous upon receipt of vaccine.  It was an unscheduled (expiring) dose.  Per parent, he had fallen asleep outside vaccine room and they had to wake him up to get vaccine.   I gave immunization and asked him to stay for 15 minutes afterwards.  His Mom ran to consult window to notify staff patient was passing out.  I was sanitizing vaccine room so I immediately ran to him and his Dad and I caught him as he was slumping over.  He was shaking really hard, weak, and clammy.  He was coherent b/c I asked him his name but did not have clear recollection of timing of vaccine.  He was very pale in color.  His Mom grabbed him a Gatorade and he seemed very thirsty as he was drinking.  He mentioned he felt dizzy and that both arms were hurting and the arm I gave vaccine in felt like he had sweat dripping off it.  (I felt his arm and it did not).  I grabbed an instant cold pack and placed on his neck to help cool him off.  His color returned over the 30 minutes.  I asked parents if they wanted me to call ambulance but they wanted to wait and see how he responded.  He looked at his iPhone data and his heart rate had spiked.  Unclear if right before vaccine or right after but I believe he mentioned it went up to 120 when Mom said his normal resting heart rate was 60.  He ate some gold fish and seemed to perk up and have a few funny conversations showing his personality.  I explained to him very important to let parents know if he experienced any other side effects after leaving.  He was able to stand up and walk out of RX with parents.

His hands were clammy. He said he felt like his body was numb. We had him remove his mask and got him some water. He never actually lost consciousness. Eventually we had him lay down and put his feet up. His father was contacted and came to pick him up. We spoke to his mom later and she said he was feeling much better.

Patient vomited about 20 minutes later.  Our office was informed by mother around 10:30 am.  Patient at home and sleeping.  Advised Mom to take patient to local ED for further evaluation and monitoring.

                                                Patient started to feel dizzy for about one minute. His father states that patient was sitting up on a chair and he started to fall backward, so his father caught him and lowered him to the ground. He did not hit his head. He was not responsive for approximately 10 seconds, per the father. Clinical monitors arrived and patient was alert and oriented to name, place, date/time. He was slightly pale and clammy but he denied any dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, headache, changes in his vision/hearing, or nausea.  He was laying on his back on the ground with his legs elevated on a chair and he started to feel better, and his blood pressure and oxygen saturation were stable with mild bradycardia per the vital signs obtained by one RN. He said he was feeling better and he was smiling and joking with staff. He slowly started to sit up and sipped bottled water. Stated that he had not eaten since 11am, and he agreed to a snack.  I left to get him a snack, and RN said that he started to &#34;zone out&#34; and he lost consciousness again for approximately 20 seconds. When I came back, he was sitting up, conscious, and had spit up saliva and water onto his shirt. His breathing was steady.   He again stated that he was feeling better very quickly, again in good spirits, but his father and I agreed that it would be best to call 911 to transport him to the ER just to be safe. He did not hit his head. He denied dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, changes in vision,  and headache. He was alert and oriented to name, place, and time. EMS was requested and they arrived, took his vitals, and he was transported to the Emergency Dept for futher care.   He and his father were confident that he would recover quickly as he had a history of syncopal episodes related to vaccines in the past.

Patient started to sway and lost muscle control.  I helped to the floor and laid him out.  Patient conscious whole time and never stopped breathing.  Did not lose cognizance.  Had momentary feeling of nausea that immediately passed.  Did not believe necessary to call 9-1-1 as patient did not exhibit any allergy symptoms of any distress during the whole episode.  Allowed to lay on floor for about 5-10 min.  Supplied patient with bottle of water to help with dry mouth and he drank and felt better.  After another 10 minutes patient was up on feet and feltmuch better.  Mother called an hour and a half later (about 5 min ago as I prepare this form) to inform me that he was back to 100%.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after being administered with Pfizer COVID vaccine patient became lightheaded and almost fainted. Patient did not fall out of chair, but did slouch over in chair. The patient&#39;s father alerted pharmacy staff and the nurse administering vaccines today, and I went out to check on him. Patient was sitting up in chair at this time, but was very sweaty, pale and cloudy. Nurse instructed him to place his head down by his knees and provided him with water, Gatorade, and cold compresses. Once patient was feeling a little bit better we moved him into a private room with father and let him lay down at rest. When patient felt okay to leave he was advised to lay flat when he got home and eat. Father was also advised to stay with him until he was feeling 100%. Event lasted approximately 30 minutes.  A call was placed to parents around 3pm to check on him and he was doing well. (moving around and playing video games)

A 16-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: ER8736), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Apr2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 16-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications were none. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On 23Apr2021 at 09:45 (reported as 13 minutes after the vaccine), the patient said he was lightheaded and then fell out of the chair and hit the floor. He started making a gurgling/growling sound. After the nurses flipped him over, they noted that his right arm was contracted and tight. They were unable to determine if he had passed out or had a seizure. He had no seizure history. He regained consciousness after about 45 seconds to a minute. The patient was not treated for the events. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19. The clinical outcome of passed out was resolved on 23Apr2021, while of seizure, lightheaded, fell out of chair and hit floor, making a gurgling/growling sound, his right arm was contracted and tight was resolving.

                                                Child woke up at 3 am with severe nausea. Within minutes he complained about not being able to breathe. His lips turned blue and he was about to pass out. As I was able to keep him awake, I am not sure whether he would have had a febrile seizure (it very much looked like it) or just fainted. The fever spike was too fast, and his body couldn&#39;t handle it. His extreme nausea persisted for four hours (but he didn&#39;t vomit). He was completely debilitated. Fever spiked to 103 but stabilized at 102 for the following 24 hrs.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post vaccine, mom alerts the pharmacist that patient is experience some visual disturbances. The patient states that he felt dizzy/eyes were &#34;going black&#34; in and out. Heavier breathing than normal. States it feels harder to breath, but no reports of swelling or itching. Also states that ears were ringing. Pharmacist attempted to check blood pressure on patients left arm with an automatic cuff, but the machine errored twice. Then attempted to check BP with a manual cuff. Reading was varied due to patient moving his arm and hard to hear. Seemed to be around 90/50, but not precise. After 10 minutes, patient stated he was starting to feel better, just felt thirsty. Pharmacist rechecked BP on right arm with a different automatic cuff and reading was 104/62, with a pulse of 101. Patient continued to improve, stating that visual disturbances were gone and hearing had returned to normal. Was able to stand and walk around without feeling dizzy. No difficulty breathing reported at that time. Patient and mom waited another 5 minutes to ensure he had no symptoms and then were able to leave approximately 25 minutes post vaccine.

                                                Immediately after injection Patient began to faint and clench his arms. His head tilted back and eyes were glazed over. Lips became pale and face was pale. He was clammy to the touch on the back of his neck. His blood sugar at the time of injection was 113. He had not eaten breakfast yet. This lasted about a minute or so. He was finally able to say that he felt ok, but asked what happened. This happened a second time about 4minutes after the first time. But didn&#39;t seem to last as long. I gave him some juice and saw that his blood sugar was dropping to 85. Then a few minutes later his blood sugar was at 62. He continued to drink the juice and had 3 4carb glucose tablets. He started to feel better about 15 minutes later. He states that he felt numbness in his hands and feet initially. All feelings returned and color to his face and lips. His blood sugar began to rise again and he was feeling better. No hives or rash was noted on his body and the injection site was normal.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old male presenting to hospital as a transfer for chest pain and elevated Troponin levels concerning for myocarditis. Patient has otherwise been healthy. Two days ago he received his second dose of COVID vaccination. He initially felt fine, but later that day had some body aches. The next day he felt feverish off and on and had dull left upper sternal border chest pain intermittently. Today, he reports sharp 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, lightheadedness, sweating, chills, and intermittent non-productive cough. He presented to original hospital for evaluation. The patient admits to tactile warmth since Sunday with no documented temperatures. He recently received his second dose of Pfizer just before onset of these symptoms. He reports difficulty sleeping since Sunday, but no shortness of breath, rashes, syncope, nausea, or vomiting. He has not had any other recent illness, fevers, or known COVID-19 exposures. He denies any history of prior cardiac disease and there is no known family history of cardiac disease, arrhythmias, or sudden death in the child or adolescent period. He denies illicit or recreational drug use. In the ED, he was well appearing with pain now 1 out of 10. POC troponin was 16.8 ng/mL. He had labs pertinent for ESR 10, CRP 3.0, BNP 24. RP2 PCR was negative. UDS was negative except for opiates (s/p morphine). IV was placed and patient was started on IV fluids. EKG was obtained and showed questionable left atrial enlargement per ED read. Cardiology was consulted and performed Echocardiogram in the ED at bedside and was within normal limits. Cardiology resident team contacted for admission. Past Medical History: No major medical diagnoses Past Surgical History: Orchiopexy, T&amp;A Family History: No cardiac family history Social History: Lives at home with mother. Has two healthy siblings not living at home Immunizations: Up to date Medications: None Allergies: NKDA Etiology of likely myocarditis remains unclear at this time. In his age group, this would most likely represent a viral myocarditis. He would likely benefit from cardiac MRI during this admission for further evaluation of myocarditis. His EKG findings with his age group are unlikely to be secondary to myocardial infarct. No arrhythmias or heart block noted on EKG at time of admission or telemetry in ED. There is no family history of autoimmune disease or cardiac disease to suggest an autoimmune component or genetic etiology.

                                                The patient felt dizzy and had blurry vision about 5 minutes after the vaccine administration. I talked to the patient and mother who reported a history of anxiety that may be contributing. They asked if he could lay down in the vaccine room and upon entering he lost his balance and fell to his knees but did not get injured or lose consciousness. The patient said he was not hurt but I called 911. they arrived about 15 minutes later and evaluated the patient. The patient revealed he had ran 2 miles earlier that day and had nothing to eat or drink besides a Yoo-hoo all day. The EMTs said he was very dehydrated. The patient felt fine after another 10 minutes and the mother declined medical transport.

                                                6/3/21 at 1230 pm: Sudden onset of right arm numbness progressing to transient blurry vision, difficulty walking, right lower extremity weakness, difficulty moving his mouth, stuttering,  imbalance, and right sided facial droop.   He was admitted to hospital on 6/4/21. Found to have a demyelinating process (see imaging report below). He received IVIG treatment and IV steroids with some (but incomplet)e improvement and was discharged to Rehab on 6/16/21 on oral steroids. However, he had recurrence and progression of symptoms and was sent back to hospital on 6/19/21 with worsening right sided hemiplegia. He underwent repeat high dose IV steroids and initiation of plasmapharesis. He has currently (as of 6/25/21) completed 3 of 5 runs of plasmapharesis with marked improvement in symptoms but still has significant right sided motor deficits.   Neurologists here now feel comfortable making a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. He will likely be discharging home for ongoing therapy and treatment after he completes plasmapharesis  on 6/28/21.

Patient was getting restless and started asking to leave ~13 minutes after shot. I said ?no, we need to wait the full 15 minutes they recommend?. About on minute later, or ~14 minutes after shot, Patient said he felt like he was going to pass out. As I turned my head to look at him to began to slump towards me unconscious and I held him up by his shoulder and waved the paramedics over. He was unconscious with eyes closed for about 5 seconds and by the time the paramedics got there his eyes were fluttering, but he remained unresponsive for another ~10-15 seconds as they were calling his name, tapping his shoulder, and asking him questions. Then he finally came around and, while groggy, he was able to answer questions. He sat there a couple minutes talking to paramedics and they had wheelchair, but he said he could walk and got up slowly to walk slowly back to clinic area.

Within  seconds, his head fell back and his eye had rolled to the back of his head.  The patient was caught by the administering pharmacist and asked for assistance.  The patient was placed on his back and allowed to gradually get his bearings.  The patient&#39;s mom states he has experienced fainting following or during other medical treatments since the age of 6.   The patient was given water, and after about 30 minutes felt well enough to leave the store with his mom.

Patient was already alert and had gotten up himself when pharmacy staff came to assist patient.  He said he was fine and did not need further medical care.  Patient mentioned he has not gotten a vaccine in a long time and was probably nervous. He finished the rest of his 15 mins observation time (with mom waiting with him) and was feeling good to go home.

                                                A few minutes after patient received dose this morning around 9:20am, he became pale, developed hot flashes, shaking, nausea, dizziness, and hands feeling numb/tingling. Provided the patient with a cold pack for the back of his neck and water to drink, and encouraged him to sit with his head lowered. The patient&#39;s father pointed out that he had not had anything to eat that morning, which could have contributed to his response. After a few minutes, most of the symptoms abated, and patient was feeling much better. His father left the store with him at that time. Called the father later that day, and he said patient was feeling better. Had taken nap and was only feeling a little tired. I explained possible side effects from vaccine and father thanked me for our time and concern.

                                                Patient walked into the observation area around 5:16pm after his vaccination. He was with his stepfather. He was with normal mentation, walking on his own, and talking with his stepfather in the waiting room. Within 1-2 minutes in the waiting room, he leaned to the right in his chair, hit the glass (glass did not crack or shatter, no head injury), and was not responsive for about 5 seconds. His father called his name and grabbed his hand but no response. I rushed over and patient became responsive and endorses not remembering what happened.  He does not remember the event. No body shaking, tongue biting, or incontinence.  He was taken back to the vital room, and his first BP was 70/35, pulse in the 60s. He denied any symptoms, and physical exam including neurological exam were normal. He was speaking coherently and with good mentation.  He was given a water to drink. Repeat blood pressure 5 minutes later improved to 96/59 with no medication.  He was moved to a clinic room and was laid supine with his legs elevated.  Orthostatic blood pressures were within normal limits (111/63 supine, 110/72 sitting, 109/69 standing). Patient was able to walk out on his own and was in normal mentation.  No medications were given or interventions wee done.

                                                Patient received vaccine and came and sat down next to his father in the waiting area.  Approximately 5 minutes after sitting down he fainted and fell out of chair.  His father guided his fall.  It took 2-3 minutes for patient to gain conscientiousness.  He was disoriented, pale, groggy.  911 was called and arrived approximately 20 minutes after event.  After the paramedics examined patient, he regained his bearings and color.  The family decided to go home at approximately 10am.  I spoke with mother at 7pm tonight and patient has been fine all day.

EMT pulled him off the floor and took him to the ambulance.

Pharmacy staff came to his side and gave him wet, cold compresses and water.  He was feeling dizzy and clamy but never lost consciousness.  The pharmacist could see that the patient was wearing a CGM.  The patient was able to see his blood glucose levels on his receiver and they were high.  We were able to rule out hypoglycemia.  The patient threw up three times in the waste basket.  After about 20-30 minutes he started feeling better.

                                                Pt was seen at ED on5/8 for L sided weakness in the setting of a headache. Pt?s mother reports that these symptoms began 2 days after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in R deltoid. She says that on 5/6, pt complained of L arm weakness during cooking class at school, which was followed by a mild L sided headache later in the day. Symptoms resolved without intervention but recurred on 5/8 with associated L sided facial droop, slurred speech, L arm spasms, and L foot drag.  Pt was seen at  ED for this and had a HA (5/10 in severity) at that time -- workup was unremarkable with a normal head CT, laboratory workup, and resolution of symptoms. Pediatric Neurology evaluated the pt, deemed no further workup necessary, and advised outpatient follow up.   Pt presented again to the ED on 5/10 with concern for full tonic/clonic seizure, witnessed by pt?s mother. Mother reports that she heard pt fall and went upstairs to find pt seizing on his bed -- says that pt had shaking of bilateral upper extremities (in flexed position close to chest) and symmetric lower extremity shaking; eyes were closed without clear focality or eye deviation. Also some drooling, though no incontinence or tongue biting. Episode lasted for approximately 2 minutes; pt was confused and did not recall what happened immediately afterwards but improved within the next 8 minutes. He was taken to the ED by EMS.   By the time he arrived in the ED, he had left sided weakness again. He was given Keppra 1g, placed on EEG, and was admitted. EEG overnight was read &#34;normal&#34; and additional workup was unremarkable. Pt had MRI brain completed showing cortical abnormalities in the R parietal lobe, suspected to be related to recent seizure. MRA showed patent intracranial cerebral vasculature. MRV showed no evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis. Weakness resolved by the morning and pt was back to baseline on morning of 5/11/21. However, around 9 AM, L sided weakness (face, arm&gt;leg) with associated headache recurred. Mom says that this event was captured on EEG. He was then transferred to our facility. He was placed on pEEG and had repeat labs, imaging completed. Pt did have L sided facial droop, L arm weakness, and slurred speech on arrival, but this resolved within 24 hours. Pt had one additional episode of &#34;wave&#34; of L sided weakness including L sided facial droop and slurred speech at one other time during the hospitalization, but no additional seizure like activity. He was discharged on 5/14 with a normal neuro exam-- some labs (including labs of Rheum and Id workup were pending at time of discharge.) Primary and consulting teams elected to forgo steroids but reconsider should symptoms worsen or return. Pt was readmitted on 5/16-- had an episode of expressive aphasia &#43; headache while at a social gathering; states that he became overwhelmed by the noise. No additional seizure like activity.

Mom caught him and called for help and reported his eyeballs rolled up and he started down when she caught him. by time Pharmacist and store staff got there (less than a minute) he had regained consciousness but very lightheaded. No breathing difficulty. So got a chair and had him sit with head down and store staff observing. After another 10min he still reported lightheaded and nausea, so ambulance was called. When they arrived and checked him out everything checked out normal and he was feeling better so they released him to his parents care. Called on 5/24/21 at 10:10am and spoke to mom who reported he was doing fine and no apparent after effects.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine in the morning, then woke at about midnight. He went to get a drink of water, and was holding a glass of water in his hand. He started to feel as if the room was spinning, became very sweaty, had ringing in both ears, and lost consciousness, striking his head on the counter. The event was unwitnessed. He reports waking approximately 1 hour later with a bad headache. He had a headache and felt disoriented. He denies urinary/bowel incontinence or tongue biting. He was able to walk back to his room without difficulty, took ibuprofen, and went back to sleep. He woke the next morning with nausea and vomited, but this did not impact his headache. He has not had any notable neurologic symptoms since that time, but continues to have a minor headache. He has not had any further vomiting. Headache has not subsequently woken him from sleep and does not worsen with recumbent positioning. He denies visual changes, memory changes, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, ringing in his ears, or dizziness. He says his headache is located mostly around his forehead and at the top of his head that is now mild and feels like pressure ?like a tension type headache.? His mother is a nurse, and evaluated him the next day. The family did not feel that he needed to be seen in the emergency department, or prior to this visit. He has not had any previous episodes that were similar. Patient was evaluated in my clinic. Complete neurologic exam was within normal limits. He has been referred to neurology for further assessment.

A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm, at age 17 years, on 12Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pressure in his eye from an injury, asthma (diagnosed when the patient was about 2) and has family members with asthma and heart conditions. Patient is in perfect health, he works out 6 days a week, and does football conditioning 5 days a week. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Concomitant medication included timolol taken for pressure in his eye from an injury from an unspecified start date to 20May2021. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. The patient historically received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number: EP7534) at the left arm at age 17 years on 22Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient got his second dose of the vaccine on 12Apr2021 and shorty after on 19Apr2021, he became very fatigued, very weak, his chest hurt, and he had shortness of breath. On Apr2021, patient had dizziness. The patient used to have bulky arms and now you can see his muscle mass depleting in Apr2021. The patient cannot focus on school online because of the headaches from 19Apr2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure goes up and down from 19Apr2021. For days from 19Apr2021, the patient&#39;s heart rate will be fine in the 60s and it goes up to 120 or 130 with chest pain, it fluctuates depending on the day.  The patient visited the emergency room on 05May2021, but was not admitted and no one knows what was going on with the vaccine. It was also reported that the patient lost 14 pounds on 25Apr2021 since the second dose of the vaccine. They knew the patient has already lost 10 pounds and then yesterday, 25May2021, the patient weighed himself and noticed he has lost another 4 pounds over the weekend. Patient had bloodwork on 20May2021 and it was all negative. The primary care provider was concerned about the weight loss so she ran a bunch of blood work. The patient is negative for COVID test and chest x-ray on 21May2021 and he has had multiple tests done. The patient went to his primary care provider on 25May2021 (yesterday from the time off reporting) and the reporter mentioned that maybe can they look at this as being a side effect from the vaccine. The patient&#39;s doctor laughed and said nothing has been proven yet about this. The reporter felt that this is a reaction to the vaccine. At the time of reporting on 26May2021, the patient was not able to function and sleeps all day. The patient also underwent lab tests and procedures that includes being tested negative for mono twice now (on unspecified dates). Clarified that they have not filed a safety report with Pfizer on the patient&#39;s events. The outcome of the events &#39;dizziness&#39;, &#39;lost 14 pounds since the second dose of the vaccine/lost another 4 pounds over the weekend&#39;, &#39;muscle mass depleting&#39;, &#39;cannot focus on school online&#39;, &#39;not able to function&#39; and &#39;sleeps all day&#39; was unknown; while for the other events, it was not recovered.

I took the patient sat on the chair in the lobby and tried to clean his opened wound on the eye brown. We gave him drink some water and he felt tired and light dizziness.After 20 minutes, 911 came and checked his pulse, oxygen, and clean his wound. After 30 minutes, patient felt okay and no longer having dizziness and he refused to go to Emergency. He still had pain from hurting eye brown.

Patient appeared to have seizure like activity and paramedic called immediately. After 1 to 2 minutes patient started responded well and just stated she felt very faint. Paramedics arrived and waiting for patient to fully recovered. They did state her blood pressure decreased to below baseline but quickly came back up to normal as patient started feeling better. They deemed patient to be stable and didn&#39;t think it was from the vaccine itself versus receiving an injectable vaccine as patient often feels faint after giving blood. They walked patient and grandmother to their personal car so she coudl be taken home.

I ran over to make sure the patient was alert and he tried to stand up after falling so we escorted him to a chair and called 911. I waited with the patient until the fire department arrived, the patient was sweating, pale, and seemed to be breathing normally.

                                                Patient is a 17 year old male with only past medical history of anemia at 1 year of age (resolved with iron and vit C supplementation), who presented to an Hospital on 7/7/21 with 2 days of chest pain radiating to his L arm, generalized upper extremity weakness, SOB, vomiting, found to have an an elevated troponin level of 0.626 with ST segment elevation on EKG, echo reportedly normal.   Patient reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 on 6/6  and subsequently went into quarantine, was re-tested on 6/21 and tested negative.  He arrived on 6/28 and received his 1st dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 07/03/21.  Of note, he was told he might feel dizziness and arm achiness after the vaccine but denies he was informed about possible inflammation of or around the heart after the vaccine.  On 7/5 he was awakened in the morning by chest pain 6/10 and shortness of breath that started in the right lower sternal border and progressively moved to the left lower sternal border and then to his L shoulder and arm which he describes as feeling like he had been &#34;punched&#34; or a constant achy feeling.  He took Tylenol x1 on Monday with minimal improvement.  He initially thought it was reflux pain and took tums but it did not improve.  He had one hour of relief but then the pain returned.  He reportedly felt dizzy Monday evening as well.  The pain was absent on Tuesday, but he woke up this morning again with the same chest pain and shortness of breath, prompting him to seek medical attention.  In the outside ED, he had one NBNB emesis that was not preceded by nausea.  En route from Hospital to Hospital he complained of chest pain 7/10 for which he was placed on 2L O2 which reduced the pain to 4/10.  During his admission his troponin levels initially up trended and peaked at 5.67 before beginning to downtrend.  He was diagnosed with myopericarditis and started on ibuprofen three times a day around the clock. He was discharged home on 7/8 with specific return precautions, follow-up appointment with cardiology, and strict instructions to avoid exercising and strenuous exercising until cleared by cardiology.

At further inspection I noticed that he was having a rash . I had a sit for a few more minutes then his mom came up and we noticed that his arm started to swell. We gave him 2 capsules Benadryl 25mg and instructed him to go to urgent care. Called for a follow up later in the evening and found that urgent care send him to the ER. The rash was spread all over and well as the swelling. He swelled all the way to his toes. He also tuned white and became very lightheaded at the ER. They gave him IV Benadryl and dexamethasone and was sent home. It has been recommended by the ER doctors to not get the 2nd dose.

                                                Patient was nervous about getting vaccine. Discussed safety profile of vaccine and that many people are tolerating very well. Patient seemed much better after discussion and was ready to get vaccine.  Gave injection and he was doing fine and went to sit down for 30 minutes as recommended. After giving next vaccine about 15 minutes later patient apparently tried to come across waiting room to speak to me and started to fall. Next patient was leaving room and caught patient, preventing injury and called for help.  Multiple staff responded.  Patient reported dizziness and seeing colors.  Was breathing fast but not having any swelling or trouble breathing. Was able to stand after a minute and was taken to clinic that is right next to pharmacy for evaluation. Patient was evaluated and left within the next hour doing well.  Spoke to patient in the afternoon and reports recovering well, has a headache that he thinks is stress related.  Counseled to continue to monitor and seek medical attention if any worsening of symptoms.

                                                My healthy 18-year old son had his first dose of Pfizer, and within a few minutes he felt dizzy. His heart rate was also rapid. He didn&#39;t think much of it, but the dizziness persisted and so they had him lay down with feet up. After about 20 minutes, he began to vigorously shake (rigors I believe is what it is called.) He felt numb in both arms and also his tongue and mouth. We had 3 nurses attending to him, and after about 30 minutes they decided to send him to the ER for evaluation since the very strong shaking and other symptoms were worsening. The shaking, dizziness, numbness all subsided after about an hour. He was given a Zyrtec upon first symptoms about 15 minutes after dose. The ER doc doesn&#39;t believe it was an allergic reaction but potentially a strong vasovagal response and immune response. He felt tired after but was completely fine 2 hours later. We were discharged from the ER a few hours later after evaluation. Vitals were in normal range including blood sugar, blood pressure and oxygen. He was fully hydrated prior and had a turkey sandwich and orange prior to coming so was not low on food either. The shaking was very extreme and concerning. It has been almost 24 hours and he is feeling fine other than a sore arm.

                                                A nurse in observation was made aware of a patient feeling faint around 1430. This nurse responded to this patient. She stated patient looked gray and said his oxygen saturation was 78%. His blood pressure was 88/60. She poured cold water on his chest, thinking he could be overheated. She instructed another nurse to call 911.  A call went out over the walkie-talkie for a Charge Nurse to come to the scene at 1440. At this time the other nurse was already on the phone with EMS. When I arrived to patient around 1441, patient&#39;s oxygen saturation was 99% and pulse was 80. He was pale. He was talking coherently. He stated he had not eaten all day. I gave him some hard candy to suck on.  Around 1445, EMS arrived. They assessed him and determined he did not need additional care.  He signed EMS forms and the patient&#39;s brother drove him home. Patient was advised to make sure he did not go a whole day without eating before getting his second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Patient received the COVID-19 vaccine (first dose Pfizer). He reported no previous adverse reactions to vaccines. During the 15 minute monitoring period, the patient fainted. He appeared pale and sweaty, and he reported dizziness, lightheadness, and blacking out. He laid down for several minutes and sat up in the chair with assistance when he was no longer lightheaded. His blood pressure was 108/71 with heart rate 76.  EMS checked the patient and cleared him approximately 20-25 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm at the age of 18-year-old on 07Apr2021 09:50 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing congenital diaphragmatic hernia (that prevented his lungs from developing before he was born). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (FLU) for immunization and without a reaction. Caller is a consumer, calling about his 18 years son who received the covid vaccine this morning and had an adverse event afterwards. Caller reported that his 18 years son had his first covid vaccine dose this morning. He has had all of his vaccinations, even the flu shot every year without a reaction. After having his covid vaccination, on the way home he said he started feeling light headed. He was supposed to go back to school once they got home but the caller noticed that his son hadn&#39;t left yet because he drives himself. He reported that his son&#39;s room is downstairs and when he looked his son was laying down at the bottom of the stairs and appears to have passed out. He reports that now he is fine and he has eaten. Calling now because he was concerned and &#34;wanted to make sure there was nothing else I should do in this situation&#39;&#39;. Caller stated that he took his two kids to get their vaccines. His son is 18 years old and his daughter will be 18 next Tuesday.Stated that they stayed at the site in case of a reaction to the vaccine and nothing happened. On the way back home the son became lightheaded. Caller thought maybe he needed to eat even though he had eaten a light breakfast before they went to get the vaccines. Stated his son got home and passed out. Caller had never seen his son pass out before. Said his son fell down the stairs while going to the basement where is room is located. Caller was concerned this could&#39;ve been a reaction and is calling to see if there is anything further they should be concerned about. The son&#39;s vaccine, lightheadedness, passing out, and falling all took placed today 07Apr2021. Caller said he nor his son are certain if he was injured during the fall. His son thinks he hit his head and his knee and noticed that his shorts where ripped behind the leg on 07Apr2021.  Caller states his son says he is feeling back to normal and fine. The son was supposed to go to school after the vaccine but the caller had him stay home so he could keep an eye on him. Caller stated it was scary. The caller opened the door and saw his son lying on the floor with the gum he had bought at the drug store strewn out everywhere. Caller stated they are believers in vaccines. Stated his son used to have a part time job at the grocery store bagging groceries for customers and was wanting to go back to work. Caller also said that his son was born with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia that prevented his lungs from developing before he was born. Caller stated that due to this him and his wife felt it was best for the son to get the vaccine since if he got the Covid virus it could have been really bad for him. Caller denies any medications, labs, testing or treatments that are relevant to these events. Caller stated his son is healthy. Stated when his son mentioned being lightheaded in the car, the caller didn&#39;t think much of it. The outcome of events was recovered on 07Apr2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He went to stand up and then blacked out, falling to the floor. He did not injure himself or experience any trauma in the fall. He did not lose consciousness. I believe he was experiencing increased anxiety from the event as the patient mentioned several times that he did not like needles/injections. The patient remained sitting upright for an additional 15 minutes, drinking water, and his mother escorted him out of the store and drove him home.

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Apr2021 at 12:45 (Lot Number: Ew0153) at the age of 18 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included autism spectrum disorder, ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) combined, learning disabilities. The patient had no known allergies. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medication taken within two weeks of vaccination included alfetamine aspartate/alfetamine sulfate/dexamphetamine saccharate/dexamphetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for an unspecified indication. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 in left arm, on 02Apr2021, lot # EK5730. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Apr2021 at 21:00 the patient experienced extreme hallucinations, not feeling well, chills, aches and pains, headaches, slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, he did not get much sleep, fever. The clinical course of events was reported as follows: My son reported to me at bedtime last night, the night of his second Pfizer vaccine dose, that he was not feeling well. I told him to take some Advil and go to bed. He had a very bad night with chills and aches and pains but most distressing was his description of having had extreme hallucinations. He said that he was aware they were hallucinations and not real during and after the experience, but it was nonetheless concerning. It is also concerning that he didn&#39;t wake me for help. At any rate, he did not get much sleep and I have to assume his fever went pretty high before morning. He described to me the need to hydrate during the night. He also relayed to me this morning an experience of headaches and slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, but he is now feeling much better. He is dressed, has eaten, and is playing games on the computer. I am keeping a close eye on him today and should we return to that level of concern, we will take him to urgent care.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

An 18-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EW0169) at single dose, on 22Apr2021 at 17:30, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. Patient&#39;s mother reported that her son fainted within 30 seconds of receiving the Pfizer vaccine 1st dose and since then he had experienced some intermittent light headedness and dizziness. He passed out completely after shot. Adverse events were described as following: &#34;patient is due to get his second dose of the shot later this evening but is having periods of lightheadedness and dizziness. Patient&#39;s mother states that her son also feels like he is going to pass out. She states that this started 30 seconds after the first shot. Her son only passed out once, completely right after the shot, it was a bad experience. She&#39;s glad he actually wants the other one today, but he is concerned because he is still lightheaded and dizzy after 3 weeks. Patient&#39;s mother states that he has been trying to function, work, and live his life but its irritating to him and scary. The doctor suggested that he should get his second dose but her son is a little fearful&#34;. Physician Office Visit required. The patient did not recover from intermittent light headedness and dizziness, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile and strong temporal relationship there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the reported events and the suspect drug.

ALMOST 5 MINUTES AFTER THE VACCINATION, THE PATIENT WAS SLOUCHED IN HIS CHAIR, SWEATING, LOOKING PALE, AND COMPLAINING THAT HIS BODY WAS HURTING ALL OVER. I RAN OVER TO THE PATIENT AND ASKED IF HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING, TO WHICH HE DENIED. I BEGAN TO ASK HIM WHERE EXACTLY DOES IT HURT TO WHICH HE MENTIONED HIS LEGS AND BODY.  SINCE HIS BREATHING WAS FINE, I SUSPECTED IT WAS JUST A PANIC ATTACK BUT NONETHELESS I PROVIDED HIM AN ICE PACK AND WATER. WE ALSO MOVED HIM TO A MORE PRIVATE AREA TO ELEVATE HIS LEGS. I OFFERED TO CALL 911, BUT HE DENIED. WE KEPT HIM FOR 30 MORE MINUTES WATCHING OVER HIM TO SEE HOW HE PROGRESSED. HE FELT MUCH BETTER TOWARDS THE END. THE PATIENT ADMITTED HE WAS HAVING A PANIC ATTACK. MY TECHNICIAN OFFERED TO CALL A FAMILY MEMBER TO COME GET HIM, BUT HE DENIED AND SAID HE WAS OKAY TO DRIVE HIMSELF HOME.

He and his mother went to the restroom where she helped him to the floor so he did not fall. He reports not remembering walking to the bathroom, and was woozy when I (the pharmacist) arrived to the restroom. His breathing was elevated, and he was pale in color. No emergency medication was administered . Paramedics arrived to check him out, and he left the store under his own power.   The vaccine-administering technician reported that he seemed very nervous to receive the vaccine today. When I was talking to him in the restroom he admitted that he has a history of anxiety/panic attacks when receiving vaccines in the past.

                                                Patient received vaccine around 5 pm. For the first two minutes after vaccination the patient seemed to be fine. Starting around that 3rd minute the patient got very dizzy and nauseous. He was then seated to prevent further NV. I asked the patient if they were breathing ok and the patient stated his breathing was fine. After about another minute the patient&#39;s eyes got glossy and the patient seemed to be out of it. I asked multiple orienting questions such as his name, where he was, and what day of the week it is. He was only able to answer the day of the week and his head was bobbing. I then called 911 as the patient became very pale and started to profusely sweat. While on the phone with the 911 operator, the patient went completely unconscious and lost control of motor functions. I was able to confirm the patient was still breathing and still had a heart rate (although rapid) and thus compressions were not given. The EMT arrived quickly to the scene and took over care of the patient. After about 20 minutes of checking vital signs, the EMT gave the patient and his family the option on whether they want to go to the hospital or not for further examination. The family decided they wanted to take the ambulance to the hospital.

                                                After receiving vaccine  patient stated they did not feel well (complained of nausea/light headedness), before I could ask if the patient was okay the patients entire body stiffened, his eyes got very big/wide, and they started to roll back. At that point I stayed with the patient and called for my pharmacist. The patient lost consciousness, and by the time my pharmacist got there he was stable and coherent. Once my pharmacist assessed the situation she had me call 911 for paramedics.  We had him lay on the floor with a pillow under his head, feet elevated.  We provided ice water, nuts as a snack, and I dabbed sweat from his forehead while holding an ice pack to his forehead. I stayed with the patient and patients girlfriend until paramedics arrived for transport.

                                                Allergy to red meat became prevalent again. Since becoming allergic to red meat in the summer of 2020, I had gained a tolerance to red meat to the point where I could consume as much as I wanted. This lasted between August 2020 and the date listed in this report. On that date I consumed red meat and had an allergic reaction to it. The reaction was a swelling of the fingers, hives on the arms and knees and wrist. As I didn?t have any reactions to red meat in the previous 10 months I didn?t make the connection that I was allergic to red meat again. The following Monday I consumed more red meat. That night I was very drowsy and went to bed at 1900. At around 0100 Tuesday morning I woke up with a terrible stomach ache and could feel my hands itching. I tried to go back to sleep. At around 0430 I woke up again with completely swollen hands to the point where I couldn?t bend any joint in them, hives on my wrists, knees, elbows, neck, forehead, back, and back of thighs. I went to the hospital for a severe allergic reaction. This is the exact same allergic reaction that I would have when I consumed red meat in June 2020 at the height of my allergy, but I had never had a reaction like it since then. Now I am sensitive to red meat again and I can?t think of any reason except that I received the vaccine. I have not consumed red meat since.

The next day (08JUN2021 @10AM) my son came down from his room to eat breakfast and still was not feeling the best but seemed fine after eating.   Around 12PM my son came down the stairs to get some water in the kitchen and then shortly thereafter after passed out, fell against the wall and slid down to the floor.  I was in the location and found him unresponsive, very cold, and eyes looking straight ahead -not moving.       My older son and I then carried him to the couch where I laid him down and elevated his feet. He started coming around approx. two minutes later and broke out in a sweat but also had chills.  At that point, I did not call an ambulance and started to hydrate. After an hour or so, he started feeling better and then ate some food but was weak most of day and rested.  The next day he seemed fine.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

                                                Pfizer shot given.  Patient felt ok immediately after shot, but approximately 5 minutes later told his mom he felt weird.  He passed out and was helped to a sitting position.  When I was called out to the lobby patient was still feeling a little lightheaded but he was conscious and breathing normally.  He sustained a small cut on his hand which we cleaned up promptly.  Patient told mom he felt like his vision was  blurry.  Mom wanted him checked out so I called emergency help.

                                                Patient was sitting in post-vaccination waiting area in front of the pharmacy and fell off his chair.  He regained consciousness right away and didn&#39;t remember passing out.  I asked him to recline and elevate his legs and he held that position for several minutes and then seemed fine after that.  He said he has an extreme fear of needles and felt he passed out from the anxiety he was feeling prior to getting the shot.  He remained in the post-vaccine waiting area for an additional 15-20 minutes and did not have another episode of syncope.

He did say that he thought he lost consciousness at some point because he ?woke up with everyone standing over him?. When he fell he was diaphoretic and pale- I asked him if he was a diabetic and he states yes. He said he ate before coming and took ?8 units of insulin?. He also said his BG was 121 prior to eating- finger stick done at 1549- and was 88; which he states ?is not low for me?.  Doctor out to assess him and advised he needed to be evaluated by ER. The ambulance was called for him and his mother was notified.  While waiting for EMS he had trouble keeping his eyes open and his eyelids were fluttering, c/o his head hurting and being tired, he continuously yawned and rolled his tongue asking for water. 1559 EMS arrived and took over care of patient at this time.

                                                Dose received at 6:05PM. Patient was seated in waiting area and around 6:10PM a loud noise was made due to metal chairs moving in the waiting area; upon turning around patient was face down on the floor with his head turned to one side. I ran to offer assistance and cushioned his head with my hands. EMS was dispatched immediately. Patient was already starting to come to after losing consciousness for approximately 10-15 seconds, looked confused for about 15 seconds and then seemed to return to a normal mental state immediately after. He was able to give his name and info and knew exactly where he was, etc. and he stated he felt much better. He was able to confirm he hit the side of his head on the floor, however it was not bleeding. I asked if he wanted me to call anyone for him but refused the offer. His blood pressure was taken at 6:15PM by us then again when EMS arrived at approximately 6:20PM and was 140/100. He was checked out by EMS, including a blood glucose reading of 81 and seemed to be okay. They offered to take him via ambulance to the hospital, especially given him hitting his head, but he refused the offer. He explained a similar incident occurred when he received IV contrast dye in the past. He was able to sit up and then stand up without any issues. He continued to wait in the waiting area for about 10 more minutes before leaving to ensure he felt back to normal. I followed up with him at 8:20PM via telephone and he stated he was feeling normal and had no questions/concerns. I assured him he could reach back out to me personally or the store here if he had any questions/concerns in the future.

                                                had absence seizure within 5 hours of vaccination, the next day he started to have more myoclonic twitches.  On April 27th morning he started having severe involuntary head shaking like &#34;no&#34; severe along with arms flailing causing shoulder dislocations, with arms flailing also accidentally punched own nose.  The head shaking lasted all day through bed time despite normal doses of clonazepam 1mg given.   At 1:15 a.m.  had a tonic clonic seizure which was different than his &#34;usual&#34; ones.  This morning he just woke up at 0715 and has started with the head/shoulder twitches.  Yesterday his gait was much more unsteady than usual as well.   Our entire family had the vaccine same day and we all only had mild side effects, brother and sister also have complex medical.  Thank you for all you do.

The physician reported similar events for two patients, this is the first of two reports.   A 20-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration at 20 years old on 17Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on an unspecified date for covid-19 immunization. Caller reported that he had a patient who received his Pfizer vaccine, second dose last Saturday (17Apr2021). He reported that on Monday (19Apr2021) he continued to experience arm pain followed by difficulty moving his arm. Now he was requiring a sling, had been prescribed Toradol and Steroids but was not doing any better. He was having continued weakness and pain under his shoulder. Caller was asking for documentation or studies that have been done to determine if the vaccine has any relationship with Parson Turner Syndrome (neuritis) and recommendations for management. He asked to speak with a Pfizer Neurologist. Caller reported that the patient was being seen by an orthopedist, MD. Caller was requesting urgent escalation of his inquiry for further investigation into a relationship between the covid vaccine and Parson Turner Syndrome (neuritis). The outcome of the events was unknown.  No Follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021441207 Same reporter/drug/AE, different patient

                                                pt had been give the immunization and asked to wait in the waiting area, about 5 minutes later his sister yelled that they needed help. he had said he felt faint and then passed out falling to the side and out of the chair, she states that she saw him &#34;seize&#34; when he hit the ground, but stated that he did not hit his head. When I came upon him his eyes were open and he was able to answer questions. he stated that he did not have any problems breathing, but felt dizzy. He was very clammy so we took his bp and it was 142/65 pulse 64, gave him an ice pack and had him stay laying down. He sat up after awhile and took a few sips of water but started to feel light headed again so we had him lay back down. His bp went down to 105/58 pulse 61, but then came back up to 136/81 pulse 75 as he was starting to feel better. He started to get more color in his face and feel less clammy so I stayed sitting up. We put him in a chair eventually and the EMTs arrived shortly later. They did and evaluation, but as they were talking about whether or not to take him to the hospital he passed out again. The EMTs said he was probably having some anxiety to needles. He then said that he had passed out giving blood once.  They took him to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Approximately three to four minutes after the second dose, he reported feeling dizzy. A few seconds later he lost consciousness with eyes rolled to the back of his head. He was unresponsive to verbal communication or attempts to shake him awake. He then began grunting and struggling for breath. His body began to shake/convulse and he lost control of his bladder. This lasted about five to ten seconds. He regained consciousness and reported that he felt as if he was &#34;dreaming&#34;. He also reported feeling very hot, and had sweat dripping down his face. Paramedics were called to the scene where his vital signs were checked. All signs including temperature were normal. His first dose on /26/21 had an almost exact reaction, minus losing control of bladder, although that time nobody was around to assist him.

In brief, 20-year-old neurologically normal man with history of asthma now presenting with new onset fever, headache and then status epilepticus. On 5/25 the patient received his second dose of COVID vaccine and then started to have intermittent fevers up to 102.5.  This was associated with malaise, nausea, fever, headache, myalgias.  He came to ED on 5/30 and had IVF, analgesics and a cardiac workup that was unremarkable and was discharged with diagnosis of possible pericarditis/myocarditis.  He then had ongoing worsening headaches and increasing fevers and was unable to get out of his bed, and so his wife called 911 and he came to ED on 6/3.  There he had vomiting and transaminitis and was diagnosed with gastroenteritis treated with flagyl. Headaches progressed and were associated with dizziness; he had HCT read as unremarkable but then while awaiting MRI had convulsion.  He was returned to his room and had two more and thus was intubated, placed on propofol/versed, Keppra, dilantin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir before transfer to UCSF. on 6/5/2021 found to have reduced urine output, and serum creatinine found to be 1.72 and climbed &gt;7 in days later normalized spontaneously with fluid support to 4.26 with continued improvement.  LFTs were also found to be elevated.  Was acutely encephalopathic. Seizures resolved on Keppra treatment though had acute agitation for several days. Slowly returning to neurologic baseline. with AKI and LFTs slowly normalizing.

Upon talking to him, he did not pass out or hit his head but did severely scratch the left side of his cheek to his neck above is collar bone.  I checked his blood pressure and it was 119/79. He initially said he felt very hot and was sweaty, then we gave the patient orange juice as he stated he hadn&#39;t had much to eat, and felt better after drinking the juice. He denied EMS and called his grandmother to come pick him up.

                                                After 5 mins of receiving 1 st Pfizer covid vaccine at 10:55am, pt felt nauseous and dizzy. Pharmacist on duty instructed the patient to lay down facing up and started taking his blood pressure every 3 mins while giving the patient the electrolyte Vitamin drink( similar to Gatorade). His blood pressure and pulse readings were 100/60 (60), 93/51 (54), 104/62(68); 101/68(62), 108/79(67),109/79(67). So his blood pressure and pusle went down  for 1 reading then it went back to his normal reading of 109/79 within 10 mins. After laying down for 15 mins and drinking vitamin drink, pt felt better as his nausea/dizziness went away. He felt okay and left the pharmacy at 11:30am. Pt reported no reactions to any vaccines before. His girlfriend called the dad to report the incident and the dad told her that his twin brother experienced the same reaction earlier today when receiving his covid vaccine at another site. His brother felt fine after 30 mins monitoring

                                                Patient asked to stay seated immediately following vaccination, as he has a needle phobia. Shortly after (roughly 5 minutes), patient said he felt extremely lightheaded and shaky. He accepted a glass of water, but after taking a few sips said his vision was starting to black in and out. 911 was called immediately. EMTs checked that patient&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate, and eventually concluded the patient was okay after giving him more water and a banana to eat.

To treat it they gave me an IV for the pain, then I was prescribed ibuprofen and 2 other meds for the inflammation around my heart.

Blood pressure was fine she said along with O2 levels. Left around 11:25 after I felt able to.   We both think this was likely related to the anxiety about getting the shot itself (I have anxiety in general so it was not paired with a mistrust or anything about the vaccine) and began fainting 7 minutes after getting the vaccine. I was anxious about any possible symptoms and needles/shots/blood draws make me feel uneasy. However, this issue was not present with the first shot.

Symptoms almost completely resolved after that period, occasionally had some very mild joint pain still.*Note after both doses, pain in left arm was more severe than right arm* Starting the night of Jan 22 (fri) started having light leg pain, which carried into the 22nd. Dismissed it as too much walking the next day.Jan 24: leg pain a bit more severe, from a 1-2 to a 2-3. Included joint pain in left knee and ankle. Jan 25: pain in both legs at a 3-4, also mild pain in left arm (1-2) as well as joint pain. Jan 26: pain in left arm more severe, leg pain similar in severe. Very mild pain in right arm starting that evening, though only in upper arm. No joint pain in right arm Jan 27: pain in left arm similar in severity, slight increase in right arm pain, would rate 2-3 in right arm, 3-4 in left arm, 3-4 in legs. Muscle weakness in legs (legs shaking when walking down stairs for example) Jan 28 (Thurs):Symptoms started fading. Arm pain lowered in severity in both arms, as did leg pain. By Saturday all that remained was mild leg pain (1-2 in severity)Since then, leg pain has persisted.  Week of Feb 14, leg pain increased in severity back to a 3-4. Visited the doctor on the 17th and had blood-work done on the 23rd after severity didn&#39;t decrease. Blood-work was normal other than slightly elevated lymphocyte % (50.8%)Visited a specialty medicine doctor on 2/25 and had x-rays done of legs. Results normal. Thought to have developed Achilles tendinitis. Possibly attributed to inflammation in legs, doctor wasn&#39;t sure. Rough quote &#34;could it be from the vaccine, possibly, we just don&#39;t know.&#34; Have been doing stretches since which has helped the leg pain. Starting on March 12, I began to have pain in my left arm again, and ended up getting vertigo that evening. The arm pain persisted on and off from then on out, as well as occasional dizziness, which I treated with Dramamine. I did get an appointment scheduled with a neurologist in May that I still have. On March 25, I began to feel unwell, with a fever, dizziness, and a headache. That worsened into the evening, and I woke up at around 3 am with a high fever, that ended up going to about 103 F, and began vomiting around 4:30am on Friday, which persisted into the evening. On Saturday evening I began to feel better. With that recovery, the constant leg pain and frequent arm pain seemed to be gone, and has yet to return to the degree that it had been prior to that bout of sickness.  I do still occasionally get arm or leg pain, but it&#39;s minor and only lasts about 20-30 minutes at a time.

Patient was being supported by other staff member and mother against the wall due to him not being able to support himself. Patient was semi-conscious but responsive at this time. With the help of this provider, mother and other staff member, patient was gently lowered to floor and laid in supine position, head was supported and assisted with elevating his legs. Shortly after patient responded that he was feeling much better then attempted to try and sit up but started to feel lightheaded and was then assisted with laying back in supine position. Patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure was checked. At 4:45pm pulse was at 38 BPM and then at 4:47 pm 55 BPM and blood pressure at 90/60.  This provider then alerted other staff member to call EMS due to abnormal vital signs. EMS did arrive shortly after and then patient was assessed per EMS. Patient was stabilized and elected to not go to hospital. Patient left with mother to go home at approximately 5:01 pm.

                                                Patient said he felt light-headed after his shot. He was advised to continue sitting in the vaccine area. Since he was feeling light-headed, the immunizing pharmacist told me to get the blood pressure cuff. When I got back, the patient passed out. The pharmacist and I moved the chair from underneath him and he gently put him on the floor. He quickly woke up and the pharmacist began to ask him questions such as his name and where he was to make sure he was ok. He was able to answer those questions fine and we placed him in a chair so he can rest. When he was in the chair, he began to pass out again. He quickly woke up again but wasn&#39;t feeling good. The pharmacist checked his blood pressure and it was low. His temperature was at 93F. The pharmacist continued to stay with him and he made sure that someone else was able to come and pick him up. Once he felt ok, he had the patient go sit in the post-vaccination waiting area until he had his ride pick him up.

                                                started with soreness/stiffness in injection site, which I expected as it was how I reacted with the first shot.  however, I then started experiencing mild dizziness/visual impairment (feeling like my vision was shifting or &#34;glitching&#34;) that started around two hours after the shot, slow onset of sore/achy back muscles that hit peak pain at around 3am, and intense chills/shivers that started around 11pm, getting progressively worse as the night went on. Attempted to stop the chills by wrapping in several blankets, but only continued to feel colder and colder. Despite the chills starting around 11pm, fever did not present itself until around 1am, hitting 99.8°F by 1:30am. It was around this time that I took an ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which did not kick in until around 2:30am. Once the chills stopped, my hands and feet only got hotter, keeping me awake for an additional 2 1/2 hours.

He felt throat tightness made it hard to breath, he had associated lightheadedness, felt anxious, almost like a wheezing sound when breathed in and out in his upper neck. When he stood up, he did feel like he needed to hold onto something to steady himself, had some tunnel vision, improved with sitting down and closing his yes and taking deep breaths. He felt warm at the time, not cold or clammy. His friend said he looked ghostly white, no flushing, no hives, no angioedema. No sense of impending doom. He did take Zyrtec the day that he received the vaccine.   He waited the 15 minutes after vaccine without symptoms, and had walked back to class by the time it started. Between the vaccine and symptoms onset, he denies eating anything, being stung by anything.   He told a friend about his symptoms, and he returned to the hospital via base taxi arrived at ER. Symptoms were still occurring about 60 minutes after vaccination when he arrived at the ER. In the ER, he underwent exam, was given oral Benadryl.  His symptoms of scratchy throat lasted for 2 days afterwards with some associated fatigue, post-nasal drip.  He denies other symptoms. No fevers or chills. Small amount of pain and a ?knot? at the injection site the next day, but minimal according to the paitent.   Denies hives, angioedema, SOB, wheezing, nausea/vomiting, no diarrhea, abdominal pain, nasal pruritus/congestion, ocuarl itching/redness, no syncope.   No h/o vaccine reactions before. No h/o passing out before at all, specifically not to needles, blood draws, or vaccines before.   No h/o venom or drug allergy. He does report a history of apple allergic reaction 1 year previous when eating a raw apple, felt his throat close within 15-30 minutes, no hives or other systemic symptoms. He took oral Benadryl and went to ER. He was given oral Benadryl, no Epipen. He followed up with his PCM regarding possible apple allergy and was told to avoid apples, but was never tested for apple allergy. Since then, when he drinks apple juice, his throat will start hurting, but otherwise, he has avoided raw and cooked allergies. He does report seasonal rhinitis symptoms that are worse in the fall. He takes allegra as needed to treat these symptoms. He is not carrying an Epipen currently

                                                Overnight after shot just typical symptoms, some slight chills and next day just a little tired Day 2 after shot, April 11th.  Chest pain, squeezing in chest. Unusual but manageable and didn?t feel terrible otherwise,maybe slightly tired.  Tried leaning forward to make feel better.  Day 3 and 4 chest pain/heart squeezing continued and was bothersome and, went to Urgent Care this day  April 13th. EKG was a little abnormal and told to follow up with a cardiologist and take Advil.  The heart squeezing feeling continued.  Early morning hours April 14th very sick, excessive shaking (no fever), extreme nausea, faint feeling, dry cough (laying on bathroom floor).  Not much, if any chest pain at the time.  Went to ER.  Not much chest pain during ER visit but nauseous and shaking etc. Test were run.   Told that the symptoms were a delayed reaction to the vaccine and to follow up with a cardiologist because possible abnormal EKG and to take Advil as needed.  Overnight at home, no chest pain but an hour of the shaking and nausea returned but not as bad as before.  Over next couple days the chest pain/squeezing, slightly shakes and  light headedness would come and go and by 4-16 feeling pretty great.  The heart feeling mildly at most in the background but not debilitating.  Starting week of April 20th maybe 4-5 flare ups with chest pain and no pattern but not debilitating.  Could happen at rest.  April 27th bigger flare up more debilitating, had to lie down, heart squeezing  pain and maybe some wheezing when breathed in but not tightness in throat.  Lasted about 30 minutes.  Was just doing schoolwork with friends at the time so not under any physical or emotional stress at the time.  After this from April 20 to May 3rd feeling heart symptom mildly but not debilitating and could resume normal active life.  Had cardiology appt. May 3rd with nurse practitioner.  According to NP the 12 Lead EKG run that day correlated with abnormal EKG from ER.  Normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia Rightward axis Pulmonary disease pattern.  Incomplete right bundle branch block Abnormal ECG.  Given 4 lead heart monitor to wear for a week.  Also ordered a CV CT angiogram coronaries with calcium scoring.  The test could not be scheduled through them until July.  Also told could go on hiking trip out west and to stop and rest if felt pain.  For parents reassurance about hiking trip, had a second opinion over teleconference call with Dr., myocarditis specialist to confirm would be safe on hiking trip. Dr. said he should be good to go.  He said these heart symptoms related to the second vaccine could fade over time.  Hiking trip May 20th to May 30th.  Did fine with exertion and just a few small episodes of the chest pain, light headedness and maybe a little shaking but these were at rest.  Also, 4 lead heart monitor report was good.  Returned from trip May 30th and no chest pain or symptoms for approximately 3 weeks through June 17th.   June 18th went to urgent care for sore throat and ear.  Prescribed amoxycillin.  Took the amoxycillin and one Advil sinus, that evening had a heart squeezing episode return.  This was the first time in almost 3 weeks.  Did not take any more Advil sinus in case that caused the episode. Had another slight episode that evening.  Hiked next day June 19th and fine.  Then felt it slightly again after eating that afternoon of the 19th, also chest did feel a little tight all day.  Then felt it again that evening.  Still taking Amoxycillin as of today.

When the pharmacist went to release him, he was pale, dizzy, and clammy. He stated that he did not feel good. The pharmacist fanned him to cool  him down. She also gave him a wet rag to wipe his forehead. He was given two teaspoonful of Benadryl 12.5mg/ 5ml. The patient stated that he was feeling dizzy and thought he was going to faint. The pharmacy called 911. The patient removed his jacket and mask as he was hot. The EMT arrived and walked him outside* I am not sure what happened after that

                                                Around 10pm, I was suddenly very tired and could not stop yawning. I typically am up until 12-1 most nights so this was out of the ordinary. While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

I went to check in on him at 10:50a at which point he was eating a candy bar and stated he was already feeling better. He stated he has experienced symptoms of low blood sugar before and this was similar to what he had experienced in the past - even though it was worse. He said he was already feeling better, but he wanted to get something else to eat. I told him to stay put till 11a to make sure he wasn&#39;t still dizzy. At 11a, he was still feeling better and we went to grab him a pack of barbecue chips. He stayed till 11:20a and was still doing ok and left. I called him at 1:30p and has still doing ok.

It was most comparable to the dull pain that I felt 1-2 weeks after breaking my arm. I had limited mobility due to the pain and the area around the vaccine hurt to touch. The pain gradually faded away after the first day and was completely gone by the end of the second day.

                                                A few days after being vaccinated, I had experienced dizziness, fainting while at physical therapy. When laid on the table, I noticed I had tightness in my chest, like I couldn&#39;t catch my breath. They took my blood pressure, and It was 136/88 pulse rate of 88. These issues continued to persist. I went to the doctors to discuss the issue with a PA. She took an EKG, and found no abnormalities, although I wasn&#39;t having an episode at the time. I later felt palpitations in my chest. (my heart would race spontaneously at times for no longer than a few seconds.) The PA as well as my Doctor, had confirmed I had high blood pressure.  I began to eat healthier and lose weight in order to change the blood pressure issues. The first appointment, I was 284. The second appointment which was in late April, I was 264, and my blood pressure was in the mid 120&#39;s over upper 70&#39;s, with my pulse rate in the 70&#39;s. The most recent appointment, I became more liberal with my diet and gained weight, weighing 268, but my heart rate continued to lower to a normal point, regardless (low 120&#39;s over 68, Pulse rate in the 60&#39;s.) Dr. and I had discussed possible causes, and I still have a cardiology appointment to follow up with, and we agreed that with the recent notice of myocarditis in vaccinated young adults and kids, it&#39;s a strong possibility the vaccine may have caused my issues, although I am to follow through with the cardiologist to confirm these suspicions.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) and a contactable other healthcare professional. This consumer reported similar events for two patients (twins). This is the first of two reports.  A 22-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 26Apr2021 10:00 (at the age of 22-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included ongoing rare metabolic disorder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735) received at age 22 years, on 05Apr2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. On 26Apr2021, the patient received the second dose of BNT162B2. In the evening of the same day, 26Apr2021, the patient experienced tiredness/fatigue, and headache. In the morning of 27Apr2021, the patient was feeling really crappy and they though it was like the flu and it would pass. In the evening of 27Apr2021, the patient didn&#39;t sleep at all and was uncomfortable all night and pain. On the same day, 27Apr2021, the patient had severe chest pain, chest tightness, and lightheadedness. On 28Apr2021, the pain didn&#39;t go away, and the twins had elevated ST evaluation on the EKG (electrocardiograph). ST evaluation was done by the reporter&#39;s husband who is a retired firefighter emergency medical technician. The reporter decided to take the patient to hospital and said that the other twin had the same symptoms but kept saying his wasn&#39;t as bad as his brother&#39;s because he did not want to go to the hospital. The doctor advised the reporter to bring the other twin. The twins had the same echo cardiogram on 28Apr2021 (unknown results). On 28Apr2021, their troponin levels were elevated, and their cardiac enzymes continued to go up. On the same day, 28Apr2021, the patient had a strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe. It was reported that the twins were hospitalized on 28Apr2021 with myocarditis/pericarditis and inflammation around the heart. Treatment for myocarditis/pericarditis included ibuprofen and colchicine; and Toradol for breakthrough pain. The reporter stated that the twins are two identical males with the same DNA, had the vaccine at the same time, had the reactions at the same length of time, have the same lifestyle and live at the same house. The reporter said it would go a long way if they help her understand the complication. The patient recovered &#34;strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe&#34; on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the event myocarditis and pericarditis/inflammation around the heart was not recovered.  Follow-up (14May2021): New information received from a contactable other healthcare professional includes: reporter details (other hcp added as a new reporter).  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

                                                Patient experienced Myocarditis-like symptoms beginning 05/20/2021, 3 days after Dose 2 vaccination.  See Continuation Page for Item 18 information details. Additional information for Item 18:   Day 1 (5/18) Patient had typical dose 2 reactions of low fever (100-101 degF), headache, soreness at injection site, mild dizziness.  Day 2 (5/19) he felt much better.  On Day 3 (20 May 2021 9:00AM) Patient experienced notable chest pain (level 5-6 on scale of 10) lasting about 30 minutes.  Pain then decreased to level 1-2 for the next several hours.  Patient said this felt exactly like the pain he experienced when he had Myocarditis in Nov 2017, only less severe.  (The 2017 event required 4 days of hospitalization and temporarily left patient with heart failure in one ventricle (Ejection Fraction &lt;40%) although EJ returned to normal after a few months).  patient was seeing his Primary Care Physician on another matter later this same morning (5/20) and mentioned the pain.  PCP listened to his heart and did not note any irregularities. Patient had no additional pain episodes for the next 3 days so we did not worry.  But daily chest pain episodes resumed 5/24, 1 to 3 times a day,  mostly level 1-2, sometimes level 3, typically lasting 30 min to 2 hrs, through 6/3.  From 6/4 and on episodes have been less frequent.   On 5/25 patient contacted his 2017 Cardiologist who ordered a Troponin-I lab.  Labs were done 5/26 and were normal so we were advised to monitor but go to the ER if severe chest pain occurred.  Patient has an office visit scheduled with his Cardiologist July 2.  As of 6/12 (date of report) episodes tend to occur after moderate physical activity but clear after rest.  This pattern is similar to what patient experienced during the first 3 months following his 2017 illness.  Accordingly patient has reduced his physical activity, using chest pain episodes as an indicator of too much activity.  The 2017 illness appeared to be completely resolved after April 2018 with normal ECG, Echo, EJ and no further reports of chest pain even with normal activity levels.  May 20, 2021 was the first time this type of chest pain reoccurred.

                                                The side effects didn&#39;t all occur simultaneously. Friday evening I noticed severe arm soreness. Later Friday night (about 10 hours after getting the vaccine) I developed gradual onset chills, body aches, and fatigue. Saturday I woke up with a severe headache, body aches, fatigue, and fever. The headache became severe by mid-day, with fatigue also worsening throughout the day.  Sunday was more of the same, though I believe the fever started inching down and the headache lessened. What developed Sunday afternoon/evening took me off guard though. I noticed a sudden drop in heart rate, a feeling of pressure and discomfort in the chest, nausea, and shortness of breath with exertion (consistently - not just once). (I&#39;m a long-distance runner, so this is unusual for me.) At first I debated going to the emergency room, but since I&#39;m so young and in otherwise good condition I thought nothing of it. I had similar symptoms the following day, but I avoided exerting myself until all of my symptoms from the vaccine had ended. I felt groggy and fatigued for several additional days, but by Saturday (8 days after getting the first dose of Pfizer) everything had resolved. I also developed swollen lymph nodes, which returned to normal size within about 3 weeks (before swelling again after the second vaccine).  The second dose of the vaccine caused a more sudden and intense reaction, though I never developed chest pain/slow heart rate with it.  Instead I developed sudden onset severe chills, fatigue, and body aches about 9 hours after getting the shot. A fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and sudden onset fever (temperature jumped nearly five degrees in about 90 minutes) quickly followed. My fever stabilized around 102.2 around 3 a.m. that morning, and slowly crept down throughout the afternoon/evening. Overall, with dizziness, body aches, extreme fatigue, etc., this was the sickest I&#39;ve been since I had a severe case of the Flu in high school. The fatigue, shortness of breath, and fast heart rate continued for about a week - getting slightly better each day.

A 22-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: unknown; Expiration Date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 28Jan2021 (22-year-old at the time of vaccination), as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included non-sustained ventricular tachycardia diagnosed at birth, pacemaker and defibrillator. The reporter stated that her son has a serious heart condition, pacemaker/defibrillator- first was in 6th grade, currently on his fourth and drug hypersensitivity states they monitored them both longer than the 15 minutes because they have a history of serious allergic reactions to ACE inhibitors. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient continues taking his low dose aspirin prior to the vaccine but did not take any Tylenol. On 28Jan2021, the patient experienced dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite, chills, body aches, fatigue, and itching. The outcome of all the events was recovered on 29Jan2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

I slept from 3:00pm to around 6:00pm with the same symptoms but managed to eat some soup and kept it down. I slept from 10pm to 12pm the next day 12/10/20. My fatigue and joint pain had somewhat dissipated but I was still experiencing severe nausea and a severe headache. By the end of 12/10/20 around 8pm my joint pain and muscle fatigue had gotten better but the nausea and headache were still there. 12/11/20 I was well enough to drive and receive a covid test.

Severity is moderate. Quality dull pain. Currently involves entire left arm (arm, elbow forearm wrist hand).. Did have some swelling and motor loss, NO CP, SOB or sensory loss, no redness, no injury, no fever, chills, ha, depression sore throat, cough, rash, lymphadenopathy, abd pain, GI distress, no trauma or recent illnesses. 2/21: admitted clinic w/rhabdomyolysis: no preceding workouts, increased activity on ship, back sleeper, no alcohol, no trauma,. nsp: skin intact, no erythema. Mild edema to upper arm around triceps. Mild purple discoloration to dorsum of hand. Palp: TTP about triceps. TTP anterior shoulder. TTP biceps. Able to palpate triceps tendon and biceps tendon. NTTP throughout the rest of hand and forearm. Hand is cooler relative to contralateral side. NTTP cervical spine. ROM: Full passive ROM of the shoulder and elbow with pain. No micromotion pain with any joint in the upper extremity. Painless cervical spine ROM. Motor: 3/5 strength to OP/FPL/2nd FDP, EIP/EPL, 1st and 2nd DIO. 3/5 deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors. Sens: Decreased sensation throughout entirety of forearm and hand distal to the elbow. Above the elbow, sensation is intact. Vasc: 2&#43; radial pulse, symmetric to contralateral side. BCR &lt;3 sec. Hand is cooler than contralateral side. Lab: CRP &lt;5, ESR 4, CK 31,924, PT 14, INR 1.1, D-dimer 0.46, AST 610, ALT 186, Cr 0.94, WBC 6.3 Imaging: Radiographs of the chest, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand demonstrate no fracture. The shoulder is well located. CTA starting at the heart demonstrate no vascular abnormalities. Assessment: unlikely that he has compartment syndrome or a cervical spine pathology. His exam does not localize to one specific innervation or muscle group. His paresthesias and diffuse 3/5 weakness on exam may be related to parsonage turner syndrome (post viral neuritis) versus edema. While he does have a cool hand and mild/moderate edema on exam, his CTA is normal and his exam is very reassuring that this is not compartment syndrome. He likely has rhabdomyolysis based on upper arm swelling in the setting of CK of 31924.   Discharge 2/22/2021: He received a total of 3 liters of IV fluids and was encouraged to drink large amounts of water. Repeat CK levels showed to be down trending as were his AST and ALT enzymes. Plain radiographs of his left arm and shoulder were unremarkable as was CT angiography of his chest. Electrolytes and renal lab work was within normal limits throughout the hospitalization.On the day of discharge, he was tolerating a PO diet, ambulating without difficulty, and hemodynamically stable. LUE w/ minimal swelling, no erythema. TTP over L triceps belly, No TTP over the distal LUE. Somewhat decreased sensation to light touch over distal LUE. 2&#43; radial pulses b/l. LUE ROM somewhat limited 2/2 pain, but intact. ---- to f/u with HCP in 2 weeks, sooner if worse (medical officer)   CK 2/22/21 was down to 14653

A 23-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EN6206) single dose, in the left arm, on 08Mar2021, at 11:45 AM, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had not received any other medications within 2 weeks. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not experienced COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 08Mar2021, at 12:00 PM, 5 minutes after vaccination, the patient became very light-headed. In a few seconds his vision went dark and he passed out. After an unknown amount of time, he became semiconscious and was hyperventilating. While hyperventilating, his eyes were open, but he could not see anything. Once he caught his breath, after about 15 seconds, his vision came back and he lost all awareness of where he was. After about 30 seconds, the patient realized he was in the observation area for the facility and alerted the medical professionals near his vehicle he was sitting in. Medical professionals checked his vitals, which were fine other than an elevated heart rate, and he had a tingling sensation over his body for the next two minutes. In this time, he was unable to form cohesive sentences, and his muscles movements were impeded. It took another 40 minutes to return to a relatively normal state. No treatment was received. The patient recovered from the adverse events. Post the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                About 6 hours post injection, with only a small amount of muscle soreness in the injected arm, I was suddenly very very dizzy. I ran from my living room to my bedroom and got under the sheets, I was very very cold. My whole body was twitching violently, and I had extreme muscle pain. Joints popped like knuckles cracking that I wouldn&#39;t normally be able to pop. This lasted for about 10 minutes very violently and then calmed down over another 10, and I just felt very very feverish. I felt numb all over but I was shivering a little. Moving was very hard and my whole back was very sore, with the injection arm in a little extra pain. Fell asleep until about 7:30 am, woke up still a little feverish. I have had waves of extreme dizziness and muscle aches continuing even to today a couple days later. I am also experiencing a rather persistent headache in the very center of my head, making it hard to think. I lose track of my thoughts and it feels like I can&#39;t focus, this seems to be improving gradually over time. treatment only included extra fluid intake and over the counter pain killers

Response by staff was great: laid me down, brought a cot, regularly checked my heart rate, blood oxygen, and blood pressure until it returned to normal and waited to make sure the symptoms did not return.   Later that night, I started experiencing some of the typical COVID vaccine side effects: sore arm, chills, nausea, and fever-like symptoms; in addition to the symptoms I was warned was possible, I also experienced periods of dizziness and an uncomfortable sense of balance. Three days later, the dizziness and other common symptoms have gone away, but my sense of balance still feels off, although I do not know if related to the vaccine. It?s not so bad that I?m at risk of falling over, but I have a semi-regular feeling of unsteadiness which I cannot explain.

Pharmacists were alerted by the patient&#39;s mother immediately. Patient was sitting upright when initially approached with his head down but since his mother stated he was feeling dizzy and nauseous, we laid flat in the waiting room and called 911. Patient had no rash upon inspection or breathing problems. Patient never lost consciousness and was responsive to questions. Paramedics arrived and sent him to hospital for further observation.

He said it could be something else that was making him feel terrible. He said he had a (telehealth) appointment with a doctor tomorrow (09Apr2021). Caller asked if Pfizer had any data with the second COVID-19 Vaccine for people that had a really delayed immune response with their immune system.

He said he was so weak yesterday, even trying to text for his work was bad.

A 23-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 at 1 pm (around 12:20ish as reported) (Lot Number: FN6206) (at 23-year-old) at single dose in arm right for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history relevant to AEs. The patient stated he is a pretty healthy guy. All day after getting the vaccine he was fine. He got the shot at like 1 came home took a nap, ate some dinner, and was playing XBOX with the boys when this happened. At around 10:30 pm on 29Apr2021 he went to rub, his stomach just above his belly button and it hurt. He said that he read on line that that area is called the pancreas or liver, it has a lot of names for that area when looking online. He stated it&#39;s the left upper abdomen area he felt pain when he pressed on it. It radiated really fast across his abdomen while he was on the phone with mother. The more he pressed the more the pain got sharper, and it radiated right across the abdomen, mainly above belly button not too much in lower abdomen, not much in upper abdomen. It was very sensitive. He didn&#39;t have to press hard to trigger the pain. It was almost like the area was inflamed. It happened really fast and that it was his upper stomach not so much the lower part of his abdomen. He felt dizziness and nauseous and like a silly boy he tried to run to the bathroom. He stated that he fell and fainted. His butt was still a little sore from falling. He said when he woke up, he was sweating like he had been out side all day. He did not recall sweating any time he fainted in the past. The side effects were gone after about ten minutes. He was really light headed and had the crazy sharp pain in abdomen for about ten minutes and then it was gone. He had never had that kind of pain. He was laying on the floor for a couple minutes. He went to get his phone, and then sat back down and was sweating. He still had pain at that time but it only lasted about 10 minutes at most. He was still a little bit sore in some joints which was not unexpected. He confirmed that he had a little bit of sweating, and he fainted a little bit. Since the episode he hasn&#39;t felt any symptoms like that before, he has not had any pain like gastritis but he has had some random gastrointestinal things before. It&#39;s also reported nausea on 29Apr2021. No required to emergency room and physician office. He was on the verge of going to the ER while the pain was there. He was going to go until it stopped and to get checked out. No relevant test. The outcome of the events sore joints, dizziness and butt sore was unknown; for other events was resolved on 29Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Directly after receiving the vaccination the patient felt lightheaded and then &#39;blacked out&#39; for a couple of seconds. He was sitting in a chair and slowly slid down the chair to the floor, but he did not hit his head; his head was supported by the vaccinator. The episode was witnessed and no seizure activity or signs of anaphylaxis were present. Patient appeared to have a short syncopal episode. The patient was placed on the floor with his legs up by me, and the patient states he felt much improved in that position. The patient reports that he did not eat or drink anything that day and that he had been working outside until the time of his vaccination. The patient was given Gatorade here to rehydrate; within a couple minutes the patient states that he felt completely normal. EMS was not called. Patient will follow-up with is PCP and has a ride from his mother who was present during the event.

                                                I got my shot on a Friday afternoon. The following Tuesday afternoon, I was out running sprints with a friend. After a couple, I felt super winded, like I was gonna pass out. This was concerning since I run at least 30 miles a week.   Early the next morning, I woke up with my heart racing and shortness of breath. This persisted for a couple of hours. I woke up with a stiff chest, pain and aches around my body, and struggling to breathe. I went to urgent care and they did an EKG on me that came out abnormal. They referred me to a cardiologist where I got an appointment the next day.   The cardiologist runs another ekg this time it?s worse. She sends me straight to the ER. They run a bunch of tests but nothing is conclusive. I?m released the next evening.   The following Monday I had a checkup with my cardiologist and she referred me to someone she knows at a HCF. My appointment is not until the end of June

Pharmacist monitored patient, noticed patient sitting talking on the phone shortly after vaccine. However, after a couple minutes patient passed out and fell off of chair. After yelling patient&#39;s name he came to and did not lose consciousness again. Patient suffered injury on head with a substantial laceration on forehead above eye. Code white was called and patient was given an ice pack and advised to sit for 30 minutes following incident. Asked patient if he would like us to call 911, he refused. He sat with management while an incident report was filled out and while he didn&#39;t want us to call an ambulance it did seem as though his mom was going to take him to urgent care to have his cut examined.

                                                I am healthy 23 year old male. I have never suffered from any sort of illness or conditions. After massive push by the goverment and incentivization to take the New Covid-19 Vaccines deemed safe , I went ahead and received the Pfizer shot on 05/24/2021. A day after I felt headache and dizziness. This stopped on the third day. Later I would have episodes of blurred vision. That stopped. But what has really affected me and continues to affect me , is that a week after I have developed major difficulty breathing.  I never , ever not even once in my life have suffered from breathing problems. It all started on an afternoon a week after the shot randomly with really fast heart palpitations and after those palpitations stopped I was choking, I could not breathe at all. After this , I am having trouble breathing normally or getting enough air in along with tightness in the chest area. For instance, I struggle with two breaths and then the third I will likely get more air in. I have felt incredible tightness in my chest. There has been nights where I cannot sleep because I am unable to breathe , and feel like I am choking. So , I need to get up and walk around the house to catch my breath.  I am having shortness of breath  and my breathing is not like it used to be. I do not have any fever or any other symptoms , the persisting problem is the tightness and difficulty breathing. I already went to the Pulmonary doctor a couple days ago and underwent testing that are pending.  I do not understand why this happened to me , I am not sure if it is a coincidence or if there is a relation between  me having taken that Pfizer shot . But prior to taking that vaccine I never  once had trouble with  my breathing  and never felt tightness around my chest. This is new to me and it scares me to think this might stay with me forever, whatever it is. I pray it goes away. I am still having trouble . and the fact that in the past I never thought about my breathing because it was normal, and now it is a constant issue throughout  the day,  moments when I can get air and others when it is very difficult. I  am reporting this  to leave a record of this incident because prior to me taking this vaccine , I was in fact a fully healthy person free of any sort of health issues.

Also felt dizzy and fatigue at night. My heart was also beating fast. When I woke up at 10am the symptoms seem to be less intense and better. I didn&#39;t feel hot. However, I still felt weak in my body. At 1pm when I started earing lunch I felt hot, tired and dizzy again, I was really sleepy, didn&#39;t feel like eating, and felt like vomiting. I drank coke soda instead and slept until 4pm and I took another 200mg ibuprofen pill with water, after which I felt better.

                                                Immunization prep and administration were normal per protocol with no issues. Approximately 5 minutes after exiting the immunization room the patient approached the consultation window and stated he felt as if he were going to pass out. The pharmacist asked the patient to stay where he was and attempted to run around to the waiting area to help him sit. Before the pharmacist could make it to the patient he collapsed. The patient was in a seated position slumped against the wall, very pale, and profusely sweating. Pharmacist helped him to sit up straight and the patient started responding to questions. Other team members alerted EMS and got a water bottle for the patient. We moved him up to a chair and to the immunization area when he was able and waited for EMS to arrive. Patient was treated by EMS and left the building with them under his own power.

                                                Patient walked to th chair for observation, within a minute patient leans forward then fell over chair to his right and landed on face. I(pharmacist) ran to his side, I though he was having a seizure ,yelled to my technician to call 911 , but with further assesment I knew he didnt have a seizure, he fell on his face and his arms tucked under his abdomen, so he couldn&#39;t lift himself up properly. I sat him up,he was responsive to my questions, pulse was very faint and he started to sweat,pale,clammy . His nose was bleeding from the fall. Within 9 minutes paramedic showed up , took blood pressure and glucose check. After assesment they didn&#39;t feel it was necessary to go to emergency room. Patient didn&#39;t eat breakfast,got him apple juice and chocolate. This never happened to him before. His friend came to meet him and make sure he was ok, he left voluntarily ,and back to himself.

                                                Patient walked out fine after receiving the vaccine. Was able to walk up to the registration desk and carried a conversation with the staffs. He sits down in the waiting area to be monitored. We heard his phone dropped, looked up and saw him tilting over on the right side was about to fall off the chair. Staff grabbed him and held him back onto the seat, proceeded to picked up his right arm and held him in place. He looked unconscious while staff held him. He came back to his senses approximately 10 seconds later. After he regained consciousness, staff took his blood pressure which was 111/44, SpO2 was 100%, and heart rate 58. Patient looked pale but not critical. Conversed with our staff and stated that this has happened before when he receives other vaccinations. Patient&#39;s father is a physician and reported that the patient is scared of needles and did not need any medications from anaphylaxis kit or crash cart. We gave him water and he left after sitting for a while.

I waited for 30 minutes and was perfectly fine.  Around 5 pm I started to feel symptoms.  I got the worst aches in my entire body i&#39;ve ever felt before, along with chills.  I felt extremely hot, I took my temperature and had a fever of 102.3.  I felt dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseas .  My head was throbbing.  I ended up taking 1000mg of tylenol to help reduce the fever, which seemed to really help.  I fell asleep and woke up the next morning drenched in sweat.  My fever was gone, but I still had a horrible headache and threw up from the nausea I was having.  It felt like I had a horrible hangover.

                                                After previously feeling no side effects, at 3am the day following the vaccine I awoke with chills, dizziness, fatigue, whole body arthralgias that I can only describe as feeling like my bedsheets felt like broken glass. Around 6am I measured my axillary temperature to be 100.9 F and took 650 Tylenol once which broke the fever. I was unable to go in to work that day. Now, two days after the vaccine, my other symptoms have resolved aside from a painful, and visibly noticable, lymph adenopathy in my left arm pit the same side as the vaccine.

                                                got up about 5:15AM to use the restroom, parents heard a huge crash and we came running - he had collapsed and fainted in the bathroom, against the toilet, (with shelves and glass crashing down him - he grabbed the shelves and had a few cuts and bruises), was unresponsive, no color in his face, could not stand or move, could barely speak - slumped against the toilet.  Parents called 911 and tried to get him to respond, he was listless but opened his eyes - we lifted him and moved him to recliner in living room.  Fire Dept./EMT&#39;s arrived within a few minutes, blood pressure was 87/43, glucose was normal.  EMT&#39;s determined it was a reaction to the vaccine and asked if he wanted an ambulance or if parents should drive him for further care - he opted for us to drive him (his Mom called the Dr. on staff first - Dr. said it was a reaction to the vaccine and he should not get a 2nd dose).  Patient&#39;s Dad took him to Urgent Care - they ran an EKG (normal), and stayed there until his blood pressure showed (although still low)  normal/acceptable again.  I looked at the CDC website for covid anaphylaxis and it appears it was an allergic reaction (cardiovascular), on the site, he had these symptoms:  &#34;Cardiovascular: fainting; hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure); pallor.  ... Symptoms of anaphylaxis often occur within 15-30 minutes of vaccination, though it can sometimes take several hours for symptoms to appear.&#34;

                                                The first few days it was extreme muscle pain in my shoulder and arm. My arm was swollen for about 3 days, I couldn?t move my arm for almost a whole week. My muscles were very weak in the arm and hurt to put pressure on it and couldn?t lift my arm. It has gotten better but it has now been 3 weeks and I am still experiencing some muscle pain and weakness in my left shoulder. The shit was administered in my left arm  directly below my shoulder bone.  I still can?t move my arm to shoulder height or higher with feeling pain and weakness in the muscle.

Simultaneously this is mixed with fatigue regardless of how much sleep I get or water that I drink. Less frequently I have symptoms like eyes burning (similar to bad allergies), slight dizziness, minor headaches, and minor body aches. The fatigue and brain fog are by far the worst and still persist, the others listed are minor but still come and go in small amounts. On Wednesday (4/14) I took Zyrtec (10mg tablet) to help focus throughout the day then one ibuprofen tablet (200mg) at night, and on Friday (4/16) I only took the Zyrtec. Since then I have not taken any medications. The symptoms were alleviated by the medication but without them all symptoms come and go to varying degrees throughout the day and worsen by night time.

                                                fell out completely; passed out/fell off at the store; feeling dizzy; had terrible headache; chills; weak with shilling; i started sweating; I&#39;m still feeling very sick; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 24-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158; Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eye allergy. Concomitant medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AMOXICILINA CLAV) taken for eye allergy from 12Apr2021. On 14Apr2021, he received the first dose of the vaccine about an hour ago and waited five minutes and went to the bathroom. He had a severe reaction while patient was in the bathroom, he started to feel dizzy, had a terrible headache and chills. He walked out of the bathroom at the store and fell out completely in front of the pharmacists. The patient also experienced weak with shilling (as reported) and started sweating. The pharmacists called 911 and the responders checked his vitals and blood pressure and all of that and everything was fine. Patient clarified he passed out completely for almost 5 minutes. Patient stayed there with everyone until, they were waiting to see how he was doing. He reported he was feeling much better now, still feel a bit dizzy, not 100% but not as bad as when it happened. It has improved and he definitely felt terrible at the time. He was monitoring himself at home to see if he notices something weird going on. He does not have a headache right now and was feeling much better. When he was having the effect, he was mentally sharp, and knew what was going on. He thought about letting himself walk outside the bathroom so he could be seen. He didn&#39;t lose track of what was going on and body reacted adversely. He remembered stuff and everything and he felt good. Patient stated the chills went away; however, would not say they went away completely, he was recovering. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office and the paramedic said it was not necessary right now because all the vitals and everything else seemed fine. There was no therapy received for the events. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the vaccine and no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of events feeling dizzy, terrible headache, chills was recovering; still feeling very sick was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

                                                During screening questions patient reported a one time history of passing out after a vaccine when he was a teenager. Patient received first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine and sat in chairs to be observed. About 15 minutes later I walked out to check on the patient and he was staring straightforward, sweating, and pale. When asked if he was okay he stated his vision was looking blurry and felt dizzy. Took patient&#39;s blood pressure, elevated his legs as I couldn&#39;t move him safely at the time, gave him water to drink, applied cool compresses to neck and forehead. Patient was observed by a clinic staff member during entire event. Rechecked patient&#39;s blood pressure 5 minutes later at resolution of symptoms. Patient then left with adult visitor that came with him.

                                                Around 12:05pm on 5/5/21, Five minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient fainted while in the waiting room.  We came out to assist and at that point the patient was already sitting up, but on the floor.  We were able to speak to him and gave him some water to drink.  We called 911, when we were aware he had fainted.  I was the pharmacist on duty, but not the one that vaccinated him.  So I stayed with him.  There was a moment when he took his sweater off saying he was hot, and I saw sweat bullets on his forehead.  So I got some paper towels for him and took his temperature, which read around 98 degrees.  A few seconds later he turned pale and fell over, hitting his head on one of the shelves.  I quickly got him off the shelf and held his head in my arms .  He opened his eyes and started talking and wanting to sit up, but we kept him laying down and continued to ask him questions to keep him alert.  He was able to answer the questions, knew where he was, who he was, who he was with .  The paramedics then arrived and he was taken out of the store on a stretcher.  We provided a copy of the report he filled out to the paramedics .

When he attempted to stand up to move to the cot, he was unable to steady himself and he said he felt shaky, so RN, brought cot to him, and a few Admin staff surrounded him with drapes dividers. He laid on the cot to rest, legs elevated, and he stayed approx 30minutes. He said he was cold and he just felt &#34;off.&#34; Today&#39;s dose was his second, and he said he had no reaction to the first dose. He said he ate today. He drank an 8oz bottle of water. Cool pack applied to back of his neck. He said he felt nausous,and was unable to sit up after several minutes of laying down on the cot. After some deep breathing exercises, and resting, he began to feel a little better. RN brought his wife into the area from the car where she was waiting. Eventually, he said he was feeling steady enough to sit in a chair. RN&#39;s, B and D helped him out of cot and into a folding chair. After a few minutes, he said he still felt &#34;not like himself&#34; and the decision was made to go to the urgent care. RN D and worker assisted patient to the passenger side of the car. 1500: 124/90 P99  T98.3 R16  1515: 120/70 P67 T98.3 POx99% 1530: 120/78 P80 POx 99% R1

                                                24-year-old male with no prior medical problems presents for evaluation of chest pain.  Patient complains of midsternal chest pain that started approximately an hour ago.  He states that it woke him up from sleep.  Pain is sharp without any radiation or other associated symptoms including diaphoresis presyncopal symptoms or palpitations.  He denies any significant air hunger or shortness of breath.  He otherwise had been feeling better after what he tall was post COVID vaccine symptoms.  Patient received a 2nd dose of pfizer vaccine 3 days ago.  He states that within 24 hours he had symptoms of myalgia fever and feeling unwell.  That has been resolving patient has been feeling better until the chest pain today. Patient otherwise denies any other medical problems in.  He denies any history of drug use including any recent cocaine or other drug abuse.   Elevated cardiac enzymes and chest discomfort are likely secondary to myocarditis and secondary to vaccination/ inflammatory reaction.  Although there is low likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease as well.  I recommended cardiac catheterization for clarification.  He does not want to have the procedure done, understands the risk of undiagnosed coronary artery disease and risk of MI.  He would like to be discharged home.    I reviewed the images of echocardiogram and it seems that he has a small area of hypokinesis in infero basal segment.   Recommended to take aspirin and be seen in Cardiology office in 2 weeks.  Advised to abstain from exercise and significant physical activity till that time and return to the hospital if any symptoms.       Subjective:   I saw patient in consultation for evaluation of chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes.   Patient is a 24-year-old healthy male who had COVID-19 vaccination with his second Pfizer shot 4/14/21. He developed fever, chills, nausea and vomiting 1 day after vaccination.  He did not have any reaction to the 1st dose.   He presented to the hospital with substernal chest discomfort which woke him up from sleep, radiated to throat and had a throbbing feeling.

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  I experienced extreme chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath, painful heart beats, I could feel each beat. I hunched over in my bed groom grabbing my abdomen and fell onto my bed and almost passed out from whack I?d assume is lack of oxygen. I could barely breathe for about five minutes and felt relatively severe pain particularly in the right side of my chest. I could feel every muscle, tendon, and artery inflamed, enlarged, and hurting. My chest felt like it filled up with a balloon. Heart rate went up too. I have NEVER EVER felt ANYTHING like this in my LIFE. Not even close. It was a brand new sensation to me first time I?ve ever felt anything like this at all, and very intense and frustrating. Keeping in mind I am in perfect health. I am a body builder with a perfect physique. I work at a high end restaurant and have an extremely good diet. I have a normal sleep and sexual routine, I don?t use any medications whatsoever even Tylenol or ibuprofen. I have no pre existing conditions. I have no history of heart or cardio problems. My family has a history of low blood pressure. I have next to no stress or anxiety in my life. I am 24 years old I work out and run miles, five to six days a week. I don?t use nicotine, tobacco, and I haven?t had a drink of alcohol in ten years (14yrs old). I smoke marijuana on a daily basis. After about ten minutes the incident went down and I was able to breathe a little better but still had pain and tightness in my chest. I have had shortness of breath ever since. This is being written the day after the event about 26 hours later. I ran a mile last night and went to the gym it seemed to help both my breathing and the pain and tightness but it has not fully gone away. I feel my heart straining somehow as I am typing this. One thing to note is I did not want to get vaccinated but was pressured to do so, and before getting it I was very nervous and honestly upset. The woman administering it was not helpful at all and actually mocked my unsureness and was very rude and unprofessional. She didn?t answer any technical questions I had. During my interaction with her between my nerves and her behavior I?m absolutely certain my heart rate was elevated at the time of getting the shot. I have only had one shot. The episode of  myocarditis occurred two weeks after my first shot. Two days after my scheduled second shot, which I missed because of work and was going to reschedule before this occurred. I am not going to be getting the second shot. Will be following up with my primary care doctor as soon as possible. Haven?t had time.

                                                Days following dose 2, I began having fluid retention and elevated blood pressure.  Over time, it has worsened.  I am now having dizzy spells that can last 10 minutes to 6 hours up to twice a day, confusion/brain fog and heart flutters/elevated heart rate usually accompanied with fatigue.  My previous doctor treated me by increasing the metoprolol and adding hydrochlorothiazide for fluid retention.  I saw a new healthcare provider who is sending me to a cardiologist, neurologist, lipidologist and endocrinologist to figure out what is going  on.  I can not function in daily life. I cannot stand when dizzy and cannot drive.  Symptoms appear to be worsening.  In the meantime, he prescribed Ubrelvy to rule out migraines.  None of this appeared until after dose 2 of Pfizer.

                                                Around 6 pm the same day of first pfizer vaccine (3/18/21), i woke up from a nap and my back hurt so bad that i couldn&#39;t leave the bed without falling out. My parents came and helped me out and gave me painkillers but really nothing helped. Next day, it started down my right arm (the arm NOT injected with the shot) and it started to hurt in my muscles everywhere and hasn&#39;t stopped to this day (3/25/21). Numbness and pins and needles feeling have occurred in my pinky and ring finger of right arm. Pain has now started in my knees as well after a few days from the shot. No pain killers work and I&#39;m unable to write or type properly, or even work at my job frankly. I can&#39;t hold an object without it falling out of my hand, and when i am able to hold something, after about 2 seconds pain fills my arm. Nothing helps the pain. I saw my primary care physician on 3/25/21 and the PA said there wasn&#39;t anything to do for the intense pain i was having except take tylenol arthritis, melatonin (to help me sleep through the pain), exercise (even though it may cause me even worse pain), and a stress ball for my arm. I don&#39;t know what else to do with this pain and this was only the first round of shots.

My manager rushed to catch him from falling and I assisted in steadying him. He was breathing erratically, excessively diaphoretic, and his muscles were twitching frequently. His eyes were dilated and he became unresponsive. Fearing a seizure, we lowered him to the floor and turned him on his side. He became responsive and coherent again approximately one minute later and was speaking to us normally. Paramedics arrived several minutes later and took over care. He was taken to the hospital due to abnormal vital signs.

                                                Patient reported to clinic for Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination.  Patient did not indicate on questionnaire that he had experienced fainting or severe reactions from receiving vaccinations before. About 5 seconds after receiving vaccination patient said he would like to sit for just a minute.  The clinic had a designated waiting area about 25 feet away where patients sit for 15 minutes after receiving vaccination.  My technician and I agreed that patient should stay seated in the same chair he was receiving the vaccination in so we would be right next to him.  After 2-3 minutes I noticed the patient had his eyes closed and then his head began to nod and he started to slump down in the chair.  As I went to patient&#39;s side to stabilize him he pushed his chair backwards away from me about 5 feet which caused him to roll to the right side of the chair and fall off hitting his head on the floor. My technician immediately called 911 and EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes.  A bystander who was a nurse helped me roll him onto his back and we propped his legs up with 2 cushions.  We took his blood pressure and pulse. Patient regained consciousness in about 30 seconds and the EMTs cleared him to stand up after about 15 minutes.  After patient had recovered, patient&#39;s mother who was there with patient and other siblings stated that the whole family has fainting episodes when receiving vaccinations. I informed patient&#39;s mother and patient to please inform any future vaccinators of these fainting episodes so they can be prepared.

Transported to urgent care for monitoring, and discharged in stable condition.  Provider conclusion is that patient experienced a vasovagal event secondary to injection.  Vaccine itself does not appear to have any correlation to the event, but given that patient was transferred to a higher level of care, will submit a VAERS report.

                                                Nurse at clinic incorrectly diluted a Pfizer vaccine vial with 0.8 ml of sodium chloride instead of 1.8 ml of sodium chloride and administered 0.3 ml to the patient. The patient experienced 104 degree fever with vomiting, dizziness and extreme muscle joint pain. We explained to him that we noticed the dose he was given had been diluted improperly and he had received a slightly higher than normal dose.   I apologized for the incident and he said ?it?s ok?, and that now he knew why he was so sick.  He was very pleasant and appreciative of us trying to contact him over the weekend.   He was encouraged to contact us with any questions or if any new symptoms arise.   We also offered to have one of our providers contact him to discuss further, but he declined.

                                                The patient reported that they were experiencing tightness in their arm and believed it swelled initially. They left the pharmacy area and went to get Tylenol that was recommended by the pharmacist. They then began to get lightheaded and had syncope, attempted to get back up and the cashier asked to if they wanted to sit, but fell again. It was not clear initially to the employee who was helping them they had received the vaccine. 911 was called and the employee helping them let the pharmacist know they had just gotten their vaccine. The immunizing pharmacist went to check on the patient. EMTs were already helping the patient and had taken his blood pressure which was normal the lightheadedness had stopped and both sitting and standing blood pressure was the same. He had an elevated heart rate per the patient but didn&#39;t know any of the numbers the EMTs had taken. His father was driving him. He was not experiencing any symptoms and the injection site had no swelling and was otherwise unremarkable.

                                                We had a patient today that passed out after his covid vaccine.  It was his 2nd covid immunization.  He got his immunization at the pharmacy in the booth and then he sat down in one of the waiting chairs at the end of the cough and cold aisle.  While he was sitting down, he began to feel unwell, he then got up off his chair and then was approaching the drop off window (he was going to let us know he didn&#39;t feel well) at that time he then passed out.  He fell into the privacy screen of the imz booth.  He did fall into the booth which did break some of his fall.  He also knocked off one of the frames that we had on the wall, and then I think it fell on his nose.  He did get a cut nose and he also bit his lip or mouth because his mouth was bleeding also.  He reported that his nose did hurt, and he will have a prominent bruise on his nose.   We did provide him with a couple of ice packs and a bottle of water.   The patient (25 years old) and his mother both stated that he has passed out in the past when he has been around needles.  He stated that he got to thinking about getting the shot and the needle going into his arm and that is when he started to feel unwell.

                                                On Wednesday April 14th I got my second vaccination shot. The following day I had a 103 F fever, body aches, chills, migraine, sore muscles, couldn&#39;t walk, excessive thirst. Those effects lasted all day and I felt better on Friday. Saturday night chest pain started along with sore arm getting worse. I took ibuprofen and melatonin to sleep. Woke up Sunday morning and pain came back and gradually got worse until I went into the ER around 9 am. They gave me Morphine to put the chest pain at bay. Then transferred me by ambulance to a different hospital with a cariology department. They treated me as if it was Myocarditis and also got an x-ray of my chest. The next morning I had an MRI and that is what confirmed it to be Myocarditis. I was then discharged with lots of medications to keep the inflammation down.

                                                25yo male patient fainted about 5min after receiving the vaccine while sitting in an observation chair. He fell to the side off his chair and hit head on the concrete floor, with his body still on the chair. Patient had convulsion-like movements. It was unclear if it was seizure-type activity or if his body was struggling to sit up from the supine position laying on the chair. Patient was attended to immediately by pharmacist  - he responded immediately to my talking to him and touching his shoulders. Patient was guided to an upright seated position, then helped to floor and asked to lie on floor with legs elevated. 911 was called and Seattle Fire Dept arrived about 5min later. Patient was fully aware of surroundings, his name, etc. Evaluated him and took multiple blood pressure readings with him laying on floor and eventually sitting up. His pressure was initially low but recovered to normal over 15-30 minutes. Ambulance was called but patient declined as his parents were on their way. Patient&#39;s blood pressure recovered to normal and he was able to sit and stand, was fully conversational throughout the episode. Patient left building of his own accord with his family to seek medical follow-up.

                                                The arm that I received the vaccine in (Right Arm) Has been falling asleep if I hold it still, in as little as 10 minutes.  This hasn?t been too big of an issue while awake, But in my sleep last night I woke up around eight times with my arm completely dead limp and getting no blood circulation.  I had to move it around with my left hand for a while to force blood circulation before I could move my right arm again. I would then do little blood circulating exercises with my right hand and arm until it felt normal again, Then I would go back to sleep. I was sleeping on the opposite side (on left arm or back) So there was nothing else that could?ve been cutting off circulation. This is not something that?s normal for me. I spoke to a nurse at the site that administered the dose, and she advised me to call back and get an appointment with a nurse if the problem continues in my sleep tonight.

                                                9 hours after the shot I started to feel really groggy and sore with my left arm hurting. 12 hours in I started to feel like I had a fever so i checked it and it was 102 degree F, I was also unable to pick my left arm up due to the pain and my whole body hurt a lot. 13 hours in at about 10 pm that night I started full-body shaking violently and needed help from my parents into my room because I could not walk because my legs were wobbling so much. I felt lightheaded and the shaking continued for about 20 minutes. During this time I checked my temp again and it was 105 degrees F. Once the shaking stopped the fever and intense pain continued until 2 am when it dropped down to 102 degrees F and I was able to fall asleep. The next morning I woke at 8am with a temp of 100 degree F with the same all-over-body pain that lasted all day but the fever dropped until that night. That night it came back at 100 degrees F.  This cycle lasted from when I got my shot on the 1st until 4th when the fever stopped. The pain has subsided around the 6th. But I am currently still having pain in my left shoulder where I got my shot today on the 8th.

It has been 3 weeks and I am not feeling better at all. I have a pounding heartbeat, and a pounding headache.  At this point the vaccine has been worse than the disease itself. I hope you stop misleading the public and communicate that myocarditis and severe inflammation IS 100% A SIDE EFFECT THAT IS CAUSED BY THE VACCINE RESPONSE. I know because I am experiencing it, and you&#39;ve ruined the last 24 days of my life. Thank you.

After about a week, COVID fog/fatigue symptoms began.  It is currently 6 weeks later and I have fatigue, shortness of breath, head pressure, double vision, cannot concentrate for any length of time and dizziness/unsteadiness.  I have not been able to go to work since the vaccination and have people helping take care of me.  I cannot take a shower without being short of breath after.  I have been put on 2 different rounds of steroids ? the 2nd more aggressive, which did not make a difference.  I have been to my general doctor several times, an allergist and a neurologist.  I have had extensive bloodwork, an MRI, and an EKG ? all were normal.  My symptoms have not improved at all in the past 3-4 weeks.

                                                Over a month after receiving my second dose of Pfizer, I had an episode of lightheadedness, dizziness, shakiness, and fatigue. I attributed it to dehydration and laid down and ate a snack, I began to feel better after 1-2 hours. A week later I had another lightheadedness incident that sent me back to bed (this one being slightly worse). I experience slight chest pain in my upper right chest muscle. It took me a day to recover from this spell. I constantly felt weak and as if I was about to faint. I went to the doctor two days later and got blood work done and measured my blood pressure. Everything came back normal. On Saturday June 19th, I had another near-fainting experience in a public setting. My hearing changed, I couldn&#39;t think straight, I was very shaky and weak, and I tried to drink a lot of water. Nothing helped so I went home and once I got in bed I was aggressively shaking. Since then I have been bed-ridden for the week, and unable to do normal activities such as go for walks, exercise, or go to work. I am going to visit a cardiologist tomorrow.

I counseled that his arm may be sore and he may have side effects such as fatigue, headache, chills after his second dose. I then administered the vaccine in the left deltoid and counseled him to have a seat in the waiting area for 15 minutes. His girlfriend came up to the window about 15 minutes later and said he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He was reporting pounding headache and fatigue as well as dizziness. I got him some water and suggested that he lie down until he felt better. It sounded like a typical syncope reaction. After lying down and drinking water for 15-20 minutes he still wasn&#39;t feeling better. He requested that we call paramedics, who arrive around 3:15pm and took over.

I started getting more of a wet, heavy cough. Most of the phlegm I was coughing up was coming from my lungs. I was getting light headed and breathing was getting very struggled. On the evening of 6/10/2021, my mom advised that I go to the ER as my breathing was getting very taxed. During this visit I was diagnosed with RSV and tested COVID negative.
