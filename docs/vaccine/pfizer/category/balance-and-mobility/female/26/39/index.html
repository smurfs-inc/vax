                                                24 hours after vaccine, I had typical mild cold/flu symptoms. After 48 hours I had a lot of pain in my injection arm and my armpit lymph nodes were swollen. I treated the pain with Advil and a heating pad. 72 hours after the vaccine I felt faint, dizzy, and nauseous. I began to vomit and have diarrhea that entire night and next morning. I felt very weak and was unable to keep any foods or liquids down. I was unable to walk around. I took Zofran 8mg which helped with the severe nausea and weakness.  These symptoms are ongoing.

Did not say anything and sat there for the 15 minutes with continued shortness of breath and high rate think it was anxiety. When the time was up I continued to stay at the hospital for an hour due to fear of bad reaction. Started to become extremely nauseous within 30 minutes and loss of appetite. Went to bed and woke up with a terrible headache, body aches, extreme fatigue and a 100.3 degree fever. Slept for 8 hours during the day waking up due to the pain in my body and chills but the symptoms went away by 5 pm the following day of the shot.

After the second dose of vaccine, the patient woke up on 09Jan2021 at 06:30 feeling very fatigued with a dry cough, dizziness, an aching headache that felt heavy (4/10 pain). Later in the day she started having muscle spasms in her hips, knees, shoulders and jaw (7/10 pain). These spasms felt like someone was stabbing her with an electric knife. Over the day the spasms settled into her right hip and knee. Paracetamol (TYLENOL) helped managing the pain and sleep helped the pain getting better. On 10Jan2021 the patient woke up with a slight headache (2/10 pain) and slight dizziness. Her hip felt sore and achy, but she only felt slight spasms when she put weight on it. The events were resolving at the time of report.

                                                Within five minutes I felt very faint and dizzy along with nausea. Then came the shortness of breath and the feeling of pins and needles which also brought itching and some minor hives with it. The dizziness, nausea, and feeling of fainting went away after about 10 minutes and I had to go to the Emergency Department to take care of the shortness of breath and hive like reaction. I was given some medications and they diagnosed it as a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine. I was completely fine with the first one.

Headache and body aches have worsened in severity. Unable to work for the morning but was able to go in the afternoon for a short time period. Lower body aches are particularly severe. Fatigue is noticeable. Mental health conditions have worsened but that may be due to lack of sleep.  30 hours following the vaccine: chills, nausea, and dizziness have dissipated completely. They were slowly improving throughout the day. Body aches and headache still severe but lessened with marijuana use.  48 hours following the vaccine: all symptom seemed to have subsided during the night. Sleep was much better quality.

This was treated by reclining with feet up, sitting in a dark room, and drinking cold water while monitoring symptoms. Symptoms resolved within minutes.  About an hour after injection lethargy, feeling chilled, in particular hands were very cold, mental fog, and slurred speech. This resolved without intervention within a couple of hours.

She had her eyes closed and said she felt faint. Notified incident command to call for provider. We moved her to an exam room so she could lie down. She said she felt warm and dizzy.

Waited with patient until 4:50, able to stand on own, not dizzy anymore, felt okay to leave.

                                                I am a pharmacist for pharmacy and received my first dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine while at work by another pharmacist.  Vaccine given around 2:15 PM on 2/2/21  Less than 5 minutes after vaccine - arm tingling at site of injection, arm tingling spread from injection site to fingers, tingling and pins/needles traveled through underarm area and moved across left side of chest, slight chest pain on left side, whole body started tingling, dizziness, racing heart. While experiencing all of these symptoms, I sat on the ground, took two tablets of 25mg Benadryl, drank water, and tried to breath steady to make dizziness go away. Working in this healthcare setting, I was aware I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and was prepared with an epi-pen in case of any severe anaphylaxis shock - I did NOT have to use the epi-pen.    Less than 15 minutes after vaccine - the chest pain, arm pins/needles stopped, I felt lightheaded still, another co-worker checked my blood pressure which had risen to 178/120 and pulse of 120.   About 1 hour after vaccine - still felt light headed, blood pressure still elevated at 158/107, pulse of 107.   Around 5:45 PM - After consulting personal friend physicians, I was instructed to go to ER and have an EKG of my heart since my blood pressure and pulse had spiked so high and suddenly. I was able to find coverage at work so that I could leave my shift and get a ride to the emergency room.   After 6 PM (admitted into ER) - upon admission blood pressure of 176/117 and pulse of 113

                                                About 2 minutes after injection, I had a sudden rush of warmth throughout my body starting in my abdomen then causing my pulse to feel like it was pounding out of my neck. Got light headed. EMS came and my blood pressure raised to 155/95 and my pulse was up in the 150s and I was shaking.  Started to go down but felt crappy for over 2 hours. Happened again 30seconds after the second injection. Pulse up to almost 160. 02 stats stayed normal. Post first injection had sore arm and lots of fatigue and brain fog. Following the second injection 12 hours post started having nausea, and diarrhea. Continued to have joint pain, muscle aches, headaches for days, and my lymph nodes swelled up and were extremely painful.

The following days after I was okay, with a sore throat only occurring in the evening after 4pm, along with vertigo and slight disorientation for approximately 8 days. Starting Saturday, 02/13 around 8pm I noticed a tingling sensation in my right middle finger, that continued to Sunday and through to today. As of this morning, 02/15, I still have the nerve pain in my finger that is now spreading to the palm of my hand.

                                                I received my COVID19 vaccines on 12/31/2020 and 1/21/2021. On 2/3/2021 I woke up with pain, swelling, redness, and decreased range of motion in my R elbow at the site where I had hardware (wires, pins, tension band) placed during a surgical repair of my olecranon process in 2013. I have never had any issues with this elbow since the surgery, and no illnesses/dental work/medication changes in the months before this. The only change was getting my COVID vaccine. I went to see my PCP Dr. who advised me to go to the ER due to fear of a potential infection based on these symptoms. I went to the ER and after extensive testing they ruled out this being an infectious cause, though I was put on PO doxycycline as a precaution. An orthopedic specialist came to see me and determined that my body is essentially rejecting the hardware and I need to have surgery to have it removed. Since then, the swelling has decreased, however I still have persistent pain in my elbow along the site where the hardware is inserted and limited mobility due to pain with certain movements that put tension on this joint. I will need to have surgery eventually to have the hardware removed but am hoping to wait a couple months so that I can complete nursing school. I was advised to report any potential side effects from this vaccine and am choosing to do so as I do not know of any other reason this could be happening.

                                                I waited my 15 minutes after getting the shot and then spent maybe another 10 finding my car and leaving the lot. I had only been driving for a few minutes, maybe less than five when I felt like my arm I got the shot in started to go numb and soon followed a feeling of lightheadness. I thought about pulling off to the side but didn&#39;t make it in time because the next thing I knew I woke up pressed against the median on the other side of the freeway I was driving on. I completely blacked out while driving. I had to call an ambulance because I was freaked out and wanted to be looked at and my car needed to be towed.

It is still hurting.; Tenderness; Feeling faint/Felt dizzy; Some trouble breathing; disoriented; Fatigue; Chills; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information Team. A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 28Jan2021 at 16:55 (reported as 4:55 PM) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. It was given at a vaccination clinic. The patient had no prior vaccination within 4 weeks and had no adverse events following prior vaccinations and that was why she thought she would be fine. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included anxiety, peanut allergy, tree nut allergy, and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. Family history included her dad has heart disease and her half sister has heart disease. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization. The patient stated, &#34;You kind of feel yucky after the flu vaccine, but she has never had this with a flu shot.&#34; The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t had a flu shot in years. The patient asked if arm swelling was a normal occurrence after vaccination and if side effects can last for 4 days. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan and afterwards experienced, arm swelling, and tenderness that has last for 4 days. She also reported experiencing feeling faint, high blood pressure of 150/100 and some trouble breathing on an unspecified date and nausea. The patient further reported that she was calling because she got her first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine and she was curious if this was normal and if she needs to go see her doctor and she wants to report the symptoms. After she got the injection she felt super faint and got really high blood pressure on an unspecified date. She was not sure if it was because she had anxiety, but she had trouble breathing on an unspecified date. She got nauseated afterwards. Her arm swelled up really big and the swelling has stayed there for four days. Her arm was still swollen on an unspecified date. She has allergies and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. She was still nauseated and feels super tired. The patient asked how long do the symptoms last. The patient&#39;s weight was reported between 122 to 123 pounds. The patient clarified that the nausea started 15 minutes after she got the shot on 28Jan2021. The nausea has lasted through this. She got chills the next day (29Jan2021) after the shot. She has felt super fatigue. The swelling has gone down, but it was still swollen. It was still hurting. She has no idea if that was normal. She also felt dizzy and disoriented after getting the shot. She was not sure if it was because her blood pressure was so high. It was high for her because her blood pressure was normally low. She thinks her blood pressure 150/100 after she got the vaccine. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

I?ll be functioning normally and then a wave of dizziness runs through me. This has persisted for nearly 4 weeks with only minor improvement. It feels like I?m ?off?, not debilitating enough to cancel work/plans, but persistent enough to know something isn?t normal. Had no symptoms prior to receiving the shot.

                                                Within two hours of my shot, I had a headache/muscle aches and felt dizzy/dissociated, and left work early. I started to feel feverish in the early evening, I began experiencing nausea around 3 am that night. This became vomiting about twenty minutes later. I vomited four times over the course of the next half hour: 3:30-4:00 am. I also started experiencing diarrhea at about 4:00 am. I had five loose, near-water stools over the course of the rest of the night until around 9 am, two of which I vomited at the same time. By the time the worst of it stopped, I&#39;d vomited 10 times from 3:30 am  - 10 am. I also experienced a fever from that afternoon onward, with chills/night sweats throughout the worst of the digestive upset until the morning. I couldn&#39;t keep fluids down until midmorning 3/18 and couldn&#39;t keep solids down until that evening, around 7 pm. It&#39;s 3/19 and I&#39;ve had two glasses of water and a piece of toast and still feel nauseous. A friend of mine had some Zofran, which I took one dose of around 10 am 3/18, which allowed me to keep fluids down and not have to return to the hospital.

I sat for 20 minutes and took a Tylenol. I left the site and about 30 minutes later I was feeling extremely tired, and out of breath. Talking was difficult and taking too much energy, my shortness of breath was alarming. It went away within 4 hours.  2 days later I was feeling fine, and was sitting having a coffee. Out of nowhere I had a rapid heartbeat and started feeling woozy and light headed again. I didn&#39;t have as much shortness of breath but it felt like if I were to try and do anything it would exhaust me. I took Tylenol again and things calmed down in about 2-3 hours.

Patient evaluate 2 L of fluid given her Mirena IUD D-dimer was sent which was negative patient with no pleuritic symptoms or dyspnea to suggest pulmonary embolism. Otherwise hemodynamically stable on exam ambulates with no difficulty no focal neurologic deficits. Patient did describe on her initial presentation that she noted some weakness of her bilateral legs. Given her possible viral reaction and description of weakness it is possible the patient is developing an early autoimmune reaction however she has no evidence of GuillainBarré or transverse myelitis on my exam. We will plan to discharge with neurology follow-up as outpatient.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine, I began having chills and vomited. My fatigue became more severe as well. Later that evening my fatigue persisted and I noticed a rapid heart rate via my Watch. My resting heart rate which usually is about 80 BPM was at 100 while laying down and not engaged in any physical activity. When I stood I was dizzy and had poor balance. While my entire arm no longer hurt, the injection site showed a bump as well. When I awoke the next day my heart rate appeared normal again, and I wasn&#39;t especially fatigued compared to before I got the vaccine. I did experience another minor gastro-intestinal episode later that afternoon, but otherwise my symptoms appeared to have passed aside from the fatigue. By the end of my work day I was very tired again, although it is uncertain if this is due to the vaccine or from my continued recovery from Covid and adjusting to the physical demands of going back to my job in-person. Because I received my vaccine on the same day as my first day back to work, I have no experience working post-covid before having the vaccine to compare my current state of fatigue to. On the evening of 01/07 I noted that fatigue was slightly less pronounced. I do not currently have a primary care doctor but will be calling to try to gain an appointment so that my second dose can be monitored.

This lasted about 15 or 20 minutes I&#39;m guessing (hard to say for sure because I was too worked up to watch the clock) but I ended up making myself fall back asleep. The next day January 8th I had diarrhea multiple times in theafternoon and felt strange, somewhat lightheaded and some what felt like anxiety.

                                                When I received my first dose of the Pfizer COVID shot I had no issues. When I received the second dose I had the vaccine injected and then I got up and walked to the monitoring room where we sit for 15 minutes. Immediately upon sitting down in that room I felt very woozy, lightheaded, and my heart was beating out of my chest. I checked my pulse on my smart watch and it was in the 80s but my resting HR is normally in the 60s or 70s. I got nervous at that point so I took some deep breaths and tried to relax and my symptoms improved within a minute. I sat for the remainder of the monitoring period and right at my 15 minute mark all of my symptoms returned. HR in the 100s, lightheaded like I was going to pass out, chest heaviness, and shortness of breath. I alerted the nurse in the monitoring room and she took my BP and HR and they have me a bottle of water. My throat felt a little weird too and I was worried that it was starting to close up, but I was able to swallow  water normally. I remained in the monitoring room for about 15 more minutes and at that point my symptoms mostly resolved and I felt well enough to leave. For the next approx 48 hours I have had some mild- moderate chest heaviness. More worse in the initial 24-36 hours after the vaccination.

                                                When I went to get the shot, I had a  firm bump with what looked like a white head on my left arm from the first shot. When she injected the 2nd dose, the bump was painful and grew twice in size on my arm and started bleeding. The technician rubbed the area for a fews minutes and the swelling went down. The bump went down, but the whole day, I felt a little sick. At around 7pm, I felt feverish, with muscle aches and chills. My skin was sensitive to touch, I felt nauseous, and I could barely walk. The bottom of my left eyelid also became a little swollen. The symptoms resolved the next morning.

I was laid down and vital signs were taken. My heart rate was in the 110s and 120s and stayed elevated for about four hours. The hives resolved and did not spread to the bilateral arm or anywhere else. The following two days I felt incredibly weak and had urinary frequency. I was told to go to the hospital by the health clinic staff but I declined.

A 27-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), intramuscular at Left arm on 06Jan2021 15:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Medical history included swine flu. Concomitant medications included buspirone, venlafaxine, amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL XR), ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (AVIANE) for birth control, plantago ovata fibre (FIBER SUPPLEMENT), probiotics and women&#39;s multi-vitamin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s historic vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL0140), Intramuscular at left arm on 21Dec2020 15:15 for covid-19 immunization. On 07Jan2021 11:00, the patient experienced fever, pulsating migraine, joint and muscle aches and pains, dizziness, fatigue - absolutely could not have went to work if she was scheduled that day - just moving from her left side onto her right side took immense effort and tears - haven&#39;t experienced anything like it since she had swine flu. No treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events fever, pulsating migraine, &#39;joint and muscle aches and pains&#39;, dizziness, fatigue was recovered on an unknown date in Jan2021.

                                                I was asymptomatic for about 6.5 hours after the vaccine was given. At about 6pm on the day I received the vaccine I noticed some injection site tenderness, minimal swelling; has been present since. Symptoms are very mild. I started having chills and hot flashes intermittently, more hot flashes than chills, have been present since 6pm yesterday. About 9pm I had a headache, muscle aches, joint pain as well. I felt feverish but temperature was 98.6F. I also noticed some axial lymph node swelling as well on the Left side where I received the vaccine. Tender to touch, not too painful though. Since received the vaccine I have had intermittent dizzy spells as well all throughout the day.  I decided to go to sleep at 10:30pm and all night I tossed and turned with a headache and hot flashes. I woke up at 7:30am and was so stiff I could barely get out of bed. I called into work as I could not stand up without have dizziness. All day so far I have had dizziness upon standing, headache, myalgia, arthralgias, hot flashes/felt feverish, swollen axial lymph nodes and all I have wanted to do today is sleep. I took a nap and when I woke up I had been sleeping for 6 hours. I finally was able to get up and drink a 32ounce cup of water and take some ibuprofen. Ate some cereal. I still have a headache and dizziness upon standing that limit my ability to do normal daily functions.

The subject is in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred.  A 27-year-old female with a medical history of seasonal allergies (Mar2006 and ongoing not taking any medications to treat) who received the first dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 1) on 14Aug2020 at 10:34, second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO) (dose 2) on 04Sep2020 at 09:27. The first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) on 23Dec2020 at 09:25, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) on 11Jan2021 at 09:48. All intramuscularly in the left deltoid as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included ethinyl-estradiol/norethisterone acetate (LOESTRIN) for birth control from May2014 and ongoing. There was no family medical history relevant to AE and no concomitant vaccine administered on the same date of investigational vaccine or other prior vaccine within four weeks.  The subject experienced neuropraxia of left arm on 11Jan2021 at 09:51 considered an important medical event requiring a visit to physician office.  The clinical course was the following: At 9:51, 3 minutes after receiving the second dose of BNT162B2 in left deltoid, the subject complained of left arm numbness and tingling starting at elbow and extending to fingers, weakness, and a weak grip in that hand. She also reported a decreased range of motion on the left side including her arm, shoulder joint, elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal. Subject was afebrile with a normal vascular exam, no bruising, capillary refill time was less than 3 seconds. No antipyretic medication was administered. The investigator requested the subject to return to site the following day. On 12Jan2021, the investigator noted some improvement to symptoms but the subject was unable to return to work for several days after event. An appointment was scheduled with a neurologist for 13Jan2021. The action taken with BNT162B2 for the event was not applicable. The clinical outcome of the event was recovering.   The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event neuropraxia of left arm was related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (dose 4) and clinical trial procedure (vaccination administration in the left deltoid, investigator did consider the location was appropriate), but unrelated to first and second dose of blinded therapy (BNT162;PLACEBO), first dose of BNT162B2 (dose 3) or concomitant medications. Per investigator, it was not likely that the event was related to the investigational product (IP) itself, however, that could not be 100% determined until neurologist had evaluated the subject.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  There is a reasonable possibility for the event &#34;Nerve Injury&#34; to be related to the procedure of vaccine (BNT162B2) administration (needle trauma) rather than to the product administered. The event would not be considered a unique response to this specific vaccine (BNT162B2). The case will be reassessed upon reception of neurological advice.

                                                I woke up at 1:30am with nausea, chills, sweating, and  diarrea. I went to the bathroom and vomited, my vision started darkening. After some time sitting on the toilet I stood up to wash my hands and reach for a hair tie to put my hair up because I was sweating profusely. I felt my vision darkening again and fell to the ground. I never lost consciousness and laid on the ground for a few seconds. I felt my stomach begin to churn again so I got up and sat on the toilet and began having diarrhea again. I texted my sister to come upstairs and bring me a Tylenol and some peppermint oil for my stomach. I took 1000mg of Tylenol, rolled peppermint oil on my stomach and stayed sitting with a cold towel on my head. I was then able to stand up and go back to bed at around 3am (shortly after taking the Tylenol). The next morning I woke up at around 8:30am, still feeling fatigued and mild chills. The diarrea and nausea are gone.

I took off the bandaid and noticed the injection point was way higher than it should have been. I had redness in the area (about 1-1.5 inch diameter) too that I have a picture of to show the injection location. I have limited range of motion, severe pain, and shooting pain down the back of my arm. I am unable to use my arm or lift anything that has any weight to it.

                                                I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 9:15 am on 2/23/21. Initially, my only symptoms were injection site soreness and minor swelling. Gradually throughout the day, my entire left arm become more and more sore. By 5:00pm, I felt exhausted and dizzy and was having chills. My temperature was 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. I took a dose of Extra Strength Tylenol, but felt no change. My joints and muscles began to ache around 6:00pm on 2/23/21 and did not stop aching until around 9:00pm on 2/24/21. During the evening of 2/23/21, my dizziness increased and I felt as if I would pass out any time I sat up or stood. My temperature had returned to 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit by 10:00pm on 2/23/21. I then took a dose of Motrin to help with my soreness. On 2/24/21 from morning until 8:30pm, I had no fever or chills, but still felt exhausted and had minor muscle/joint achiness. I took 3 doses of Motrin on 2/24/21 to help with the soreness. Throughout the day, I had some difficulty breathing (felt like a mild asthma attack) and used my emergency inhaler once. At 8:30pm on 2/24/21, my temperature was 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. I took another dose of Motrin and went to sleep. Around 3:00am on 2/25/21, I woke up drenched in sweat, but feeling better. My temperature was normal then. When I woke up at 7:00am on 2/25/21, I no longer felt achy, dizzy, or tired. I still feel (now at 1:30pm on 2/25/21)as though my asthma is aggravated, but am not having difficulty breathing.

                                                Light-headness within forty five minutes - a little dizzy; tiredness; nauseous; swelling on injection site - it was a little worse then on the first dose (I forgot to mention that I had swelling on the injection site after the first dose, too). These symptoms lasted for about two weeks. I took Benadryl to help with the symptoms - it helped  the symptoms to let me to sleep. A week and a half before I took the second COVID vaccine, I had a TB test done. Exhaustion is still there and I still have nausea. Dizziness has been gone since second week of the 2nd dose of vaccine. Swelling on the injection site is gone. I had a doctor visit - Video visit with clinic and the dr recommended bedrest - February 11th or 12th - no meds given.  I&#39;m due Sept 26, 2021. This is my fourth pregnancy - I had my daughter who is eight years old; an abortion; had my son who is five and he was born pre-term due to lack of fluids in the stomach - 4 lbs 5 oz. and now this pregnancy.

                                                I was nauseous after the shot but it may have been hunger and nerves. I had itchy skin for a little bit on my face and arms. Then it went away.  I got home around six pm.  I had to go to the bathroom and first go was a mix of diarrhea and solid stools. Then as soon as I left the bathroom, I had to go back. It was fully blown diarrhea. Then I kid you not, my period came on at the same time. It is usually unpredictable but I wanted to add it just in case. And my arm became really really sore around 8pm and last night I could barely move it from the pain, or lift it. This morning it is still sore...and hurts to put pressure on .

                                                Stark dark red rash on lower left breast and abdomen.  Started 03/14/21 in the middle of the night when I was sleeping. In the morning it was still there so I took a benadryl with no relief. It became more inflamed, started itching and came with discomfort. Began feeling feverish and dizzy. Saw an NP 03/15/21 around 2:00pm and was given steroid cream to treat what she thought was an allergy.   Steroid cream and cold compresses were used over the course of the next two days with no relief. Rash seemed to get bigger and darker. The rash is 4-5  irregular, textured and raised clusters about 1-2 cm in size, with mildly erythematous areas surrounding them. Saw an MD 03/17/21 around 1:30pm, believes it&#39;s a vascular response to the vaccine as the color of the rash doesn&#39;t fade when pressed on. Advises getting a biopsy if issue does not resolve or improve after 1 week. He also advised holding off on the second dose until further information is obtained

                                                27 year old female comes in 3/27/21 at 4:15pm to get Pfizer COVID vaccine. She has no family doctor. On her VAR form she states no seizure or history of seizure but does have reaction to HPV vaccine where her throat swelled up and her MD had to give her oxygen year ago. I asked about any other reactions to any other vaccinations and she said no and was willing to get this vaccine.  I told her to wait 30 minutes after vaccination to make sure no reaction. At 4:25pm her sister and mom tell us that patient is feeling week and dizzy and ask for water, I go out and check and she is pale and is ready to faint. Mother asks for orange juice which she takes a sip. I ask her if she has any health conditions like diabetes, seizures and they say no, then patient has what looks like a petit mal (absence) seizure. While sitting in the chair her eyes flutter, roll back she tenses up and her body freezes for about 20-30 seconds. I tell staff to call 911 and her sister says she&#39;s having &#34;another&#34; seizure. We don&#39;t move her but make sure she doesn&#39;t fall, once the seizure passes we move her to the ground to lie down. She regains consciousness and is coherent but confused. I do not give EpiPen because I witnessed a seizure. The fire and ambulance arrive to assist her and then her family mentions she did have seizures years ago. After 20 minutes or around 4:50pm she feels better and does not want to go to the hospital and walks out assisted by fire/ambulance staff. The next day I call her and she says she feels better and just has a sore arm and will find new doctor check her out.

                                                Day of administration around 2100 I started feeling a little off, got a little bit of a headache and felt warm. While sleeping I could feel that I had chills and felt very warm. Woke up at about 0200 to take my temperature. Felt dizzy when I got up, still had a headache and a fever of 101.0 (taken orally). Contacted a nurse triage line to ensure I can take t=Tylenol to bring the fever down and get rid of the headache. She said yes, which is when I took 500mg Extra Strength Tylenol rapid release. Continued to feel not so well, and broke my fever around 0630 timeframe. Once I woke up around 0900 (day after administration) still felt a little warm  (99.5)  and a mild headache. Will keep an eye on any other adverse reactions.

(I working in the ER and did not feel it was severe enough to check in because the shortness of breath was mild and went away shortly after the dizziness began at 1815).

                                                I was awoken from sleep with violent chills and an sensation of severe cold. My chills became violent and coarse rigors, severe enough to contract the spine into hyperextension if I kept my body in a neutral position. I could still activate each muscle group to keep in a fetal prostration pose. I was knowledgeable of the event, did not loose any bowel, bladder, or smooth muscle function, and the intensity of the rigors was focused on the most developed skeletal muscles (thighs, calves, upper arms, forearms, paraspinal muscles, hands, respectively).  Jaw and muscles of the head/face seemed unaffected. Fingers and toes not distinctly affected. I was not sweating at this time and there were NO other symptoms to report; I remained lucid and able to self-reflect the entire time. Home temperature is kept to consistent 66F, no malfunctions to thermostat. No recent changes to bedding (sheet and quit on top of mattress); it is even optimized for me as I tend to overheat as I sleep.   At 50 minutes, I felt &#34;less frozen&#34; and confident enough to stand/ambulate for 220mg naproxen &#43; 500mg APAP , cautiously and successfully swallowed. Robe was donned over existing pajamas and thick comforter was pulled from hallway closet. Rigors continued, but it appeared that intentional activation of the muscle groups could still overpower the rigors for safe (but shaky) ambulation. Greatest risk was coarsely shaking hands a bringing cup to mouth to swallow pills.   Above activity was completed in 5 minutes. I then sat upright in bed under layers above. I could feel the muscles calm and relax, with episode completely ending in 5 minutes. Total time of event: 60 minutes.   Post-event details: There was a mild sensation of muscle tension in the posterior cervical spine akin to whiplash, but no residual symptoms. I debriefed with my husband shortly thereafter (he has been in another room the whole time) and fell asleep by 23:30. Awoke to alarm at 05:00 and able to stretch, accomplish 30 min run, vacuum/mop the floors, and present to work by 08:00am without deficit.  Time of documentation: 11:22 am 1/15/2021

This 28-year-old female nurse (patient) reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3246) at single dose at left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation on 11Jan2021 at 4:30 pm. Relevant history included contraception. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was none. Concomitant drug included ongoing ethinylestradiol, etonogestrel (NUVARING) for contraception for years. The patient experienced a headache, back ache, nausea and was almost passing out. She had the first dose of the vaccine on the 11Jan2021 at 4:30 PM and was in bed around 10:00 that night.  She woke up at 5:00 AM on 12Jan2021 and didn&#39;t feel great, her arm was killing her more than a normal vaccine and she was nauseated at 5:30, which was not that horrible. She took some Tylenol. Then she got to work and around 9:00 she felt like she was going to get sick. She had horrendous nausea, chills, weakness, eye pain, headache/ head pain, and back pain. Her clothes hurt because the body aches were so bad. She felt like she was going to pass out, like a vasovagal. She went to urgent care because her manager didn&#39;t think it was side effect. She went and got swabbed (result unknown), whatever. She had a fever then. They told her it was a reaction to the vaccine. Her temperature was 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit when she went to Urgent care. She would say the fever started at 12:30PM on 12Jan2021. She did not know if fever would be ongoing because she was taking fever reducer and it was working. The events weakness, eye pain, head pain, and back pain were reported as serious since medically significant. The nausea was better around 2:00PM. The outcome of event nausea, Chills was and Weakness was resolved on 12Jan2021.  The outcome of events eye pain, head pain, and back pain was resolving. The outcome of event &#39;her arm was killing her more than a normal vaccine&#39; was recovering. The outcome of fever was unknown. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was none.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events, weakness, eye pain, head pain, and back pain, and the administration the suspect vaccine, BNT162B2.

I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

                                                After my 2nd dose administration, I sat in an observation tent with 4 resident doctors. This is protocol at my hospital to assess for any adverse reactios. About 10 minutes later, I started to feel both of my arms (from should all the way to tips of my fingers) start to get tingly with an intense vibrating sensation. I tried to calm myself down, however numbness began to occur to both BUE seconds after. Next thing that happened, bilateral fingers became visually contracted however numb and I could not move my fingers. I also got a tingly/prickly sensation to my cheeks all the way down to my chin after the hand numbess. The resident doctors quickly took me by wheelchair to a private room where they checked my vital signs. BP was elevated with systolic in 190&#39;s, HR around 120s, and my limbs were all cold. By this time it was around 6pm and they were trying to calm me down as I started to have a panic attack. My parents came to pick me up at 7pm when my vitals were stable. I rested at home, and the contraction to my fingers/numbess did not subside until 8:30pm.  The following day, my left arm (injection site) had a soreness level of 9/10. Tylenol was used to relieve pain.

A 28-years-old female patient received dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 28Jan2021 10:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), asthma (mild), PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), anxiety, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), allergy to egg whites, allergy to bee stings and diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination.

The patient previously took escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) and experienced Allergy to lexapro, sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) and experienced Allergy to Zoloft, quetiapine fumarate (SEROQUEL) and experienced Allergy to seroquel, erythromycin and experienced Allergy to erythromycin. On 28Jan2021, the patient experienced fatigue throughout the day increased. The patient developed headache. Awoke around 28Jan2021 23:00 with aches, chills, severe headache, weakness, dizziness, and nausea.

She likely would have went to the ER for help but she couldn&#39;t have driven herself and her kids were home. She did not want to call 911. On 28Jan2021 23:00, she did experience an episode of nearly passing out sometime during the night when she attempted to sit up on the edge of the bed to take some Tylenol. She could not regulate her temperature as she fluctuated between being diaphoretic and cold to being overheated. In the morning she finally felt well enough to go to her medicine cabinet downstairs and decided to essentially sedate herself for the day with Benadryl, Xanax, zofran, Tylenol, and ibuprofen. She then slept from about 10am until about 5pm. She felt considerably better upon waking up, with just fatigue, nausea, and headache. The report was reported as non-serious. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not pregnant. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events fatigue, nausea and headache was not resolved and the outcome of the other events was resolving.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested

When smiling one side trip the far far left the other side stay still. My job had me go to a doctors up where they diagnosed me with Bell?s palsy it and the doctor advised me to report this. My treatment plan is antiviral medication and steroids, Valacyclovir 1gm tid, methylprednisolone 4grams qid. I am very upset and heartbroken every time I look in the mirror I cry because I cannot recognize my face I did read online that Pfizer did have side effects of bells palsy but I never thought I would get it given my age and good medical history. I would love for someone to reach out to me I need to know what happens from here.   As a result I have been off of work for a couple days.

                                                3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt a sense of panic and a tingling on my lips, that then spread to my mouth, throat, and tongue. I asked the nurse if my lips were swollen, and she said no.  A few minutes later my heart rate increased and I felt really lightheaded. After 7-10 minutes I felt my tongue tingling and it had become swollen. I told the nurse that I think my tongue was swollen and she said it looked okay. I had a hard time talking because I wasn&#39;t used to be tongue being so large. The nurses stayed and talked to me for the rest of the 30 minute waiting period. I was able to talk and breath while making a conscious effort.  I wasn&#39;t sure whether the high heart rate and lightheadedness were associated with my condition, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. I kept checking my tongue to see how swollen it was.  After the 30 minutes, the nurses had me stand up to see if I could. Once I could, they said I was all set to go. They did not get an Epi-pen for the swollen tongue or give me instructions on how to treat it. They were insensitive and dismissive of my symptoms. they kept repeating &#34;I think your just nervous.&#34; Once I got home, I still had the swollen tongue and tingling, but was able to go up and down stairs and go about my day. It was a little difficult to swallow one of my pills when I got home, but I was able to. I checked my blood pressure around 4:30 p.m. and it was 121/84 and my pulse was 79 bpm sitting. I did not take anything to treat my swollen tongue. The swollen tongue and tingling feeling in my throat continued for another 2.5 hours, until 6:00 p.m. Once the swelling was down, my tongue felt like I burnt it on a hot beverage, almost a numb feeling. I also experienced more common side effects such as body aches, fatigue, and feeling feverish.   After this episode I had extremely high anxiety where it was difficult for me to sleep the following night. I called a 24/7 nurse line and she said to talk to my doctor. I had less than 4 hours sleep the night after I had my vaccine.  I called my doctor&#39;s office this morning and I spoke to a nurse who worked as a nurse on the COVID Vaccine hotline.  She relayed the message to the doctor who was covering for my doctor while she&#39;s on medical leave. I received a call around 9:30 a.m. saying that the doctor on leave recommend I should talk to my PCP but that she thought I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and that I should not get the second dose. She said they were not sure how I would react with the second dose, and they&#39;re afraid that my allergic response might be more severe and life threatening.  I hope this report helps other people who experience these symptoms.

                                                Patient went to discharge and on standing, felt lightheaded with leg &amp; hand weakness.  She complained of chills and nausea and a sensation beginning from her upper arms/shoulders and spreading through to her torso and upper legs. It lasted about 5-10 seconds. She sat down immediately. She was always alert and coherent. Skin was warm and dry. Vital signs:  BP = 120/80, P=60, T=98.6, R=18 and regular. She stated she had not eaten breakfast and had only had a cup of coffee all morning. Her symptoms lasted a few minutes. She was given lunch to eat and felt better immediately. It was recommended she contact her doctor/clinic and she said she would do that.  She returned to her classroom at 12:15 pm. Follow-up call today (3/4/21) - she stated she had no more symptoms and was feeling well overall.

Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

A 28-year-old non-pregnant female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Feb2021 15:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, migraines, asthma, hay fever, acid reflux, hives when exercising outdoors in the cold, and allergies: latex, cats, dustmites, gluten and dairy intolerance; all from unknown dates. Concomitant medications included sumatriptan, bupropion, pepsin, calcium carbonate and unspecified herbs. The patient did not received other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took fluconazole (DIFLUCAN) and experienced allergies. A few minutes after taking the vaccine, the patient experienced a tingling feeling in lips, which then spread to mouth, throat and tongue. The patient told a nurse and she said that she looked fine. The patient asked if lips were swollen but they weren&#39;t. Then a few minutes later she felt very lightheaded and had an elevated heart rate. Then around this time, she saw her tongue was swollen to about double the size. The nurse said she looked fine, and monitored her for 30 minutes then let her go. This swollen tongue lasted for about 2.5 - 3 hours. After the swelling subsided, tongue felt like it was numb/burnt by drinking a hot liquid. 12 hours later, she woke up in the middle of the night with an elevated heart rate and had trouble sleeping. The patient spoke to her doctor and it sounds like she had an allergic reaction, even though she have no history of allergies for any of the vaccine ingredients. Onset date of all events were reported as 25Feb2021 15:30. Outcome of all events reported as recovered on an unspecified date. No treatment was given for all events. The patient was not diagnosed of covid prior vaccination and has not tested for covid post vaccination.

A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 05Mar2021 08:00 as a single dose (at the age of 28-years-old) for Covid-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included epilepsy, hypopituitarism, central diabetes insipidus, neoplasm of brain, irregular menses, short-term memory loss, elevated LDL, and myopia w/ astigmatism. The patient had known allergies to surgical tape and contrast dyes. Concomitant medications included desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), lamotrigine (LAMICTAL), levetiracetam, and zonisamide; all were taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced drug allergy. On 08Mar2021 at 06:15 PM, the patient experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizure, feeling unwell, slightly nauseous, still a little slow in speech and gait. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of generalized tonic-clonic seizure, feeling unwell, slightly nauseous, still a little slow in speech and gait as Nayzilam 5 mg two doses was administered. Clinical course details as reported: the patient finished dinner and evening medications before 6 pm and started feeling unwell and slightly nauseous soon after. Laid on sofa, started to sit up at 6:20 pm, and went into a Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure. The patient&#39;s father administered Nayzilam 5 mg (2 doses); seizure ended and the patient went into a deep sleep until 8:00 pm. The patient was largely recovered, but still a little slow in speech and gait. The outcome of the events was recovering as reported.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                3/18: Chest pain. It woke me up in the middle of the night with some dizziness. At first, I disregarded it, then I tried falling asleep again, but I was jolted awake again with worse symptoms - vertigo, palpitations. I measured my HR, it was all over the place and irregular. Went to the ER, they didnt find anything substantial on my EKG other than arrhythmia with short PR. No treatment was given, instructed to follow up with PCP. Left ER between 4AM-5AM. Was able to go back to sleep, but the chest pain woke me up around 7 AM. The chest pain remained fairly constant with severity changing throughout the day. Symptoms were worse at night and more: inability to sleep, sometimes restlessness - the need to move, increased chest pain/tightness/burning, palpitations. Saw PCP on 3/19, she didnt have any of the lab results, but prescribed metoprolol - this medication was misunderstood as to when I was supposed to take it, therefore didnt start it until another visit that I had with my PCP on 3/22. Over the weekend, I took some ibuprofen to try to lessen the chest pain, it helped a little bit but not for long. Began taking metoprolol 3/22. I didnt sleep more than 2-3 hrs from 3/18-3/22

We told her to sit down and try to stay calm and we took her blood pressure. Blood pressure was 171/134 and her resting heart rate was 156 bpm. We told her to take some deep breaths and wait 5 minutes. We took it again, it was still high, hypertensive crisis level and heart rate was still elevated in the 120s. We took another pharmacists blood pressure to make sure monitor was accurate and it was normal/accurate. The patient refused to go to the ER even though she was strongly advised to.

Woke up at 2:00am uncontrollably shaking with chills/goosebumps, sweating with shortness of breath. Extreme headache and all over body soreness also at that time.  This continued in waves for the next several hours. I finally slept for a short time and woke with continued headache and muscle/joint soreness. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea and decreased appetite. This persisted throughout the entire next day following vaccination. The day after that was slightly better and the subsequent day I felt relatively back to normal.  I checked for fever many times throughout the symptoms but was always afebrile.

                                                1/8/21 - 15 minutes after second dose of COVID19 vaccine I had flushing (warm rash like) all over my chest and neck that lasted for about an hour. No itching or hives. 1/9/21 at 3am my heart rate started to increase to about 110bpm while sleeping and continued till 4am. 1/9/21 at 4am my apple watch alerted me to my heart rate was above 120bpm while resting. This is when I realized I was sweating and felt like I had a fever.  I drank water and went back to sleep. 1/9/21 5am heart rate was at 135. then 6am 148bpm. 7am around 161bpm. Kept trying to go back to sleep. 1/9/21 8am got up and took an adult benadryl tablet and drank plenty of water. Tried to relax to lower my heart rate.  1/9/21 9am took another adult benadryl tablet and was able to get my heart rate just below 120 while sitting. Then ate breakfast and went back to bed. If heart rate was not going to lower, I was planning on going to the ER. 1/9/21 10am till next day. Heart rate was then under 100bpm. I was then so tired that I slept all day and did not eat anything else.  1/10 I experienced severe body aches, chills and headache. This was all day. 1/11 I woke up feeling mildly nauseous for about 3 hours and then dizzy for about an hour. after that I just had a sore arm. 1/12 Had a mildly sore arm.

                                                1 week history of significantly worsened (previously present &#34;low back strain&#34; lower back pain that had become radicular to both LE and associated with progressively worsening bilateral LE weakness, paresthesias since COVID vaccination last week. see continuation for HPI and assessment/plan from office note 1/13/21  HPI from OV dated 1/13/21  She had presented initially in December 2020 for her annual physical, and we evaluated some low back pain that that time, felt to be a sprain/strain resulting from a fall in the shower earlier December which was aggravated significantly by lifting/transferring a patient at the SNF she works for as a nurse. Presentation at that time was rather benign, no imaging obtained, pt was placed on leave from work for 1 week to avoid the heavy lifting and likely aggravation of back pain, and rx including diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine. She did not FU in the office, but returned to work at SNF a week after I saw her for the back pain. She states she had improved enough to feel like she could go back to work but wasn&#39;t 100% without back pain yet. At no time was comp mentioned at the visit in December. She did tell her employer about the injury and was off of work for a week and was encouraged to seek comp. We were never notified.    Yesterday 1/12 she followed up in the office for the back pain and was found to have much more severe pain, now radicular to both LE (pain intensity worse on right), with new neurologic impairment including objective weakness bilateral LE (R&gt;L), sensation disturbance bilateral LE (R&gt;L). Xray of lumbar spine obtained in clinic, this was essentially unremarkable, non-acute.  Pt was sent for stat MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI last night revealed no findings to explain her severe symptoms - she has mild symmetric disc bulging at L5-S1  nd mild bilateral facet arthropathy with patent canal and foramina, and a mild nonspecific  &#34;STIR signal abnormality&#34; within the soft tissues abutting the left lateral aspect of the L5 spinous processes felt to be small and nonspecific. I did discuss the case and the imaging with the radiologist and he feels this is unlikely to be the source of her back pain/radicular symptoms. No obvious signs of apparent discitis or any signficant soft tissue abnormality.    Pt contacted last night with initial &#34;normal&#34; results of MRI as formal results were pending - hydrocodone was sent to her pharmacy for pain relief overnight. Pt received 60mg toradol in the office yesterday during her visit. Pt noted significant improvement in her back pain, bilateral leg pain about 30 minuts after that injection. She continued to have pain in the evening but went to sleep. She woke at 3am unable to roll over due to weakness and pain - her sister gave her a hydrocodone and she went back to sleep&#39; she woke this morning feeling much better; today, she has less severe low back pain, less severe right lower leg radicular pain, NO pain radiating into the left LE, lessening of the weakness in her right LE, lessening of paresthesia reported in the right LE (now isolated just to the heel), resolution of the weakness in the left LE, resolution of the tingling of the left knee. Other than the toradol and one dose of hydrocodone, no other medications were given, no other treatments given since presentation yesterday.   Upon further questioning, patient does reveal that she received the 1st of 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (pfizer) last week. She received the vaccination at work at nursing home on 1/7/21. She had some relatively quick onset nausea and dizziness within an hour of the injection, but that resolved. She recalls feeling like her low back pain, bilateral lower leg pain, leg weakness and paresthesias all intensified sometime either Wednesday 1/6/21 or 1/7/21, but more obviously worsened over the weekend 1/9 and 1/10. Along with the lower extremity symptoms, she does admit today that she experienced soreness in bilateral upper arms starting the day following the vaccine administration, with left arm/shoulder still feeling sore and tender to the touch now. She also developed some altered sensation of the right thumb and index fingers the day following vaccination (1/8/21) and this has been persistent/unchanged. She is right handed. No prior issues with right hand/fingers. Other than the altered sensation, she denies pain, swelling, or notable weakness. She is right handed, and really hasn&#39;t done much with her right hand over the past week since she hasn&#39;t been working. Patient denies having significant headache, fever, chills, diaphoresis, fatigue, rashes/injection site erythema since the covid vaccination. She was not told to sign up for or told about the V-safe program and hadn&#39;t thought to report her symptoms to work or think to be concerned regarding possible vaccine SE. Pt denies prior hx of low back pain, neurologic symptoms including weakness/paresthesias, previous allergy to or adverse reaction to vaccination or injectable medications. She has a history of latent TB(fully treated) but is otherwise in good health.  After gathering much further detailed information/history today from patient, review of chart including the MRI results and xray results from yesterday, my prior OV note, and discussion with radiologist today regarding her MRI - I Discussed with patient and her sister that I believe what is becoming more apparent to me now is that she is likely suffering from an adverse event associated with the COVID-19 vaccination she received on 1/7/21 through her workplace. I&#39;m unable to define this for certain, but I suspect that she developed the progressive worsening of low back pain, development of radicular pain and bilateral LE weakness and paresthesias about 1-2 days following the vaccination administration. She has had notable and rather surprising improvement in both subjective and objective findings  Today as compared to yesterday. Only intervention was toradol 60mg IM and one dose of hydrocodone, she had already been taking diclofenac or ibuprofen so I believe the only explanation for the improvement over the past 24 hours is the fact that she is gradually having resolution of the temporary paraparesis, neuralgia, paresthesia brought on by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. I believe she truly had injury to the low back in December, initial injury at home but had improvmenet and then significant worsening/exacerbation when transferring a resident at work. Her presentation following that was consistent with a strain/sprain of the lumbar spine. This was treated appropriately with rest, activity modification, stretching, NSAID, and muscle relaxers. She returned to work w/o restriction likely earlier than she should have but I believe the covid vaccination is likely what caused her condition to so significantly decline; Its also possible that her physically demanding job requiring lifting/transferring/standing for prolonged periods of time on top of an only partially resolved low back strain had aggravated her low back condition.    plan from OV dated 1/13/21 Given the improvement since yesterday, I recommended obtaining some labs looking for any sign of alternative explanation including infectious etiology or autoimmune/inflammatory condition, however will hold on further imaging as would be the plan, specifically EMG of the bilateral LEs. Explained to patient that I&#39;m hopeful with continued rest and time, her symptoms (weakness, tingling/numbness, radicular back pain) will completely resolve. She may need some eventual PT for the disc bulge in the lumbar spine and lumbar strain that is likely still lingering. Will contact pt with any change in care plan based on the laboratory findings. I would like to closely follow her, and make sure her symptoms continue to slowly improve /resolve. If at any point she develops worsening symptoms again or any new neurologic signs/symptoms (and we discussed what emergency signs/symptoms would be) then she needs to be in touch with me right away. I will work on reporting this suspected adverse covid vaccine reaction to VAERS / possibly also CDC and see if they have any additional input/suggestions for monitoring/treatment.    For pain control, pt may continue with the diclofenac OR ibuprofen, and the hydrococone/APAP as needed for breakthrough severe pain uncontrolled with the NSAID. I have advised pt to remain off of work at this time, resting at home avoiding lots of physical activity as she continues to heal. Suspect will have her follow up in clinic sometime next week for repeat evaluation/examination depending on VAERS/CDC recommendations and of course the lab results and any updated condition reports from the patient in the interim. Will want to make sure she has full resolution of the paresis and adequate resolution of her back pain/radicular pain prior to returning to work, even in a limited capacity. I am informed today that there is light duty available and will keep that in mind. Pt to be contacted regarding follow up. Encouraged to call with questions/concerns/updates. Pt was very thankful for the care.

Two separate instances of this pain, one on 1/18/21 at 1600-1730, and one on 1/18/21 2230-0000.  The second instance the pain was so severe, lead to nausea and one episode of emesis. Initially trialed treatment with antacids but that did nothing to improve the pain. Evaluation by MD on 1/19 at 1300 diagnosed with pleuritic pain secondary to inflammation. No prior history of this, no cardiac history, and no history of GERD.  Other post vaccination symptoms included fever approx 10 hours following the vaccine, nausea, one episode of diarrhea, fatigue, body achs, dizziness, and chills, all of which resolved by 1/18 at 1100am.

                                                Second dose of COVID vaccine (Pfzier/BioNTech) received Friday morning around 8:00, I left work about an hour early that day due to rising nausea, migraine and fatigue. By the time I got to my car in the parking garage I had thrown up and was so dizzy that I called my boyfriend to come pick me up. When I got home I immediately laid down to take a nap. 3 hours later I woke up very sore and achy and still had a migraine. I remained in bed and later that night I spiked a fever as high as 101.8 fahrenheit. I had severe chills and the aches were so bad that my bones hurt all over and it felt like someone was stabbing me with a metal broom handle. Pain spiked to 8 on the pain scale and with the length of time I had this pain, it was one of the worst experiences of my life. The dizziness and fatigue caused me to need help to get out of bed to use the restroom. I took ibuprofen frequently and Nyquil at night to help relieve the effects without it doing little more than taking the edge off. Saturday night was the same as Friday night with no relief of symptoms. Fever remained around 100.9. Sunday night it dropped to 99.8 with chills, dizziness and fatigue still remaining but aches slightly lessening. Monday night I was still dizzy and weak but not nearly as in much pain and fever had subsided. Tuesday I started to feel more normal by the end of the night, just easily out of breath and off and on again headache.

Extremely uncomfortable, from neck to back to calves, without improvement with Tylenol or ibuprofen, causing me to be unable to sleep. Around hour 20 post-vaccine, I started to get chills. It wasn?t just feeling cold or shivering, it was full body convulsions that lasted approximately 15 minutes.  I became nauseas and dizzy after that for about an hour, unable to stand or walk anywhere. The severe body aches continued, with no improvement from Tylenol or ibuprofen or heating pad. Aches resolved around hour 30 post-vaccine and the only symptom left was pain at the injection site.

                                                Vaccine administered too high in right arm by CP.  At time of administration pt felt severe burning and pain at and around right shoulder joint.  After vaccine administered there was hardly any R upper arm muscle pain noted. All pain was located in the right shoulder joint 9/10. Pt unable to move or use R arm/shoulder for approximately 3 days post injection. Heat applied several times a day, arm/shoulder rested and ibuprofen 800mg taken every 6 hours. Small range of motion exercises attempted to help alleviate stiffening. Approximately 4 days post injection- very small range of motion returned 25% of baseline- still unable to use right shoulder to complete daily tasks, pain 7/10 in right shoulder joint. Pt continued to use heat, rest and ibuprofen 800mg.   No muscle pain noted in right upper arm. As of 1/19/20- range of motion about 50% in right shoulder, pt has clicking and popping in right shoulder joint with all movement. Pain 5/10 in right shoulder joint with movement. Pt unable to lift object more than approximately 3lbs. Ibuprofen 800mg still taken PRN pain, heat still applied PRN.  All symptoms reported in Vsafe app following injection. 1/19/21 Notified hospital through COVID question hotline- RN charted problem in pts medical record.  Pt concerned because there is not a significant improvement 10 days post injection. Also due to the lack of information about adverse events of the Pfizer COIVD 19 vaccine.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine I began to feel a little dizzy, tired, and started to develop a headache.  By the next day my headache became overwhelming and the the dizziness became so pronounced that I could not stand for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I a had an intolerable headache on the entire bottom of my head that made my neck start to hurt.   I felt nausea that did not improve until four days later. My joints were hurting sharply  two days after the immunization and lasted two days.    Most of my symptoms improved on the 13th of January, but were still lingering.  About 5 days after the shot my symptoms resolved completely.

I then was speaking with management and felt faint and short of breath, continued to be tingly.  Last night 1/19/21 I had a moment of not feeling well and my heart rate went from 60s to 120s with shortness of breath and nausea qnd tingling. This continued for about 30 minutes, I was debating going to the ED for the SOB. I then became really cold and had such bad shaking I couldn&#39;t hold anything for another 20 minutes.  Today I continue to have some tingling. All of this on top of the expected side effects.

I was also extremely fatigued and found it difficult to get out of bed or off of the couch. I had a severe headache that lasted the majority of the day. Thursday&#39;s are typically my day off therefore I did not have to call out of work sick, however I most likely would have if I had been scheduled that day.

                                                First Dose-  I had a headache after the shot and tremors started that even and throughout the night. No fevor. Arm very sore, going into neck.   Second Dose-  Felt find the night. Woke up that morning at 1am and with tremors and in a night sweat. Checked temp and it was only 96, but felt hot and was sweating. Woke up the next morning and my entire body, muscles and joints ached. My knuckles, ached, kept getting sharp pains in my knuckles. My jaw ached, difficulty eating. My entire body, my muscle ached, difficulty moving. I didn&#39;t get a headache till that evening. I also had severe heart burn that night, not sure if it was related, but I have never had heart burn that bad. The next morning when I woke up (5am) (now two days after my shot), again my joints hurts, I couldn&#39;t even stand.  Its like my knees couldn&#39;t even support me and I had a massive headache.  I went back to bed and woke around 9am, no longer had a headache, muscles still hurt. Around 11am, all of a sudden, muscles and joints felt fine.   The only thing (day three) is my arm pit on my left side where i got the shot is bothering my extremely bad.  I was able to put an ultrasound probe on my axilla area, and I have swollen lymph nodes in my axilla in the area that is very painful. I also have a dull pain in my elbow.

The patient has no other medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient stated that she got the first shot for the covid vaccine yesterday in the evening and now she is feeling swelling on the face.

Suddenly, I passed out and hit my head and upper neck on the tile floor.  My parents heard the sound of my fall and luckily rushed to the bathroom.  They found me lying  unconscious on the floor with my eyes rolled up for what felt like more than a minute.  I regained consciousness on my own, and I drank water with a bit of sugar and salt mixed in.    I felt too weak to get up and walk, and the back of my head and upper neck were in pain.  I told my parents to call 911 as I wanted to make sure that there was no serious damage to my brain or neck area.  I went to the local hospital in an ambulance.

Almost immediatly afte,r I got a sharp shooting inside nerve pain from shoulder under the armpit area down to my wrist area.  The pain was bad and constant until 1/14, aleve, ibuprophen or tylenol made it better.  On 1/10-1/11 the pain was the worst and woke me up from sleeping it hurt so bad with a pain level of  a 8/10.  The pain was more nerve pain over muscle pain and the intensity never changed  whether I moved or not.

Received vaccine at 9:15 AM.  She initially felt well, but about 20-30 minutes after administration began to feel dizzy.  Then had nausea, vomiting, dizziness, severe headache, feeling of her body being heavy, arm pain at site of administration.  Vitals were monitored/stable throughout. Pt was given Zofran 4 mg disintegrating tab at 9:50, which did not do much to relieve sx.  However, at 10:35 she noted that headache was gone, although still had dizziness, arm pain.   By 11:08 no longer had symptoms except for arm pain.  By 11:43 still feeling back to normal except for arm pain.

                                                Eight days after I received the first dose I experienced redness and swelling around the injection site. It continued to get larger over the next two days, measuring 4 inches in diameter. It was associated with mild pruritis. There was diffuse swelling of the area but no discrete fluid collection. I couldn&#39;t lift my left arm above shoulder height by the end of the second day. After discussion with our infectious disease doctor and an internist we decided that since the area had continued to get larger that I should have a steroid injection. I received 40mg IM solumedrol two days after it appeared and it markedly improved 6 hours later with resolution of symptoms about 24 hours later.

                                                The muscle around the injection site was very stiff shortly after the injection. No pain to touch around injection site. On 3/6/21 I started experiencing  slight pain in my axillary region. Pain was probably 3 of 10. Stayed at this pain level until 3/8, when it started to increase and to date pain is increasing and there is a large lump in my under my arm. Lifting my arm above my shoulder increases pain. Pain also wraps around to my shoulder area. I have never had any pain in or around this region until after the vaccine.

                                                Severe brain fog, and has continued from within 24 hours on and off.  Today is day 6 and it is still continuing on and off. Makes working as a teacher extremely difficult. Feel like I can&#39;t think clearly, can&#39;t think deeply or critically, and feel like I am &#34;out of it&#34; or not speaking as coherently.  Can&#39;t find words or organize my thoughts properly. Have also had some light headed and dizziness a few times since then.

Following morning, there was sharp pain at the injection site and I was unable to lift my arm at all. In the evening I can lift it half way. Still experiencing 32 hours later: headache and brain fog and dissociated feeling, fatigue, and body aches. Neck remains stiff. Never had any adverse or allergic reaction to anything before and didn&#39;t become fully aware that something wasn&#39;t right until after I left the facility yesterday.

She did note a sensation of tingling/numbness in her lips after sitting down outside  There were no signs of labial edema or edema of the airway.  Patient was given cold water and 25mg po Benadryl with improvement in symptoms 25 minutes later.  After her extended observation period patient was released from the vaccine site with strict follow up precautions.

                                                I was 21 weeks pregnant at the time. I experienced a brief episode of vertigo on 1/28/2021, and had a return of the vertigo on 2/4/2021 that lasted all day.  I called my OBGYN thinking it could be pregnancy-related, and was referred to OB triage for monitoring and treatment with IV fluids and Zofran. I made another trip to OB triage on 4/8/2021 for the same reason. The symptoms would fluctuate in severity but never let up, and I?m still dealing with episodes of dizziness to this day. I?ve seen specialists including a neurologist, ENT specialist, audiologist, and am currently in weekly vestibular therapy for my symptoms. Ultimately, I?ve been given a differential diagnosis of vestibular neuritis vs vestibular migraine. I may have been experiencing BPPV when the symptoms began, as well. A neurologist I work closely with believes the symptoms I?ve experienced could be relayed to the COVID-19 vaccine (2nd dose was received on 1/22/2021).

                                                Everything started on January 24th at about 7pm exactly 20 days post first Pfizer vaccine. No other changes or vaccines given since October (flu vaccine) was scheduled for 1/25/21 for second Pfizer dose. It all started when I was working at ER when I started to feel cold like it was in an ice bath and numbness in both feet. I went to discharge my patients when I realized ascending numbness and coldness from the feet was traveling upward. Within 5 hours (around midnight) I went to hospital due to having severe weakness to where I couldn?t walk and loss of bladder control. I was rushed to MRI of brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. I also had blood work done and a lumbar puncture. I was admitted for a couple days to watching the ascending weakness and loss of feeling. My MRIs came back clear from any diseases such as transverse myelitis, MS, etc. My LP showed mild elevated protein at 54 (normal range 15-45), one tube elevated lymphocytes 100% (range 40-80%) and one tube elevated monocytes 50% (range 15-45%). Also CK-MB w/reflex was 352 (range 26-140). I was discharged on 2/26 at 5:30pm with a diagnosis of bilateral leg weakness and numbness. From this point on I was wheelchair bound at home and being cared for 24/7. After discharge some additional random symptoms started such as chills with no fever to where I slept in sweat pants and sweat shirts, leg spasms/ twitches, leg heaviness, severe lower back and hip pain, a loss of sensation while going pee or poo but not incontinent, and things like drop foot with the severe weakness and numbness . On 2/3/22 I started with double vision, blurry vision and pain behind my right eye. I went to ER and had repeat MRIs of brain, cervical, thoracic and lumbar with and without contrast and basic blood work and was sent home to follow up with Dr. on 2/9 and was discharged home. By 2/8 my strength started to get worse to where I couldn?t lift my kids. Finally saw Dr. neurology and MS specialist 2/9, he ran detailed neuro exams from head to toe, looked at both scans from both hospitals, all the blood work and LP results. He reported that I had severe hyper reflexes in both legs and Hoffman?s sign in both hands. My feet were completely numb and cold to where I couldn?t feel them or walk. Literally felt like everyday I was standing in a ice cold bath with no feeling of touch hot or cold sensation or pin pricks. He realized my loss of sensation was from my bra line down and included tingling in my hands and weakness in my arms. I was able to get up for the first time with a walker and take a few steps with assistance at this time. He then sent me to ER to be admitted and see their neuromuscular team to get further treatment. Upon arrival via wheelchair I was brought back to see the ER Doctor and re-did a neuro exam, some blood work and contacted the neurology team to come see me. I was then admitted to the hospital step down ICU under Dr with strict monitoring. On 2/10/21 The neuro team ordered another set of MRI of brain, cervical and thoracic with and without contrast due to a change in condition again since my last visit to hospital. They reviewed and compared studies with no changes. They scheduled me for MRI lumbar on 2/11/21 with and without contrast which came back no changes from previous MRI as well as another LP which everything that was off before was now normal. Everyday I would work with PT, OT and speech. I had no changes in speech and slowly got some strength back, and was able walk using a walker. I was then discharged home on 2/13 mid afternoon and was told I would do home health and follow up with their neurologist and Neuromusclar team once everything was resulted back. On 2/19/21 I saw my primary doctors office (nurse practitioner) where she checked up on the status of me, took me officially off work and on state disability, filled out paperwork for work and a handicapped pass. On 2/25/21 followed up with neurology, and discussed all my imaging and blood work. All CSF fluid came back normal, all labs were fine and wanted me to get an EMG to look for nerve damage. She also wanted a follow up with cardiology as my resting heart rate was 110-120 and would spike to 160s. On 3/1/21 Home health was started for physical therapy for strengthening and working on sensation for both legs. At this point I had almost full strength in my arms, still tingling in my hands and constant numbness and cold feeling in both feet and knees with severe sensitivity to cold, wind or touch on my legs. I had Home health twice a week every week for 2-3 weeks then started outpatient physical therapy which has been twice a week for 1.5 hours. On 3/5 I saw cardiology and was placed on a holt monitor for 48 hour monitoring. On 3/9 I had my EMG with Dr. and had a follow up with Dr. for 35 tubes of blood he had drawn for multiple diseases which both blood work and EMG came back negative. On 3/16 symptoms started to change from numbness to severe hypersensitivity to touch, severe shooting nerve pains, burning sensations, non stop tingling in hands, issues with temperatures either hot or cold, and swelling of both legs. On 3/17 I saw rheumatology that looked into everything said it was not lupus related as none of my inflammatory markers or lupus DNA strands were elevated and no lupus symptoms like rashes, ulcers in the mouth or tongue, hair loss or joint pain. He ordered more blood work and confirmed it was not a lupus flare up. He suggested doing a small nerve fiber biopsies. On 3/19/21 saw spinal orthopedics who reassured it has nothing to do with my spine, prescribed gabapentin for all the nerve pain and told me that neurology is who should be following me. On 3/26 I had an echocardiogram done due to the leg swelling and heart rates which came back negative for any heart problems and was told since the tachycardia is getting better to just continue watching it and was prescribed trazodone 25mg to help with sleep due to severe nerve pains, spasms and severe back and hip pains at night. On 4/1/21 was followed up again with neurology. Ordered small nerve fiber biopsy for may 18th, increased the gabapentin to 300 mg- 3 times a day and had me wean off cymbalta. I am still dealing with tingling, burning hot and cold sensitivities in both legs, still tingling in hands all day but strength is back to full. I am scheduled to hopefully return to work 5/30/2021 after being off since 1/24/2021.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as no. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccine. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes omeprazole, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (MARLISSA), venlafaxine and gabapentin from unspecified dates, received within 2 weeks of vaccination, for unspecified indication. Patient historically took first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 (Lot number: EN6204) on 13Mar2021 at 11:00 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient previously took hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN) on an unspecified date and indication and had allergy. On 02Apr2021, around 10pm, patient began having chills and extreme muscle pain and spasms, and the lymph nodes in her left armpit swelled up so much that she couldn&#39;t put her arm down without extreme pain.  By midnight (03Apr2021 00:00), patient had a fever and was unable to stand unassisted. She was writhing in pain and arching uncontrollably off the bed.  She believed in hindsight that this was a seizure as she went in and out of consciousness and her tongue swelled up, making it hard to breathe and impossible to speak. She was sweating profusely, and had to drink water constantly.  Her husband had to help her get to the bathroom because she couldn&#39;t support her own body without tipping over.  The chills and fever alternated all night, and she finally passed out from exhaustion at 03Apr2021 at 7am. The next 2 days, she was in a cycle of fever and chills again, and the fever got so bad that she seized twice more on Saturday (03Apr2021).  She had to take the day off work on Monday (05Apr2021) as she was still in so much pain that she could barely leave bed except to use the bathroom. Events were reported as life-threatening, immediate risk of death from the events. Patient was not hospitalized. Treatment for the adverse events were cool baths, naproxen (ALEVE) for fever and pain, and PEDIALYTE. COVID-19 was not tested post vaccination. Vaccination facility type was at a hospital. The outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

This A 30-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EH9899), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 22Dec2020 09:00 for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included reaction to pork, porsine and/or if she ever was exposed to exposed to heparin. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced syncope (medically significant), dizziness (medically significant), feeling faint; like going to pass out now and then (medically significant), overall achiness, severe headaches, fever. The outcome of the events syncope, dizziness, feeling faint; like going to pass out now was recovering and outcome of overall achiness, severe headaches, fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The patient ask: are there any animal products, pork gelatin or a lipid form of that contain in the vaccine?   The events were described as follows: She experienced a significant amount of syncope and dizziness, for greater than 4 or 5 days post-receiving the vaccination. Also feeling faint like she is going to pass out every now and then. Has a more important question, wondering along with the doctors if one of the ingredients may have an animal product, like pork gelatin or a lipid form of that. It looks like one of the ingredients may have an animal cell lipid and was wondering if she was having a reaction to that. Declines to provide primary care provider details. States she received this first dose at occupational health in her workplace. Received the vaccine on the 22Dec2020 at 9am. 24 hours post vaccination, 1 day after, the syncope, dizziness, feeling faint started. Also the other symptoms, overall achiness, severe headaches, and fever were also experienced, but they stopped after that 24 hours. Those were expected since it was listed as side effects that popped up, so she expected those and they stopped after 24 hours. The syncope, dizziness, and faint feeling are not any worse and are very slowly improving, but she still has it and had to call out of work today because of it. That&#39;s consistent. Mentions it takes her a while to get down the stairs when getting product details for the COVID-19 vaccine. Unable to provide the vaccine NDC or expiry, or dose. Did not have any other vaccines at time of this one and none 4 weeks prior. Had to call a (company withheld) doctor and has to go to occupational health tomorrow to be seen. Declines having COVID virus. No further details provided.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events syncope and dizziness are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

It continued to progress and I eventually had decreased ROM, weakness and sharp shooting pain in my shoulder.  Working at OI, I consulted provider, xrays were obtained and I was evaluated.  He strongly suggested an MRI be obtained as well.  That was completed the same day as my evaluation on 12/31/2020 (1 week and 2 days after the vaccine was administered).  The provider informed me that they have had patients with similar situations that were evaluated for frozen shoulder after having a vaccine d/t administration site and vaccine going into subacromial space.  He does report that this was my case/situation, upon my exam, I had severe inflammation with this as well-he is now having me follow up for a surgical consultation for my shoulder to be repaired.  Today&#39;s date is 1/7/2021, I have these same ongoing symptoms that have continued since day of administration, without diminishing in severity.  He is unable to provide an injection d/t my upcoming second dose of the COVID vaccine this next week, 1/12/2021.  He strongly suggests that my 2nd vaccine be administered elsewhere-advised NOT be administered in the same shoulder OR in opposite to cause these symptoms to flare.  He advised in gluteus if possible to avoid any further issues if at all possible.

My hands and feet became clammy. A small fan helped subside symptoms momentarily. Within minutes my lower extremities became shaky. I developed chills and felt faint. VS were measured. I was hypertensive (BP 134/100, baseline BP usually runs 110/80s). I developed intermittent tachycardic and heart palpitations, with a max HR of 124. Symptoms lasted approximately 1hour post vaccine administration.  I work at a COVID testing site, chances of me being exposed to COVID-19 are high. I was not tested prior to receiving either dose of the vaccine; however, I have remained asymptomatic for the duration of the series.

I felt itchy all over.  When I stood up, I felt palpitations and started to feel as if I was going to pass out.  I sat down and I started to tremor and felt like it was hard to catch my breath.  I took an antihistamine and took a puff of albuterol.  I felt a lot better. At 10 AM in the morning, the hives have improved but i still feel some pruritus.

Around 2100 the same night, rapidly progressing paresthesia of complete left face without obvious facial palsy yet (numbness happened over the course of about 30min to the point where I had no perception of touch in the left face).  At this point I took 60mg of prednisone and went to bed. When I woke up, the paresthesia/stiffness was less and progressively so since finishing a course of prednisone.   Concerned that this could have been a bells palsy reaction to the vaccine.

                                                On the evening and day following receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chills, body muscle aches, headache, and fever (99.7-100.2 degrees). I was unable to get out of bed or go to work. I took ibuprofen at first, for my muscle pain but was told I should instead take Tylenol to reduce my fever and address my pain. My fever and chills recurred last night at about 8pm and I took more Tylenol.   Today, I am still experiencing some pain in my arm (injection site) and some chills/dizziness, but am taking Tylenol and have not experienced any recurring fever since last night. I am continuing to drink a lot of fluid and take a low dose of Tylenol at regular intervals.

                                                I did not feel the shot going in, so much so that I wished I had looked to see if I was actually vaccinated. About 6 hrs after vaccine, I felt soreness at the injection site, very similar to the flu vaccine. About 12Hours post vaccine, my arm was so sore I could not lift it. That night I took two Tylenol and had to wrap my arm in a heating pad. I woke up around 3am that following morning with a fever of 104 F. I was so dizzy from the high fever. I felt extremely nauseated. My body ached mostly in my legs and lower back. It hurt to sit on the toilet, to put on clothes. My Fevers happened at night time ranging from 102-104F for 4 days. My injection site soreness lasted for 7 days. Body aches lasted around 2-3 days. Dizziness subsided after my fever broke, but was replaced with a severe headache lasting 2 days.

I got out my blood pressure machine and my BP was 80/60. It is usually 117/70 so this was way out of the ordinary. I felt like I was going to need to call 911 due to the weakness and not being able to stand up without wanting to pass out. Got some salt and water and relaxed until the about 7am  when it subsided.

Roughly 5 minutes after, I raised my hand in the waiting for for the male nurse to come over due to symptoms of dizziness, loss of consciousness, ?blacking out?, and confusion. The male nurse came over and started seeing signs of profuse sweating as water began dripping from all over my body. 5 minutes after that I started heaving and gasping for air unaroused next to the nurse as he took my blood pressure. Blood pressure dropped to 85/76. I started breathing heavy, sweating uncontrollably and couldn?t talk or stand. I remained hardly alert and almost passed out due to weakness.

                                                Incredible arm/shoulder/lymph node pain starting 10 hours post-vaccination lasting about 60 hours. About 12 hours post-vaccine, uncontrollable muscle spasms began and lasted approximately 2 hours. In this time, arm/shoulder/lymph node were extremely swollen. During the muscle spasms, I experienced my first or two &#34;attacks&#34;.  Speaking and thinking became difficult - at times I felt as though I was trapped in my own head unable to speak or move how I wanted (motor function was possible but sluggish and requiring assistance to become ambulatory). The worst of this lasted about 4 hours, though my brain remained some level of &#34;foggy&#34; 48 hours post-vaccination. 1-2 hours into these neurological issues, I lost the ability to feel throughout my whole body. I could tell there was a sensation on my skin, but I could not tell if it was hot/cold/pain/pressure.  I could not feel if I was swallowing, drinking water, or breathing, though I could move enough to perform these activities.  Vision was hazy during these attacks and for a while after. The worst of all these effects lasted 3-4 hours. It then took about 5-6 hours to regain all feeling, though my brain was still foggy/hazy. Heavy swelling lasted several hours, then became moderate swelling, and after 48 hours, there was little to no swelling. About 22 hours post-vaccination, I had another one of these &#34;attacks&#34;, not including the muscle spasms. This second attack was identical to the first in every way, except it was slightly less severe.  Recuperation time was again 5-6 hours. It is currently about 70 hours post-vaccination and most symptoms except moderate arm soreness are gone. During both attacks, BP and temperature were normal, heart rate slightly elevated (80-85 bpm).  Other non-severe effects included fatigue,  slight chills/flush.

By about 10 the next morning, I started getting joint aches in bilateral hip joints and sacral joints. By 10:30 I suddenly found myself lightheaded and had to sit down so as to not faint. Of note, I had just previous to this lightheadedness donned full PPE to work with a patient (gown, gloves, face shield, N95), not having yet worn it that morning. I did not faint, and was able to sit down for 15 minutes without a mask and drink ice water, but I was not safe to work with my patients (as a physical therapist). I left work and went home to sleep. I did not have a fever or chills. After a 3 hour nap, all of my symptoms resolved.  Additional information: I am pregnant, was 16 weeks pregnant at the time. All fetal imaging prior to the first vaccine and after the second vaccine have showed normal healthy development. I am due July 3

The whole body ache was almost gone but her back was still in pain and her blood pressure dropped with random dizziness when she was walking or standing up. The next morning (13Feb2021), the back pain was gone and she felt it back to normal except for a little random dizziness in movement. She did not take any medication to alleviate the adverse effects during the timeline. The patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The patient recovered from back pain in 13Feb2021, the patient recovered from the remaining events in Feb2021.

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient had a syncopal event preceded by nausea and lightheadedness. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive (67/37).  EKG (3/12): Sinus brady, rate 46 bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG (3/12): 89mg/dl. EMS administered 500mL IV saline. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient feels back at baseline and was normotensive (119/72). Patient stated they have a history of vasovagal response and vasovagal vomiting, but had never experienced a vasovagal syncope episode. Physician administered 0.5mg Lorazepam. The ED physician admitted the patient to the telemetry unit for vasovagal syncope due to patient&#39;s prodrome and prior history of similar near syncopal episodes. Inpatient attending agreed that the patient&#39;s vasovagal response may be secondary to poor PO intake with extreme stress. Patient&#39;s admission was less than 1-day and stated they were anxious to return home. Discharged with diagnoses of Mild leukocytosis, Vasovagal response, and Orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration.

Before she could go sit down she passed out. She later woke up on the floor, got up and threw up. Since then her neck and shoulders area has been more tense and tight than normal. She says that other than muscle tension she feels &#34;back to normal&#34; now (three days later).

                                                1022 - Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccine by RN.  She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient. Ambulance in route, about 5 - 10 minutes out per radio communication.  Checking BP every 2  minutes.  Now is 68/44. C/O nausea and vomited. Pulse ox won?t pick up.  Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

                                                I am unsure if this is related but thought I should report it because it was highly unusual, but: My menstrual cycle began at around 12:30am on 03-19-2021. There was some bad cramping as is usual for me in the first 24 hours. I was able to function normally enough until about 9P (on 03-19-2021),  at which time I began experiencing debilitating cramps and muscle spasms that made it difficult to walk or move. I felt lightheaded and like I was going to pass out (which has never happened related to my period before). I got in bed and this persisted until moving at all brought me to tears. I have not been in this much pain from cramps and muscle spasms in over a decade.  And never this prolonged and intense. I was unable to sleep until about 4:30am, managed to sleep for a few hours, had to see, and now I&#39;m here filling this out before I attempt to go back to sleep.  My pain at the moment is high, but similar to what a normal &#34;first day of cycle and it&#39;s bad&#34; day would be for me.  Before this, though, was 8 hours straight of some of the worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt in my life.  I felt it important for me to make a formal report in the event that adverse effects surrounding menstruation were common for others and in case this does not subside. I am thinking it will like the initial muscle aches after receiving the shot.

                                                Two days after receiving first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine started feeling generally unwell. On the third day, started feeling progressively worse: dizziness upon standing and while standing (to the point I thought I would fall over) nausea, dry heaving, headache bordering on migraine, abdominal pain and a short period of appetite loss. Today (fourth day post shot) I called out of work and feel as if I?m on a tilt table while laying down, and will feel dizzy and nauseated immediately upon standing up. This is is spite of staying hydrated and eating a bland diet in order to not upset my stomach.

                                                Patient alerted pharmacist to feeling light headed at 12:10pm. Patient was instructed to sit down on the floor. She stated she felt hot and hadn&#39;t eaten all day. She was given a few bites of apple sauce and some Dr. Pepper to drink in case of low blood sugar. She was also given 25mg of diphenhydramine in case of an allergic reaction after the vaccine adminstration at 12:15pm.

                                                I felt flushed and light headed after receiving the vaccine but as the day went on I felt worse. By 2030 I had severe full body chills and could not stop shaking. I had a severe headache/migraine. Every muscle in my body hurt. This continued on for the entire night. Got tested for COVID the next morning with the rapid results and the symptoms continued with the muscle aches and severe headache. Vision became blurry and I became very dizzy. Slept for 8 hours during the day on 1/7/2021 and then slept another 12 hours that night. The body aches and headaches continued until 1/8/2021 at which the symptoms finally subsided

I took Tylenol 500mg and used Bengay cream on my neck with no relief. I saw my doctor at 0945 that morning. He prescribed Norco, flexeril, and diclofenac. By 1/13/2021 I was able to turn my head ¾ of the way to the left but still have pain. By today, 01/14/2021, I am able to almost completely turn my head but there is still pain, however it is improving and I have increased range of motion.

                                                1/12 0715: Received Pfizer covid-19 vaccine dose 2 at end of shift. Went home to sleep after waiting 15 min.  1630: Woke up. Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

Then, 1-14-21 starting around 8am, I developed GI symptoms, stomach cramping, nausea, and also light-headed and muscle aches. I left work and at home developed a headache and fever of 100.8 F which reduced to 100.2 F with ibuprofen. The fever went away over night so I came to work the next day 1/15/21 and continue to have stomach cramping and slight nausea and was concerned about the fever the day before so that is when I called employee health.

This was swiftly followed by a feeling of tightness in my throat, shortness of breath, and coughing. In addition I had a moderate to severe headache. The hospitals rapid response team was called and I was brought to the emergency department on-site. I was given a racemic epinephrine and albuterol neb treatment which resolved upper airway stridor and cough. I received PO Benadryl, Pepcid, and Prednisone. A EKG was completed. I was observed in the emergency department for about 2 hours until discharge. I was discharged with prescriptions for an Epi-Pen, Prednisone, and Pepcid. The diagnosis on my after visit summary was: Allergic Reaction. I was unable to finish my scheduled shift as an RN.

Around 7:00 that night began to have back pain, fever reached up to 102 around 2:00 am and took Tylenol. Felt very weak, headache, difficulty walking and decreased balance. On Jan 5, 2021 still had back ache and headache. On Jan 6, 2021 I felt better and began to have abdominal pain after eating dinner. I assumed it may be because of eating more then I had in past few days and did not attribute to much but the pain gradually increased to a strange burning/pressure across my upper abdomen that night. Very nauseous and ran low grade fever (99.45). Next morning I had less diffuse pain and could localize it to right lower quadrant.

                                                About an hour after getting the shot, I did get extremely light headed and pulled my car over to get gas. I then noticed a rash all down the arm I got the vaccine and all over my chest and up my neck. I felt extremely hot. I got back in my car and sat at the gas station waiting for the lightheadedness to pass. I did call my GP at that time to make sure everything was OK. The nurse said that it sounds like a reaction but as long as I do not feel like I can not breathe or that my throat was swelling I should be ok. They advised me to eat something and also take benadryl once I got home. Rash stayed for a total of 2 days and today (3rd day) I only have a rash at the injection site. Its very red and hot to touch. Other symptoms I have/still have was very bad headache, fever (highest was 102.8 and today 3 days later is still over 101). Body aches, chills and the first 24 hours I felt like my internal organs were hot (sounds really weird!)

Rash on my arm where I received it went down to my elbow and up to my shoulder and on to my upper back, about 3 hours for it show up. It red, raised and bumpy and it felt hot. This lasted for 4 days. I was very pale and my eyes were sunken in. I literally felt like I was ran over by a vehicle.   I was sleeping for about 15 hours a day. I kept getting chills then I profusely sweats then it switch to freezing cold and back and forth between the two.  I took Tylenol and Benadryl to control symptoms but still felt miserable.  The symptoms all stayed with me to the end. I still do not feel 100%, I am still having ringing of the ears, moderate body aches and headaches. Someone else said they still see the rash but I cannot really tell.  I was also having trouble focusing for a few days after receiving the vaccine, I felt highly medicated not the fun high the bad high.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

At 20 mins my throat felt tighter and it was making me cough trying to get air so they gave me 50 ml of benedryl into my right arm. I started to pass out and my breathing was labored so I was given my epipen and taken to the ER. While I was there I was monitored for 4 hours and given 2 more medications.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: ELO140, expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Jan2021 at 11:45 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included neuropathy and migraine.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) and acacia senegal, ascorbic acid, betacarotene, calcium carbonate, calcium pantothenate, calcium silicate, cellulose microcrystalline, colecalciferol, croscarmellose sodium, cyanocobalamin, dextrin, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, ferrous fumarate, folic acid, gelatin, glucose, hypromellose, lecithin, macrogol, magnesium oxide, magnesium stearate, nicotinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol acetate, riboflavin, silicon dioxide, starch, thiamine mononitrate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide (ONE-A-DAY WOMEN&#39;S) on unspecified dates for unspecified indications. The patient has not had other vaccines in four weeks. On 10Jan2021, three hours after being vaccinated (at approximately 3:00 PM), the patient experienced complete numbness to her left leg (from her ankle to her hip/waist). Hours later, the patient noted numbness to her left arm. Her left knee was buckling, making walking very difficult. The patient reported to the ER, and after several hours of waiting to be seen by a doctor, her right side also became slightly numb, and was also tingling. 18 hours after symptom onset (at approximately 9:30am, the day following injection), the numbness on her right side resolved. It was also reported that the numbness on her left side did not completely resolve for more than 24 hours.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab test which was negative on 13Jan2021 . Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included anti-anxiety medication for calming. The outcome of the events left knee was buckling, making walking very difficult and tingling was recovered on unspecified date, while the rest of the events was recovering at the time of report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported complete numbness to her left leg (from her ankle to her hip/waist)/numbness to her left arm,  left knee was buckling,  walking very difficult, right side also became slightly numb and tingling, and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 2am of 01/29/2021 I became very over heated for about one hour. Around 3am I then became incredibly cold and shaking. Around 4am I got out of bed and stood for a few moments, then walked slowly around my room making my way to our bathroom. I noticed my vision was not right, almost like a fisheye affect and I felt dizzy. I made it to our master bathroom and sat down on a chair for a few moments before I completely passed out. I fell forward, face first on to the bathroom floor hitting the left side of my head. When I regained my conscious I was weak and shaking and was unable to call out to my husband. I slowly pulled myself up to the toilet trying to make some noise and my husband then came to my aide.  As he talked I noticed his voice sounded much farther away than it really was. I also had a difficult time cognitively answering his questions about how I felt. I was pale, clammy, still shaking. This episode from the time I left my bed from the time my husband walked me back to the bed was about 45 minutes. My husband took my temp and I did not have a fever. The next five hours I alternated between feeling very cold and very hot.  I spent the next 24 hours feeling completely depleted. I rested as much as I could and had a greater than normal appetite.

A 31-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL3247, Expiry date 31May2021, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Jan2021 at 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization as frontline worker. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Hospital. The patient reported that she was fine all day Saturday (16Jan2021), she just had some very mild pain at the injection site started a couple hours after getting injection. She developed flu like symptoms on the following day (17Jan2021) at 18:00PM and threw up a couple times. On 18Jan2021 at noon she noticed that she could barely move her arm: anything above her elbow on her right arm was not moving; it was paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up. If someone were to pick it up and let go, she couldn&#39;t control it at all. She also stated that she had no pain at all in that arm; she couldn&#39;t feel anything at all; it was numb. When she woke up on 19Jan2021 the numbness had moved up her neck, instead of being localized to her arm. She stated that when she touched her neck, it hurt a little, but it was not super significant. She stated that it was debilitating at that point as she was maintaining numbness and &#34;no control of her arm&#34;. The nurse reported that this event had not required yet a visit to physician, but she has a feeling it will. She will probably have to go somewhere due to her paralyzed arm, but she had not yet. At the time of the report the event &#34;No control of her arm&#34;/can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; had not resolved yet; the event &#34;mild pain at the injection site&#34; resolved on 17Jan2021, the events &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; and &#34;Threw up a couple times&#34; were recovering and outcome of the events &#34;Numbness has moved up her neck&#34; and &#34;She touches her neck, it hurts a little&#34; was unknown.  The reporter assessed the events &#34;Pain injection site&#34; and &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; as non-serious and assessed the event &#34;Can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; as disabling. She assessed all the reported events as related to BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events numbness of upper extremity and arm paralysis with BNT162b2 use can not be fully excluded.

I was light headed. Removing my scrub top was enough to make me pass out. My boyfriend called 911 and after monitoring me for 45 min, they determined that it was best to go to ER.  Heart rate was in 160s, Respiration was in the 60s, Carbon Dioxide was 11 and pulse ox was around 7%. They did EKG , CT Scan and they gave you oral Benzo. They told me that I probably got the vaccine too soon after COVID diagnosis, which I had in Dec.

The head pains and nausea never lasted more than 5 minutes.  The next day I was extremely fatigued. Slept a lot. The waves of head pains and nausea were more frequent throughout the day after and lasted more like 15 minutes.  The following day the fatigue was gone. Had random waves of dizziness and nausea that lasted about 3 minutes and then would pass.

This lasted about 30 minutes. With my second dose, taken 2/1/2021, also the Pfizer vaccine, I was very ill in the middle night (vaccine taken at 11:15am). I had temperature of 102.5F, severe chills, trembling, and moving took too much effort. I was bedridden for about 8 hours. The symptoms improved quickly there after.

                                                About two hours after receiving the vaccination, I had severe dull pain in my entire  leftarm which received the vaccination.  About 7 hours after the vaccination, I had extreme fatigue and slept for about 2 hours.  I then got up to go to my neighbor&#39;s house (please note, it was about 4 degrees, -6 wind chill, outside at the time).   When I got to the house, I stayed outside and smoked a cigarette for about 5 minutes.  Upon going inside, I got extremely light headed, fatigued,  my hearing went to &#34;white noise&#34; and a high pitched ringing, and my vision got blurry.  I then left the house with assistance to head back home.  While outside, despite the intense cold, I was dripping sweat in a matter of seconds.  I continued sweating and experiencing effects akin to what is felt prior to passing out, for about 7-10 minutes.   I then laid down and went to sleep.  Third day, still some soreness in the arm, but only at the injection site.  No more adverse experiences since.

Concomitant medication included benzalkonium chloride, sodium chloride (ALIVE) and desogestrel, ethinylestradiol (ISIBLOOM) for birth control. After taking the shot she got light headed as she was walking to her car on 20Jan2021 15:00. Didn&#39;t think nothing of it since she was nervous about taking the shot. Then once she got home, she got really tired. She only had one thyroid so the shot made me really sleepy and she had a few skipped heart beats while laying down. After she slept, she felt fine but weird then after being up for a few hours she would get restless again. She got light headed again the next day going to the grocery store then back restless. She didn&#39;t feel normal until this Tuesday, she was not feeling weird and she was not as tired as she had been since she took the shot. She had tried to get seen from her doctor but she was booked up. No treatment was received for the events. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was not pregnant. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No known allergies. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Bee sting on sole of foot morning of getting her second Pfizer dose. She then had a &#34;spider bite&#34; on her abdomen the next day. About 3 days later she developed an itching, lacy, red rash on dorsum of foot and sought care at an urgent care. She was given cephalexin for the spider bite and prednisone 40 for the bee sting. She had never had a reaction to bee stings before and no history of any anaphylaxis. She then came to see me, and I noted the rash with a red rash also over her left second toe with no signs of arterial occlusion or neurologic symptoms.  She had no symptoms or known Covid exposure and the community positivity rate was 1%. We decided to try a high potency topical corticosteroid for the itching on her foot and use the prednisone if symptoms worsened or go to the ER if severe. The next morning, (7 days post vaccination) she reported lightheadedness, increased pruritus of her foot and went to an urgent care where she started systemic prednisone and had a negative Covid nasopharyngeal swab.  She then recovered without complications.

                                                At 10:35 I started feeling weird in my body like when I get either an asthma attack or flu type. It was an hour later when I first began to feel lightheaded, dizzy, chills, and then really cold. I started then coughing hard like my throat was closing up and hard to breathe. My chest got tight and had sharp pains right under my chest by my stomach side. My heart rate was fast to the point my watch alerted me at over 135. I took my rescue ProAir inhaler to help but it didn?t. I tried to settle down and not panic to make things worse on my asthma attack. I then had to lay down feel weak. Within the next 15-20 min I used my nebulizer at home to help me breathe. After one treatment it helped me tremendously but still felt tired, nauseous, fatigue, pounding headache, but no fever since I barely checked at 98.5.

After about five minutes of sitting down, I felt better, stood up, walked a few paces, and felt faint again. I sat down for another five or more minutes and felt better. I continued to feel a bit dizzy throughout the day. Later that day I developed a headache that continued into the next day but was less severe. The following evening, my left arm felt slightly tingly and my pinky on that hand felt a bit numb, as if my arm had a blood pressure cuff on it. That feeling decreased after about two hours.

The vertigo symptoms have persisted, however have subsided.  There was vomiting and intense feelings of dizziness, usually got worse when I moved my head or eyes a certain way.   A week after symptoms began, these feelings are now much less.

At 2:30am I woke up with chills that lasted for 20-30 minutes. I continued to have a fever throughout the night. When I woke up around 8am, I felt extremely sore, my body, head and stomach hurt. My symptoms have been improving throughout the day but I still feel tired. I?ve also had diarrhea throughout the entire day.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 31-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left deltoid on 26Feb2021 15:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to opioids, Toradol, Valium, and a lot of foods; mast cell activation disorder, eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE), asthma, celiac disease, Hashimoto, and hypothyroidism. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL), meloxicam (MOBIC), paracetamol (TYLENOL), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that one min later after the vaccination (26Feb2021 15:16), the patient felt an &#34;aura&#34; (joints loosening, dizziness), gave herself two puffs of albuterol and pulled out her epi pen and called for help. Two mins later (26Feb2021 15:17), the patient experienced convulsions, bronchospasms, throat closure, dizziness, difficulty breathing. Two rounds of epi, non-rebreather O2, rescue efforts. The patient was then transferred to emergency department (ED) to continue rescue efforts. The patient was treated with O2, Ativan, Steroids, Epinephrine, and Benadryl. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid nasal swab PCR test: negative on 26Feb2021 (post vaccination). The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events, cannot be completely excluded. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Recieved the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccination on Dec 26th 2020, and had no major adverse reaction to vaccine except for mild soreness and heat around injection site and intense fatigue for three days after. Symptoms went away after the 4th day. Two weeks later on Jan 5th 2021, i began to notice an intense itching, burning, and swelling at the injection site. Pain and soreness in arm made it difficult to do my job and seem to just get worse. Upon the next morning of Jan 6th 2021, pain remained but itching had gone down, but intense burning, soreness and massive redness around injection site remained and seemed to be getting worse. Pain remains and redness has not gone down, arm is very tender near site and lifting and moving arm is very stiff and sore. Feeling of lump or stiffness on injection site comes and goes and feeling of heavy and sore muscles move from upper left arm down to elbow and extend to hand; making movement and function slowed or slightly numb. Stiffness in arm and intense heat at injection site makes it uncomfortable to move or use arm. Cold tingling sensation on occasion and stiffness in elbow joint. Slight dizziness and fatigue follow with pain in arm. Was informed to see a physician on Jan 6th, 2021 who said to fill out vaccination adverse event report and to keep an eye on arm. If pain or symptoms become worse to return.

                                                As soon as I received my shot it was like an electric shot from the injection shot, up the back of my neck, into my brain. I was instantly woozy and disoriented. They moved me to observation. My hemiplegic migraine started within 10 minutes of the vaccine. I take a preventative every day, and to be honest after the vaccine it was like I had never, ever taken my preventatives. The migraine I got that day is the worst one I have experienced since the first one I ever got.   Now on top of the migraines, the vaccine gave me waves of new symptoms. I was having spells of intense heat flashes, with wooziness, and nausea. So the new symptoms were paired with the hemiplegic migraines that, if you aren?t familiar with, mimic strokes because my whole left side tends to go limp, and I struggle with speech, and cognitive issues. So it really wasn?t all too long before the nurse kindly suggested that I didn?t look great and we should head to the ED.  They treated the migraine, gave me a CT, everything came back fine. They reached out to my neurologist, gave me some fluids, really they wanted to keep me a little longer, but I know the migraine drill and just wanted to go home and sleep and eat. I promised to follow up with my neurologist and fill out my CDC form.  Over the next week the migraine and extra symptoms seemed to slowly but surely let up. The only note worthy thing was really that my left side would get extra tender at times. Not just my injection site, but it was almost like all my nerve endings all over my left side were on fire at times and a pinch on the thigh may as well have been a stab, or a pat on the back a punch. It was pretty intense at times.   And just when I thought it was all over my menses started, you see my hormones trigger my migraines. And once again it was like I wasn?t on a preventative. I had an intense Migraine start. I was able to take my bail out medication (sumatriptan) though and get to work. I moved forward with my day, and just when I thought all was normal, I got one of those brutal heat flashes, the room started moving, and I was nauseous. Unfortunately I was in full PPE, I almost passed out, I had to get a coworker to help, they had to get my supervisor. It was a big, unnecessary-necessary, pride-wounding scene.  Now I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I might speculate that people with neurological deficits, like myself, are going to have a harder time with this inactive Covid strand. I would much rather be immune to Covid then catch it though, so whatever I can do to help, and protect myself and family and friends and neighbors, I will absolutely do... But I imagine there is probably an adjustment to be made here for the neurologically impaired.  Thanks for your time, and let me know if you have any questions.

Notified nurse that gave me vaccine, several other nurses came over and helped me into recliner and laid me back and took vitals. Vitals are stable. I quickly began to feel better (within 5 minutes of being reclined). Still had the numbness and tingling. I laid in recliner for 30 minutes, then sat up for 10 minutes before leaving. I drank water and ate 2 rice krispies while in recliner. Numbness and tingling improved, but lingered throughout the day and was gone next morning.

                                                4 hours after receiving vaccine, I was replacing a door handle, and thought I had moved my arm in such a way that it had subluxed at the GH joint. The acute, immediate pain in the joint and inability to move my shoulder were surprising. It took me a few minutes to realize this was likely a reaction to the shot. The joint pain migrated to my elbow, wrist, hand, and left side of my neck, and those joints were all cracking for about 2 days. My left shoulder is still experiencing discomfort and cracking frequently when I move that arm.

                                                Roughly two weeks in, my equilibrium was off. I started leaning to the right and having to work hard to keep myself upright. This turned into extreme dizziness and nausea. I was unable to drive distances for this reason. Nor walk straight. It subsided slightly right before my second dose.

By 1500 I had severe nausea which resulted in vomiting (water and dry heaving) with a small amount of blood (small clots) with first time vomiting. Then at 1700 I could barely move with severe body aches and headache. Attempted to drink some water and eat soup, but intestines burned too much. Slept from 0800 on 1/28/21 through till 0830 on 1/29/21 with very minimal waking. Only left my bed to throw up one time and use the restroom one time. Took Tylenol around the clock. Upon waking on 1/29/21 noticed a petechiae type rash on both sides of my face, sore throat and mild headache (took tylenol). 1/30/21 no symptoms and facial rash slowly disappearing.

                                                On Sunday, 2/21 both forearms, wrists, and thumbs began swelling and experiencing stiffness, tension, and pain (6/10) that was both burning/nerve pain and achy muscle pain. Previously, my DeQuervein&#39;s had been steadily improving through occupational therapy, home exercise, reduced tech use (scrolling/typing), and splinting.  By Tuesday, 2/23, range of motion on the Left hand, wrist, and thumb was reduced to almost 0 and the pain reached an steady 9/10 on both arms. As of writing this, the stiffness, swelling, nerve pain, and tension remain at a level higher than the initial level that drove me to seek out occupational therapy back in January.  Basically, I went from being close to being discharged to worse than I started. Overall the left side was worse than the right but both sides were impacted.  Occupational therapy (ultrasound, fascial release, and assisted stretching) splinting, stretches, and ice were used as treatments. NSAIDs are contraindicated due to Crohn&#39;s disease.   As of writing this at 16:04 on Thursday, 2/25 none of this has resolved. Pain is a 7/10 on both sides. Range of motion and ability to complete daily care tasks (e.g. dressing, showering, cooking and eating) is nonexistent to minimal.

WHEN 30 MINUTES WAS OVER I ASKED THE PATIENT IF SHE WAS FEELING OKAY. SHE STATED &#34;HER JOINTS FELT STIFF LIKE WHEN SHE TAKES AMOXICILLIN.&#34; QUESTIONED THE PATIENT IF SHE WAS LIGHTHEADED/DIZZY OR HAD TROUBLE BREATHING? PATIENT RESPONDED &#34;NO, JUST ACHY JOINTS AND SWEATING.&#34; AT THAT POINT SHE HAD ANAPHYLACTIC SYMPTOMS. INFORMED PATIENT I COULD GIVE HER SOME TYLENOL FOR THE PAIN. TOLD HER TO GO HOME AND RELAX. INFORMED PATIENT I WOULD CALL HER IN 30 MINUTES TO CHECK IN. 30 MINUTES LATER I CALLED PATIENT AND NO ANSWER AND LEFT VOICE MAIL. 1 HOUR LATER CALLED AGAIN AND NO ANSWER AND LEFT ANOTHER VOICEMAIL. PATIENT CALLED 2-3 HOURS AFTER GOING HOME STATING SHE REPORTED TO &#34;HOSPITAL.&#34; SAID SHE STARTED TO DEVELOP DIZZINESS, SWEATING, MORE JOINT PAIN, NAUSEA, AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH &#34;BUT MAY BE DUE TO NERVOUSNESS.&#34; I ASKED PATIENT ABOUT RECONSIDERING SECOND DOSE OF VACCINE, BUT SHE THEN SAID &#34;THE HOSPITAL STILL RECOMMENDS ME GETTING THE SECOND DOSE.&#34; THEREFORE LEADS ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS NOT A REAL IMMUNE RESPONSE BUT A PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSE.

I was also fine all day on Saturday, February 27th, 2021. Sunday, February 28th, 2021 at 1:30am, I woke up from sleep with double vision, dizziness, and lightheadedness. I went to use my bathroom, and began to feel week. I was still very lightheaded, and weak. I felt as though I was going to faint. My ears started to feel really warm, and I then vomited. I started feeling lightheaded and weak once again, and then suddenly had diarrhea. I was so dizzy, but managed to head to my bed to sleep. Every single day since, I have been dizzy and losing my balance. I wake up, walk around, and sleep dizzy. Then on Friday, March 5th, 2021 I developed a large lump directly under my armpit. I could not take the dizziness any longer and I went to the ER on Monday, March 8th. I was then diagnosed with vertigo and told that I most likely had lymphodenopathy.  Till this day, I am still having dizziness and will be seeing an ENT doctor. I also still have the lump under my armpit. My next dose is, March 19th, 2021.

                                                I had excruciating pain during the injection, which progressively worsened afterward reaching 10/10 L shoulder pain within several hours of the injection. The L shoulder pain was so bad that I could not sleep that night, and the L shoulder pain was unrelieved with OTC Tylenol or Ibuprofen. I also noticed a new swollen lymph node under my left armpit the next morning. The L shoulder pain slightly decreased within 48 hours, but I have continued to have limited ROM of my left shoulder, a steady achey pain of my L shoulder, popping and crunching of my L shoulder with movement of my L shoulder, and difficulty abducting or flexing my L arm past 90 degrees since the injection. 2 weeks post-injection I saw an orthopedist who said my symptoms were caused from the vaccine injection and known as SIRVA (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration). He said I was injected too high, leading to injection of the vaccine material into my subacromial/subdeltoid bursa, causing persistent inflammation of the soft tissue leading to bursitis. He had to perform an US guided Toradol injection to attempt to calm down the inflammation caused from the injection.  I have a 4-week follow up with the orthopedist in April. He indicated that an MRI may be required to further evaluate my shoulder.

                                                On Thursday March 11, 2021 I received my first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. Within about 5 second after administration I began to feel severe arm pain spreading from the injection site down to my fingers that were tingling and numb. Then within about 20 seconds of the vaccine I  fainted.   The fainting spell was brief, a few seconds, but the symptoms that continued after were long lasting.  My blood pressure after was about 80/50, I was diaphoretic, pale, had moderate arm pain (tingling, numb, painful to move) and severe nausea. I was also light headed. These symptoms lasted through the night but I felt overall improved the next day other than fatigue and lingering arm pain. Then on March 16, 2021, 5 days later, I woke up with extreme fatigue. Over the course of the day I then began to get a headache. I got back in bed and then in the afternoon started to feel moderate arm pain again at the injection site and down the entire arm. Then severe nausea set in again along with more diaphoresis, chills and light headedness. The symptoms this time again lasted through the night and I felt better again the next morning.

                                                Patient stated to vaccinator that she sometimes feels faint with vaccines. Vaccinator held her in her seat for about 2 minutes and then she insisted she felt fine and started towards observation area. She got close to the observation area and she started feeling faint and flagged over a National Guardsman who came over and caught losing her balance and slowly lowered her to the ground. She waited in the observation area for 15 minutes and then left on her own.

                                                Patient was wheeled in on a rolling chair(no wheelchair available at time) from nurse that administered vaccine because of anxiety and a needle phobia that put the patient into a kind of shocked state. Patient was sweating profusely, white to the face, and not speaking very much but would answer questions correctly. EMT was speaking with the PT before walking away to continue other monitor duties when he turned back to see patient limp in chair, head back, eyes rolled back, and some twitching movements of the body. EMT called for rapid response  because first thought of seizure and seizure like activity with the twitching movements. EMT got to patient, supported head up straight, and opened jaw to ensure airway was clear. Patient had no response to EMT trying to communicate. Sternum rub was performed where patient came back conscious nearly instantly. PT was unresponsive for roughly 10-15 seconds. Patient was told of what happened and vitals were taken on her, response team was cancelled with most them already on scene. PT was feeling better, sweating stopped, color to the face returned, and PT was speaking and understanding more clearly than before. PT was given a snack and water and was monitored by EMT for an additional 15mins before patient and staff were confident with her leaving.

I am having trouble walking straight and I bump into things or trip over them.  I have fallen because I was not steady.  If I get up too fast everything gets dark and it feels like I&#39;m going to pass out.  I&#39;m also experiencing brain fog: it&#39;s hard to think and I&#39;m really forgetful.  It also seemed to trigger a manic episode, like the first vaccine did.  I can&#39;t sleep my normal amount.  My initial effects, for the first 48 hours, were the typical pain, headache, and intense fatigue.  Those are mostly better, aside from fatigue and mild headache.

                                                The morning after I received the shot in my right arm, I woke up and jumped out of bed to turn off my alarm. My right leg buckled and completely gave out. It felt like there was not a muscle or bone in the leg. I  melted down on top of my leg, twisting my ankle and my knee. I ended up with my knee twisted behind me as I hit the floor and my nightstand. I don&#39;t know if you would call it muscle fatigue or weakness, it felt like muscle paralysis, but it only lasted less than a minute before it was gone, however, the damage was already done. I hurt my knee very badly because I had no control over my leg muscles. I&#39;ve never had anything like that happen before.

Within 2 hours of having the booster she had a sore throat and HA.  Saturday she had the same symptoms.  Sunday = worse HA, fatigue like &#34; i was hit by a truck&#34; nausea and vomiting. Today, 1/11 she woke up with fever 101.3,  took Tylenol and ibuprofen and it went down;  dizzy and vomiting early this morning around 5am. Feeling slightly better now at 1130. However pending COVID results due to multitude of sx?s = may not be reaction to Booster, but rather actually COVID.

She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

                                                Approx 9 hours after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, I began having uncontrollable chills, could not get warm, spiked a fever of 100.4, severe body aches, barely could not move.  It was all I could do to finish my shift at work, drive home, get in the shower, and pass out in bed to sleep.  I slept a good solid 10 hours, woke up for work...fever was then gone and chills, but I had a severe headache, still had severe body aches/fatigue, but I also lost my sense of taste and smell.  I ate a waffle which tasted like cardboard, drank cranberry juice (my mouth puckered like it was tart, but I could not taste it at all).  I reported to work but was immediately sent home by my employee health nurse to be seen by a health care provider and to be tested for COVID-19.  I went home and slept an additional 5 hours, did not do anything at home but rest, and slept a solid 12 hours straight that night.  Still could not smell and taste.  The following day, I could smell things like Vicks vapor rub and I could taste things minimally like when I initially bit into them, or on the back end if that makes sense.  Still had body aches and fatigue, but nothing like that previous day or the night before that.  I was then told that evening my PCR test was negative, and I could report to work the following day.  1/14/2021, I felt almost completely back to normal, and I could smell and taste.

                                                On Sun 12/27 around 12pm I had left arm tenderness and I was fatigued and then at 5pm I had a fever starting at 99.5 and by 11pm 103.5 I had body aches chills, rigers, fever did not break with tylenol or advil . I had the fever until Monday afternoon and it broke for a few hours and came back and did not budge from 101. I called occupational health and asked questions about my fever, monday night at 8pm I had a bad dry cough and SOB and chest tightness and sinus congestion, no sneezing or runny nose, still with a fever. I called occupational health again and they said to come in to get covid tested and results were positive Tuesday 29th AM. On Thursday I started taking medicine: 5 day course of singulair, slow vent albuterol prn teflex antibiotic and calcium, Zinc and  Vitamin D. The fever started to break around Monday the1st to the 4th around 99 to 100 . The 4th  I lost sense of taste and smell and Monday the 28, 2020 I had neuromuscular pain in stiffness in legs and I had trouble walking and when fever got lower I realized I was having pain in my feet and hips. I think the infection triggered the unknown neuromuscular condition. I was supposed to go to work the 11th but since I was still having leg issues and my leave was extended one more week. I do not believe these reactions were due to the vaccine I think it was just a coincidence I contracted COVID prior to getting the vaccine

                                                Woke up about 2 am rigoring, with terrible pain and itching at injection site and awful body aches. I took 650 mg Tylenol, fell back asleep, woke up at 330 am sweating and less achy. Awoke again at 7 am with terrible headache, nausea and upset stomach. Injection site swollen, reddened and painful to touch; took another 650 mg of Tylenol without much relief. Entire body was extremely sensitive to the slightest bit of touch or pressure. Had a hazy feeling in my head, felt mildly dizzy for hours. Around 230 pm on 1/19/21 I began sweating profusely for about 15 minutes and when that ceased  I felt almost back to normal immediately. By the following day I was feeling 100% OK other than injection site discomfort. Today, 1/23, is the first day since receiving my second dose that my arm Only slightly hurts and itches.

                                                Starting several hours after getting the second vaccination I started to experience systemic myalgias, arthrias, and chills.  It got to the point where it was difficult to type.  I left work early that day.  The following morning, 01/14/21, I woke around 06:30 with searing, shooting pains systemically.  There were severe nausea, chills, and fatigue.  I was unable to get out of bed for the better half of the day and took a sick day.  I was able to go into work, 01/15/21, but continued to experience extreme fatigue, cognitive blunting, chills, arthralgias, and myalgias.  Over that weekend I slept 12&#43; hours each day and into MLK day, 01/18/21.  I went into work on 01/19/20 and continued to experience ongoing fatigue (difficult to walk from my office to the bathroom down the hall), chills, the nausea appeared to return, and intermittent chills/arthralgias/myalgias.  I spoke with the physician at the hospital and he directed me to get tested for COVID.  Details below.  This was on 01/19/21.  I continues to experience these symptoms throughout this week: 01/20-01/22/12.  The interval between the chills/arthralgias/myalgias is increasing but the nausea appears to be lingering.  Chills have basically resolved.

I woke at 1am (approx. 10 hours after receiving the second Pfizer vaccine) shaking  and shivering uncontrollably, freezing and at times convulsing. I was experiencing mild nausea and was unsure if I was having a  seizure due to level of shaking and convulsing. Through approx. 4pm the next day I was running a high fever, was almost incapable of speaking or moving due to level of fatigue and weakness. After my fever broke i remained feeling sick through the following day. I needed to take advil for the following 3 or 4 days to manage continual headache, and mild body aches.

                                                It started out as general body aches. Then twelve hours post vaccine I got a fever of 103.4. My fever was consistent for almost 36 hours. After it broke I would be fine and then have hot flashes and then become cold.  I had a horrible pain between my shoulder blades that radiated into my left chest. I had a headache that lasted for 4 days. No matter the pain reliever used nothing touched the pain. My head hurt so bad it made me nauseous and dizzy. I had excruciating left sided jaw pain. It hurt to open my mouth. It shot up through my jaw into my teeth. I was unable to chew anything on that side due to pain, but I ate very little.

I was laid down and administered water until I felt better.  I went back to my worksite while having to use the hand rails because my vision was blurred and I finally made it to my desk.  I was then transported to the ER and my BS was taken which was 85.  I was given IV fluids, a chest xray was performed, a UA and pregnancy test was done, EKG and a CBC done which all was negative and normal.  From my knees down felt shaky the remainder of the week.  I had a visit with my PCP the following week on Tuesday and had a sugar test done which was also normal and by the end of that week all symptoms had resided

When the patient was asked to provide her mailing address, she stated she was feeling really weird, the vaccine was really taking a big toll on her brain function, she was super dizzy and feels just weird, like everything is in slow motion. Lightheadedness started probably about 20 minutes after she had the shot, they made her wait for 15 minutes, now she just feels really weird. The patient was healthy, she just got blood tests back and everything said she is healthy. She thought they said to call if she was having a side effect of dizziness or weakness, as they are more serious, but she called her doctor and they said to call Pfizer. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: unknown results on unspecified date.

I felt like I had taken adrenaline or steroids and couldn?t sleep that might. The next morning I did not want to get out of bed. My body, particular along my spine, was in so much pain that I began crying. On Monday I called in sick to work. I had almost total numbness in my left arm arm, hand, and upper body. Periodically my heart would race and feel as if was about to beat out of my chest. I started to black out in the grocery store and continue feel dizzy and weak. This is my second day off of work and I have only gotten out of bed to perform essential tasks. I am nauseated and am having trouble eating. I feel like I?ve been run over by several cars and can?t feel my left pinkie. I don?t remember ever feeling this bad for any past illness.

                                                Immediately after vaccination (2/27)  I felt a lot of pain in my left arm. The soreness lasted for about 48 hours then went away. I had other symptoms (headache, body aches, dizzyness, nausea, exhaustion). After about 4 days, I had no more symtpoms. I was regularly exercising during this time, so symptoms were not debilitating.  On Sunday 3/7 I woke up to a lot of pain in my armpit and side chest. It hurt a lot. I  still went for a run (7 miles).  On Monday 3/8 I went for a 4 mile walk. After walk, the site of vaccination (upper left arm) was swollen and red, felt sunburned. It appeared very suddenly midday. I noticed there was a large lump under the skin. I felt aches in my hand, left shoulder, and left side of chest. No respitory problems, only muscular.  On tuesday 3/9 the pain did not go away. I went to urgent care and was told it was a delayed allergic reaction. Vitals were said to be okay. Doctor advised usling a sling to relieve weight/pressure. Told to take Benadryl.

                                                Within 15 minutes - hot and flushed, headache. Dizzy.  Fever onset first night. Lowgrade, sub 100.4. General bad feeling. Exhaustion, sore, muscle aches. Felt very hot and flushed even though fever was only 100. These symptoms lasted for 7 days. On day 3, Tuesday, I developed a dull aching pain in both arms. The feeling was like that of a charlie horse in your leg. Dull, painful, like slowly being crushed. Also felt hot pinpoints that itched all over my hands. My hands felt like they were burning, and the itchy pinprick feelings were mostly on my palms and fingers, but would sometimes present up towards my elbows. My hands were somewhat shaky, and still are. Once or twice my hand would flick involuntarily.  The sore hurting arm feeling extends all the way up to my shoulder blades.  On day 7 I went they gave me a steroid shot and a round of antibiotics. They said it was likely a sinus infection.  The symptoms persisted one more day but then the fever resolved Wednesday night, Tylenol took it down and it didn&#39;t come back Thursday. The headache, sore back and neck, and arm pain persisted. It is now day 10. I am most concerned about the arm pain, tingling, and shaking. Please advise on whether I should get my second dose. I might go to a hospital for further testing if this doesn&#39;t resolve or if it progresses.

I was sent back to work and eventually sent home for sever dizziness. I was also sent home Sunday and then severe chills along with dizziness and severe fatigue. I literally laid in bed for days after the shot b/c I felt like I was about to throw up when I moved. I ended up being diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. The side of my face was drooping. My doctor is saying that I ended up with positive Hep C results, which he thinks if false and due to the Bell&#39;s Palsy from the vaccine. I am still having issues. I still have days where the right side of my face will numb and droop. I was told it could take up to 6 months to heal or it could be permanent.

                                                Arm pain is pretty bad.  It began 30-60 minutes after the injection and had steadily gotten worse. Injection site shows no redness or bruising, but the pain has been so bad it has interrupted sleep and is preventing me from being able to lift my arm or carry weight. 800mg Motrin and a heating pad seem to help, but I still have limited range of motion.  This feels similar to the ache from a tetanus shot, just worse.

                                                Received shot ~12:15pm on March 21st. Only symptom throughout the day was sore arm, but tolerable. Around 10:30 PM, I was in bed and noticed that I feel &#34;agitated&#34; and restless. Looked at my FitBit and noticed that my heartrate was unusually high and climbing. My normal resting heartrate is 60-70 bpm. Last night from 10 PM and onward, it rose from 75 pm up to 130  bpm while I was laying down in bed. Soreness in my arm became much worse and more uncomfortable. I focused on breathing slowly and deeply to try to relax myself but did not have any effect. Throughout the night I could feel my heart racing, fluttering and palpitating. Sometimes I could feel &#34;pinching&#34; like sensations too. Every time I was able to fall asleep, I was quickly jolted awake by those fluttering and racing sensations in my chest. I got up ~2 hours later to get a drink of water and had a low-grade panic attack (lost sense of hearing), felt very weak and light-headed, started sweating profusely. Those symptoms let up a bit around 4AM and I was able to sleep lightly. I continued to feel &#34;agitated&#34; and restless all morning until about noon today, a full 24 hours after the shot, 12 hours after symptoms started. My resting heart rate finally started to return to normal at about that time as well. Felt fine and pretty normal by about 1:30ish PM today.

Patients history includes contracting COVID back in June of 2020 for which she spent 2 days in the hospital.  In November of 2020, she reports she ended up in the hospital for another 2 days and was diagnosed with post-COVID POTS.  She then went to medical facility and underwent 6 treatments of hyperbaric oxygen in February of 2021. Patient states that after these treatments, she felt great.  She has reportedly been out of work since November, I believe, and was given the OK to return on 3/10/21.  She was also advised by her neurologist that she should take the COVID vaccine which she did on 3/15/21.  Two days later, on 3/17/21, she states that her POTS was &#34;triggered&#34; and she begain to experience dizziness, fainting, fatigue, headaches, nausea and vomiting and various GI issues. Currently, she states these symptoms are getting worse, instead of better, and she has been unable to work, missing last Thursday and Friday, and will be going home early today.  She asks if she should get her second COVID vaccine.  I advised that is something she needs to discuss with her primary care provider.

                                                I started experiencing innappropriate affect and lost control of emotions. I would cry innappropriately or laugh at things innappropriately. I began experiencing brain fog and memory loss. Then i began experiencing vertigo that impaired my spacial reasoning. On Tuesday 3/9 I lost the ability to see objects far away. on 3/10 I woke up and was unable to read close up, or distinguish letters. The vision and vertigo has continued. I have to shut my eyes completely to walk without becoming sick. I can not be in a busy room with movement or my eyes will hurt. I can not read anything with font smaller then size 18. I can not watch TV because i can no longer see far away. I can not drive a car due to the motion., and i cant see the objects as they move.

                                                It started about 20 minutes after vaccination. I started to feel a rush of heat like a hot flash and my heart was racing while I was driving home. My cheeks and lips were swelled up. My tongue was starting to swell but I could still breathe. I was wheezing so I took a Benadryl and then took another four hours later. I felt very light headed for the rest of the day. The light headedness and dizziness stayed for a few days with a headache. I did not have second dose on the recommendation of my doctor. I ended up contracted Covid-19 three weeks after the vaccine.

I told the nurse I didn&#39;t feel well and wanted to wait a little longer. Within 10 minutes or so, I started to experience tingling sensation all over my face and then it spread to my neck and then to the rest of my body. My face started to feel stiff and I became really hot. My tongue felt swollen and my entire jaw felt very stiff. I lost my ability to speak and then eventually had full body paralysis. I could not move any limb. I could hear and see, but I could not verbalize a response or move any part of my body. I remained in this state for about 1.5 hour. Afterwards, I regained my motor skills and my speech.

                                                I ultimately suffered from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis and was hospitalized for 5 days due to brain and spine inflammation.  I had numbness in my feet 2 days after my vaccine, then suffered from dizziness and nausea 3 days after my vaccine, and had face paralysis 4 days after my vaccine. I went to the ER 4 days after the vaccine and was told I have Bell&#39;s Palsy and Vertigo. I was prescribed oral steroids and anti-nausea medicine. In the following weeks, I had more tingleness/numbness of the legs, brain fog and confusion, blurred vision, unsteady gait, loss of balance, blurred vision and leg muscle weakness, increased anxiety, hearing sensitivity, lethargy, sleeplessness, 6th cranial nerve palsy, tingles in the face, and headaches. I finally got an MRI and when doctor?s saw the MRI results 3 days later, I was told to go to the ER immediately because I had brain and spine inflammation that needed treatment, and was diagnosed with ADEM. I then spent 5 days in the hospital to receive intravenous steroids and monitoring. During this stay, I had more MRIs and a lumbar puncture. I was released on oral steroids for 25 days, as well as follow up appointments and monitoring progress in recovery. Inflammation has decreased. I continue to have tingleness in lower extremities, headaches, pain in legs, and sensitive hearing.

A 33-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Mar2021 12:00 (at the age of 33-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: asthma and lactose Intolerance- not allergy though (as reported). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included: fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR), loratadine, bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and vitamins (as reported), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EN6200), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 20Feb2021 12:00 (at the age of 33-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient stated that 24 hours after her second dose (14Mar2021 12:00), she felt the worst feeling about to faint, all color drained from her face. She got tunnel vision/hearing and felt a &#34;static&#34; feeling all over her body. Then started throwing up. She took a nap and woke up an hour later with 101.2 (degree) fever (14Mar2021) and fought that, along with migraine, aches, chills, hot sweats (14Mar2021). About 8 hours after initial fever (14Mar2021), it spiked to 102.4 (degree) for two hours. It came down quick. The next day, 15Mar2021, it felt like the back of her skull was fractured. And since then (unspecified date), the back (mostly left side) of her head gets so tight and sore especially when laying down. She has been sleeping on heating pad for 10 days now, and it got a little better but still super sore (head). The events involved a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment was received for the back (mostly left side) of her head gets so tight and sore. There was no treatment for the other events. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                After I received my first dose I started to experience my first symptom on March 30, 2021. I noticed that I had a small lump on the left side of my rib cage beside my left breast which was about the size of a sausage link. The area wasn&#39;t painful, slightly tender to the touch and soft. By 4/3/21 the area has expanded to the upper portion of the scapula and it was no longer located on the side of my rib. It was about the size a pear and it was inflamed and very tender to the touch. I couldn&#39;t raise my arm and it was pertruding from my clothing and preventing me from sleeping at night on that side. By 4/5/21 the mass had turned into a different shape and direction and it was no longer just primarily on my scapula.. This current shape favored a boomerang and it started on my lower scapula and wrapped around my arm going directly into the middle of my arm pit.. It was about an 1.5 inches wide, inflamed, painful and wouldn&#39;t allow me to fully lift my arm or lay on it.. The mass was hard and didn&#39;t move, I visited a prompt care and they couldn&#39;t decipher what it was. I began to take tylenol and use cold compress and over a few days the mass began to decrease in size and I was able to increase my range of motion obtaining full extension on 4/17/21. The mass is now smaller than a pencil on 4/22/21 and hardly noticable but it was quite an experience.

Finally patient was on medications and 3 months later beginning to feel a bit better. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care; assessed as life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. The outcome of events was resolved with sequel.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded.

                                                After first shot had a very severe dizzy spell that night. Then continued to have lower-grade vertigo (occasional major dizzy spells) and vision problems for about three weeks afterwards. Was seen by eye doctor and eyes looked normal. Got second dose, and it seemed to improve for a couple days then came back. After a few weeks of continued vertigo and vision problems (mostly depth perception and suddenly became extremely aware of pre-existing eye floaters because of the disorientation) went to an ENT and they were not able to find anything visibly wrong related to vaccine. Went on Ativan and symptoms have improved somewhat on it, but am very scared of them coming back when i go off of it. Seems to be improving very very slowly. This has been almost 2 months of symptoms now. Made it very hard to work or drive.

I started to feel flush and my heart rate rapidly increased. I felt it was nothing so i tried to calm myself and watch my heart rate on my watch and it continued to increase. It started at 100 and within a minute was at 130. I finally honked my horn for assistance and my symptoms continued. I became very faint and nauseous and felt as though i was going to throw up. open my door and took my mask off to help with getting air and it didn&#39;t do much to help. I felt very light headed and uncomfortably closet o passing out than i ever have. This lasted for a good 10 minutes until it slowly passed. Faint, nauseous, hot and rapid heart rate of 130 were my main symptoms and were very uncomfortable.

                                                On Tuesday 12/28 I started to have severe leg pain in my right leg.  The next morning the pain was still in the right leg and had moved up through my right side in my joints to my knee, hip then went to the with shoulder down that arm.  My forearm became very painful on 12/30 and started to swell then radiated into my wrist joint and finger joints.  12/31 the pain continued in all those areas and had moved to my left side of my body starting with the left arm following the same course as the right side.  On 1/1 the pain has persisted and I am unable to perform any ADL&#39;s.  I saw an urgent care physician who told me to take ibuprofen.  I have been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol with no relief. Now all my joints are swelling in bilateral hands, wrist.  On 1/2 my bilateral ankle joints and feet started to have similar pain.  Know all my extremities are difficult to use and it is hard to walk due to the pain.  Because of the pain in my hands things feel heavier than what they should.  I am a medical provider and this almost seems like polyarthralgia rheumatica, I am going to go see a physician on Monday

My injection site (Left deltoid) was swollen and sore, although not more than usual after receiving a vaccine. I had no headache at all. The major concern was the fever and the backaches. I could not get warm, and I was shaking badly because I was so cold. I had ZERO relief despite taking 700 Mg of Tylenol. Side effects finally subsided after about 5 hours.

                                                I had dizziness/lightheaded 10 minutes after dose. Dizziness went away 40 minutes later. 24 hours after dose had body aches. 2 days after dose I had blurred vision in Rt eye and then noticed that Rt eye was fully dilated and Lt eye was normal. Rt eye not responding to light. Went to ED and had 2 CT scans that were normal. They sent me where I had a third CT scan which was normal. I saw ophthalmology and my optic nerve was normal and eyes looked good, but Rt eye still didn&#39;t react to light. they ruled out pharmacological and said that it is something neurological. They still don&#39;t know exactly what is going on. While at the hospital, I started having urinary retention and now have a foley placed. I have follow ups with neurology, urology and ophthalmology and have orders for MRI of brain and neck.

                                                -0715 vaccine administered. -0735 started to feel dizzy/off and right side of tongue felt like it was mildly swelling and itchy. -0735 asked to have blood pressure taken as know when I am having anaphylaxis my blood pressure escalates. -0740 took blood pressure and it was 141/86 in right arm. Normal is 110s/60s-70s. No anxiety feelings.  -0740 throat started to have increased mucous production. Had the tickle and tightness in throat. Asked and received 25mg Benadryl with cup of water. -0742 started clearing throat frequently and slight cough. Knew it was anaphylaxis and told the team I need to go to the ER. Asked for additional 25mg Benadryl. Also took 20mg Famotidine and 2 puffs Albuterol inhaler--this is my prescribed anaphylaxis routine. Had Epipens on standby. -0743 put on O2 saturation monitor and watched O2 drop into 90-92 range. Asked for epipen on standby as I know when I need to start it. Didn&#39;t want to take that when I knew I was about to get it in the ER and knowing self hadn&#39;t progressed that far. Felt chest tightness and shortness of breath. Voice started becoming hoarse. -0800 EMS arrived (delay as team didn&#39;t know if they were supposed to call 911 or a Code--they chose EMS even though in hospital). Then staff at COVID vaccine clinic kept emphasizing need to go in ambulance while EMS and self fought to go through hospital (much quicker route). Finally cleared to go through hospital to ER. To get some air via breathing in had to sit up leaning forward. Voice completely hoarse by this time. -About 0817 arrived to ER bay. At this time, frequently coughing and cough started to sound stridorous. Difficulty getting breaths in. Had chest pain near heart. Greeted by MD, 2 RNS, and technician. -0819 received IM epinephrine. Attached to 5 lead EKG monitoring and O2 monitoring. Blood pressure done again. Higher than previous. -About 0821 had working IV (previous two attempts failed as veins were constricting). Given IV Solumderol. Started bolus of 1L Normal Saline. -Not sure how long after by cough subsided, increased mucous production subsided, as well as hoarseness decreased. -Held for observation for 2hours (would be longer if not resolved). - Discharged around 1015. At this time, hoarseness almost all gone. Minimal throat clearing. Cough resolved.  -Prescribed epipen inhalers (mine expired) and Prednisone. Prednisone is PRN for mild breathing difficulties if it starts again tomorrow 1/13/21.  -At 1400 took 50mg Benadryl and 20mg Famotidine as previously prescribed for anaphylaxis maintenance. Will continue this as previously prescribed every 6hours until symptoms stay resolved. -Made follow up appointment with Primary Care Physician per protocol

Blood pressure was elevated &gt;180/90, HR 110-120.  Gradually decreased and at approximately 30minutes post injection, blood pressure was &lt;145/90 and HR 84.  Took 25mg of benadryl approximately 1 1/2 hour after injection time. Symptoms persisted mildly for another 30-45 minutes after benadryl and seem to be gone 5 hours later. Blood pressure 5 hours after was 134/85 which is still a slight elevation from my norm.

Later that morning 6:30am, I developed severe fatigue, dizziness upon standing and walking,  a L sided headache, L sided arm pain extending from elbow to sternocleidomastoid muscles on the L side, and axillary lymphadenopathy in the same arm as the vaccine (left). I took 650mg of Tylenol and went to work. Walking at a normal pace, my heart rate was 145. At rest inside the hospital it was in the 110s (measured by watch). the headache lasted all day on 1/9 and 1/10 and my neck felt slightly stiff (it was difficult to turn my head to look at traffic behind while driving). I took additional doses of Tylenol on 1/9 and 1/10 and by the AM of 1/11, all of my symptoms had resolved except for the L axillary lymphadenopathy.

Then I was woken up in the night around 3am violently shaking, teeth shattering and unable to even stand straight from shaking so bad. I felt like I was freezing but skin was hot to touch. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take temperature at that time because it was in another family member&#39;s room. I felt nauseated as well. I took 600mg ibuprofen and tried to lay back down. At 3:59am my aunt woke and brought the thermometer downstairs. I could tell the ibuprofen was working some and fever was less as the shaking had calmed. I was able to check my temperature and it was 100.8F (an hour after the ibuprofen). I still took 100mg tylenol at that time.  As of this morning (after 7am) I am sore all over, tired and have a headache, temp 99.2F.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular on 05Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Mild ADHD/ADD. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving vaccination, she was standing in the observation room (where they had all of them stay for at least 15 minutes to ensure no severe reactions) and experienced a sudden onset of vertigo, tunnel vision and pre-syncope. Her hands became cold and numb and she was trying to talk to another staff member who was arranging/scheduling her second vaccination dose at the same time when this event occurred, but it subsided quickly and she started to feel normal again. All these events occurred at 12:45 on 05Jan2021. She reported this event right away and they had her stay in the room longer. She was stable at that point but experienced these symptoms again but very mildly twice more while she walked back to her car to go home. Other side effects on 05Jan2021 that started in the evening and for the following 2-3 days included fatigue, sore arm, leg/thigh aching, sniffles/sore throat, brief dry cough and slight headache/neck ache. Very mild and tolerable symptoms. All events were reported as non-serious by reporter. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and the patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of all events was resolved in Jan2021.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I felt abdominal pain and felt like I was going to get diarrhea and I got really flushed; shaky; face red. They put ice on back of neck. Arm started to hurt. Took Tylenol and sat down. And felt better 15 minutes later. Intervention was ice on back of neck so I wouldn&#39;t faint and rest. Overnight, first night - chills. Woke up with a headache. Took ibuprofen and Tylenol and had body ache and joint pain, too. Five days consistently (positionally) - when I laid down I would get it for five days. I had the vertigo which started 2 days after vaccine. Had a migraine 7 days after vaccine and I had to miss work because it was so severe. Had a typical migraine. Had an aura and it was so bad I couldn&#39;t see to drive to work. I don&#39;t ever get vertigo with my migraines and so this was different. After 7 days all symptoms were resolved. I am currently breastfeeding.

Felt as if I was intoxicated, lasted the whole day. Woke up the next morning and still felt &#34;out of it&#34; and weak but thought it would get better, went to work (im a nurse). Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

                                                First day after, 23rd, arm was pretty sore. 24th it was fine. Going in to the 25th - getting difficult to walk; joints were very rigid. Both hips and both knees and ankles -whole lower body very rigid. Muscles were really tight and tense. It felt like all muscles were engaged stiff and wouldn&#39;t relax. Joints wouldn&#39;t bend (butt on down). I couldn&#39;t walk. During the day on 25th those symptoms still persisted but could walk a little - very challenging - couldn&#39;t ambulate well and it was painful to walk. Day of 26th and symptoms could still persisted and seemed like the morning wasn&#39;t as bad but by evening it was really bad again. I didn&#39;t equate it to the vaccine because on the 24th I felt fine. 28th I tried to work but left early to go to Dr because I had trouble walking that entire shift.  Dr ran tests - Lyme Disease and CBC and SED rate and Rapid Strep test and Antistreptolycin - if any antibody in body for strep; rheutomoid factor ; TSH; C reactive protein; Uric Acid; pathology for Lyme Serology  IG/IGG; ANA with Pathology - all was C reactive proteins was elevated - Put on Prednisone Pack and that made it better until most symptoms resolved and I felt like I could move again. I ran out on a Sunday and by Monday I back to not being able to move again. Got blood drawn Wednesday (Jan 6, 2021). And they rechecked CBC, SED rate; C reactive proteins and rheumotoid factor; CCP antibodies; and they did a comprehensive metabolic panel. And those were all normal except C reactive proteins was elevated but not as much as initial test. A week later added CK test - tested for muscle breakdown and that was normal  Jan 6, 2021 - meloxicam was prescribed and that managed most of my symptoms but I can only use Tylenol with and not Ibuprofen (which doesn&#39;t work as well).    Urgent care initially went to.

Never lost consciousness and was able to able to breath through the event and drink water after a couple of minutes. Patient also felt rapidly hot and dizzy. We had her sit down, take deep breaths, kept her talking, offered water, and got epinephrine ready. She recovered completely after a total of 30 minutes but did feel slightly dizzy throughout the day. Was able to continue with regular workday as we determined it was best she stayed with other people for the remainder of the day.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

                                                Symptoms of nausea began day of, were moderate for several days.  Did not eat much the day of the vaccine due to these symptoms. Numb feeling, tingling in extremities for 2-3 days post vaccination.  Still some occasional numbness and tingling in nose, facial area, and back of head/neck.  Diarrhea for a couple of days.  Continue to experience mild nausea 1.5 weeks later.  Did not have problems with nausea previously.   Moderate fatigue for about a week following vaccination.  Still noticing mild fatigue, getting tired easily and earlier than usual.   Arm was sore from the day after vaccination until about 4-5 days had passed.  Still otice an occasional pain  when moving arm around a certain way.   For 4-5 days following vaccination noticed various body pains.  Pain in lower back- not muscle pain but something else.   Chest wall pain when breathing in from 1-2 days to about a week post vaccination. Headache for a day.  Brain fog feeling, forgetfulness beginning the day after vaccination and was noticeable for about a week.  Still noticing this mildly and feeling more lightheaded than usual.   Over the last few days, I&#39;ve noticed chest tightness and some mild coughing.  It&#39;s also below zero here, so this could be related to weather and dry air, or possibly related to the vaccine.   Generally, I recognize that the above symptoms are possible after this vaccination.  However, the existing literature seems to suggest these symptoms should last 1-3 days and be mild.  My experience has been that they were worse than mild, most lasted at least a week, and some seem to be continuing.   I am also breastfeeding a 19 month old.  He had a brief bout of redness on about half of his body (underarms, forearms, thighs, knees) for about 30 minutes a week after I received the vaccine.  He has never had that before for no apparent reason, and it did not continue, although he has reacted to lotions and certain brands of diaper wipes in this way previously.  We have also noticed that he&#39;s been more irritable lately- throwing tantrums easily, sleeping more often, and getting inconsolable.  We haven&#39;t tied this to any illness, although we do recognize that toddlers can through periods where they have more challenging behaviors.  This is unusual for him though, he&#39;s generally happy and agreeable.  I thought I&#39;d mention it just in case there&#39;s been some sort of pattern that other breastfeeding moms have noticed.

                                                Fever; Headache; Chills; Feeling like a heavy weight on her body; Back pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse, the patient.  A 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ3247), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Jan2021 at 15:20 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included gestational diabetes (first pregnancy) from an unknown date to an unknown date and two pregnancies on unknown dates. Concomitant medications included unspecified post-natal multivitamins and paracetamol (TYLENOL; Lot Number: SBA22; Expiration Date: Jan2023) taken before getting the vaccine on 23Jan2021 to prevent soreness. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 03Jan2021 (at the age of 34-years-old; Lot Number: EL0142) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination (except the first dose). On 24Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced chills and had a feeling like a heavy weight on her body. On 24Jan2021 at 07:00, the patient had a fever and headache. On 24Jan2021, she also had back pain. The clinical course was as follows: On 23Jan2021, the patient took paracetamol before getting the vaccine as she heard one can feel sore after getting it. The patient received the second dose on 23Jan2021 at 15:20. The patient was okay after she got the vaccine. However, early the next morning (24Jan2021), she had shivering without any fever (later referred to as chills). The chills were something she never experienced in her life. It was like she was in the cold. She could not move, it was that bad. She felt a heavy weight on her whole body. She could not get out of bed.  A few hours later at 07:00, she checked her temperature and it was 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She took paracetamol. The headache started with the fever around 07:00. She stated she kept taking paracetamol. She did try to stop using paracetamol, but without it, the headache was still there. The back pain was also severe on 25Jan2021. The chills recovered on 25Jan2021 and the fever was recovered on 26Jan2021. The clinical outcomes of the headache and felt like a heavy weight on the body were unknown; while that of the back pain was not recovered. The events of chills, fever, headache, and back pain were reported as serious by the patient (nurse) for being medically significant. The patient (nurse) assessed the events of chills, fever, headache, back pain, and felt like a heavy weight on her body were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known BNT162B2 vaccine safety profile causality between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The cold heart sensation lasted for roughly 20-30 minutes. Following the start of the cold heart sensation, I became dizzy, sweaty, lost peripheral vision, had numbness in my fourth and fifth fingers (ring and pinky fingers) in both hands, and vaccination site attendant mentioned my hands looked red. Dizziness and other symptoms lasted about 15-20 minutes. Now that over 24 hours have passed, my chest feels a bit tight when I breathe. Injection site is also sore.

Checked temperature and it was 99.8 got back into bed and as I got into bed experienced sudden severe dizziness/spins. I covered my face and told my husband that I was dizzy, began to lay down - and woke to him yelling my name. I fainted in bed. He said I was mumbling and making strange noises but was unresponsive for a few seconds. When I woke, I felt extremely hot and was drenched in sweat. I was also extremely confused and had a very hard time speaking/explaining to my husband where the Tylenol was, where the thermometer was, etc. it was very scary.

                                                Injection received 2/19. On 2/27,  my left arm hurt when lifted above shoulder/head. I noticed this when @ the store reaching for an item on top shelf. Once home, I looked at the arm and noticed it was swollen, red, and hot to the touch. Under the skin was also hard. This was all near (estimated) the initial injection site. I circled the area and took 2 Benadryl. The swelling and hardness increased throughout the evening. Placed an ice pack on it and took 2 Tylenol. My temp was 97.7. Next morning (2/28) the swelling had gone down some, but area was still firm and warm to touch. Took 1 Benadryl and 2 Tylenol. Temp was 97.7 again. 3/1 the swelling and heat had greatly diminished but the area was still firm to touch. It also began to itch at this point. Called my PCP and appt. scheduled for  3/2. PCP indicated it was a delayed reaction to the Covid shot and encouraged me to complete this form. As of today, 3/2, the area is much better. Still some firmness but very minimal.

A 34-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration, on the left arm, on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included sinusitis, placenta accreta, infertility, caesarean section, seasonal allergy, sulfa allergy, and coriander allergy all from an unknown date. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone from an unspecified date. The patient previously took hydrocodone and experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL1284) on 30Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced left arm completely numb and tingling for 4 weeks. No other vaccines were given in four weeks. On an unspecified date after the second shot, it was reported that the patient experienced elevated BP of 166/99, nausea, heart palpitations HR 111, sweating, muscle cramps, swollen lymph nodes, dizzy, body weakness, fatigue, pain moving across the neck/chest/back, trouble sleeping, and pressure in chest. On 30Jan2021, 10 days after the second vaccination, the patient experienced splotchy skin. The events resulted in doctor clinic visit and emergency room care. The patient was given an unspecified treatment for the events. The patient was tested for COVID-19 post vaccination via nasal swab on 26Jan2021 with a negative result. The vaccine was administered in the workplace clinic. The outcome of the events were reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported elevated blood pressure cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

After about 20 minutes my face and lips became numb, my cheeks turned red and hot to the touch, my face started to swell and it felt like my blood pressure dropped, I became dizzy. I took 50mg of Benadryl within 30 minutes of the initial onset of symptoms. All symptoms were gone within an hour of taking the benadryl. Over the next couple hours I experienced discomfort/soreness at the injection site and that tattoo on the same arm as the injection site became raised, hot and itchy. As of 3/3/2021 the only symptom remaining is the soreness at the injection site.

Contacted employee health and their MD stated the following:   &#34;Here is the information I received from, the Director of Infectious Diseases .  She suggested that you follow up with your pcp to start.  The syndrome is called Parsonage-Turner.   Management and prognosis ? There is no specific treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy. Management is conservative. Physical therapy may be helpful to preserve range of motion but will not hasten recovery. Glucocorticoids have been advocated by some [34], but no clinical studies have demonstrated efficacy. In the first weeks, analgesic drugs, including narcotics, may be required to manage patients with severe pain.  Recovery occurs slowly over one to three years, and some patients have persistent disability.&#34;  I have contacted my PCP who has ordered a PT consult (scheduling next week), also seeing an acupuncturist for treatment.

                                                First vaccine I could feel the vaccine go into my body and down into my legs. It was a very strange sensation. I felt very fatigued 30 min after the vaccine but ignored it because it was not normal to have symptoms after the first vaccine. That night i did feel a litlle bit of swelling in my lips that continued into the next day but it was not severe. The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don&#39;t really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn&#39;t feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work. It is now 4 weeks since i had the vaccine and i am still experiencing  some symptoms that seem to be in relation to after i eat. That includes lip swelling, tightness in the muscles around my throat (feel as if they are strained), stomach burning, indigestion, heartburn.  Called PCP again who recommended I see an allergist/immunologist.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on Thursday, morning (11Feb2021), at the time her arm hurt. She had body aches the entire Friday (12Feb2021) and headache; she stayed in bed all day and the next day, she took Tylenol. On Saturday (13Feb2021), she had shortness of breath and the urge to vomit (nausea), she was about to faint. She was also dizzy and checked her blood pressure, it was &#34;high&#34;, around 129/88, but she can&#39;t recall the values exactly. She doesn&#39;t know if she should get the second dose because she&#39;s scared. The patient wanted to know if these are symptoms from the vaccine or could it have been a reaction or allergy. She is scheduled for the second dose on 04Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

I couldn&#39;t even put weight on my left leg. My muscles were so tight and strained in my left leg. It felt similar like bruising around my knee and all the way up to my quads. The following day, I rested and iced my leg all day. I couldn&#39;t go back to my regular routine of working out until Thursday. However, I was limping until Friday morning. March 13th, my leg is still tight and strained. It hasn&#39;t gone back to normal.

I will go from uncontrollably shaking to a fever.  This cycle repeats every 5-6 hrs. This has been on-going for 5 days now.  I am unable to care for my infant as I am too weak to walk without feeling like I will pass out.  Extreme body aches, my bones and joints are painful to move.

Unkown if related. It?s very rare for me to vomit.  Unable to get around well. Right knee pain which caused limping and not being about to walk at times. (Previous history of knee pain, but not for years). As of now I still have these symptoms besides chest pain and vomiting.

                                                Within 10 minutes of injection, patient started to say her eyes were moving by themselves behind her eye sockets and she was feeling alot of &#34;snapping&#34; in her body.  Her blood pressure and pulse were higher than normal and she could not keep her eyes open well. She was observed by nurses for approx 30 minutes and those symptoms seemed to subside although she was not steady walking. Midway into our 30 minute drive home it all started again, this time she said she felt heaviness in her chest but was pointing to her throat.  I immediately drove her directly to the ER. Was monitored for 4 hours and was release to go home, be observed and follow up with Neurologist when possible.  Throughout the night, she continued to say she was shaking alot on the inside and her eyes were still moving involuntarily.   3/20/19 at 8:30 am I called her Neurologist to inform her patients symptoms were continuing.  I waited 8 hours and called back only to have her tell her service I was to call patients Primary Physician.  Which I did.  Dr. was on call and quickly  prescribed medication to help calm patients symptoms.  She prescribed Valium 2mg q 6 hours. 3/21/19:  Patient is still experiencing shakiness, involuntary eye movement and fatigue.  She does not have arm pain at injection site.

She woke up the following morning with a terrible headache and photophobia, later in the day developing myalgias and generalized weakness, followed by possible fever (did not take home temp). She describes the headache as a throbbing holocranial ache that is worse if she bends down She states the headache never really went away fully over the ensuing days, and she did begin to notice blurred vision in her right eye; she eventually presented to  Medical Center on 1/9, where she was tested for COVID-19 and found to be negative - her symptoms were attributed to a vaccine reaction and she was sent home. She continued to have a terrible headache and blurred vision, and so returned to Medical Center on 1/12. She then presented to another Hospital she was admitted for frequent falls in the context of elevated blood pressure. Workup there included a head CT, which was unremarkable. She was discharged with home PT.   On the day of presentation, she fell at physical therapy. Now with pain from R knee down. No numbness in the leg. States leg twisted when she fell. No head strike or LOC. States pain with attempted ambulation. This resulted in her presentation to the ED at a Medical Center on 1/27/21.   On evaluation, she endorsed a headache, holocranial, throbbing, 5-6/10 (has been 10/10). Denies frank positional component. Not worse at any certain time of day. &#43;Blurred vision, worse on the R. &#43;photophobia, not phonophobia. Also complains of pulsatile tinnitus happening almost daily, R-sided, worse when bending down. Denies nausea or vomiting. Denies neck pain or stiffness.   Exam was notable for significant peripheral vision loss in R&gt;L eye and bilateral papilledema. She was seen by ophthalmology with documentation of formal visual field testing (reports included). MRV with filling defects in straight, sagittal, and R transverse sinuses; MRI without FLARE changes, reassuring for no obstruction and/or infarct.

                                                I am an APRN, and received the vaccine not quite one week ago. I waited 15 minutes within the facility and then left. Sat in my car working for about 8-10 minutes when a sudden rush of heat ran through my body.  I felt lightheaded, my tongue was prickly, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I was able to get back into the facility to let them know of the sudden symptoms.  At that time I felt like my heart was racing and was diaphoretic. They continued to watch me for another 15-20 minutes, they did have an epi pen but it was not given. I was feeling slightly better and then left again.  I waited in my car approximately 20 minutes before deciding it would be safe to drive away.  After driving for about 10 minutes I had another rush of heat, lightheadedness, and then I started having shortness of breath.  At this time it would have been about 1 hour, maybe longer, since receiving the vaccine.  I was not close to an emergency medical facility at that time, and did not feel like my throat was swelling so thought it would be best to try to drive to the nearest ER.  I knew I had an epi pen from my work that I could use if needed.  I contacted another nurse practitioner who I work with who stayed on the phone with me until I was able to get to a safe place.  At that time the symptoms had improved, not resolved.  It had been able 20 minutes during this episode.  In all, I continued to feel jittery for about 3-4 more hours.  Since my symptoms did improve I did not go to the ER.  I contacted my health department, Louisville health dept, the following day and reported symptoms to the medical director.

                                                About 40 minutes after my vaccine, I felt sudden onset progressive weakness of my entire left arm with spasms/fasciculations of my forearm and hand  (while driving from hospital where I work as a physician to where I live). I pulled over, felt a bit dazed and was unable to use my left hand purposefully to call 911 on my cell phone, but was able to call 911 on my Watch using my right (dominant) hand. While talking to the dispatcher, my symptoms resolved (total duration a few minutes)  so I requested that they not send an ambulance but instead felt well enough to drive to my hospital ED. I discussed my case with the triage RN and ED attending who felt my symptoms were related to the vaccine, with no further work up needed, given then my symptoms resolved. My vitals were stable in triage.  No chest pain or shortness of breath, with normal neurological function and sensation of my left arm.  Note: I was not officially checked in or seen as a patient.     Sudden onset weakness and spasms of left arm (side of vaccine administration) about 40 minutes after vaccine

                                                I received my second vaccine on Friday 1/8. I felt fine until that evening and then experienced the typical side effects that I had read about. Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP and they said to call employee health.

A 35-year-old female patient (Age at vaccination: 35) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. During her 15 minute waiting period after the injection, the patient began to experience dizziness. Monitored patient for severe reaction symptoms, including but not limited to abdominal pain, blood pressure abnormality, chest pain, collapse, drooling, hypotension, increased swelling, rapid progression of symptoms, respiratory distress with stridor, wheezing, dyspnea and increased work of breathing, skin changes, tongue swelling and vomiting. Treatment included: no therapy. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the collapse, hypotension, respiratory distress and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is very limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including BP measurements, chest x-ray, EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.   This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I went home and was tachycardic 120-130bpm that continued throughout the night to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep my heart was pounding so hard and fast. I was extremely thirsty and dehydrated all night.  I continued to have tachycardia for several days despite hydrating. My thighs also continued to feel week for several weeks. I developed a 100.7 F temperature and had flu like symptoms the following days.

A 35-year-old female patient (weight 55.79 kg, height 160 cm) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EK5730) intramuscularly, in the left deltoid, at single dose, on 23Dec2020 at 12:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were none. On 25Dec2020, the patient felt extremely tired (fatigue). On 28Dec2020, the patient had headache and minor cough noticed. On 29Dec2020, the patient experienced back pain and she said that it felt like sunburn soreness more than anything else. She said that she literally slept 3 days in a row (29Dec2020, 30Dec2020, and 31Dec2020).  On 31Dec2020, the patient lost her sense of smell and developed dizziness. On 01Jan2021, the patient experienced nausea and lost her sense of taste. COVID-19 virus test was found positive on 01Jan2021.The patient recovered from back pain, sunburn and sleepy on 31Dec2020, recovered from tiredness on 01Jan2021, recovered from nausea and dizziness on 06Jan2021. Clinical outcome of the events, smell loss, cough, headache, and loss of taste was recovering. Final clinical outcome of positive COVID-19 test with symptoms was unknown at time of this report. The case was assessed as serious (medically significant). She is scheduled to get 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) on 13Jan2021 and is wanting to know if she is supposed to get it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

                                                I started to feel rundown/fatigued in the evening on the day I got the vaccine and my arm was very sore.  I woke up very early the next morning with a fever of 101-102, body aches, severe headache, nausea, chills, severe fatigue, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, I would get tunnel vision, my eyes ached and felt very strained, sinus congestion and pressure.  My fever spiked at 103.6 that evening and then stayed below 100 after that.  For the following 7 days I still had the severe fatigue, nausea, headaches, chills, dizziness, difficult concentrating, tunnel vision that was especially  bad when I had to drive, eye aches, sinus congestion and pressure, and my head felt very strange.  The best way to describe it is that I felt like someone had drugged me.  The only time I would leave my house was to take my daughter to school and when I would drive my head would feel super tight, my eye ache would intensify and they would feel super strained, I would get the tunnel vision and I would have trouble making it to the school and back home.  Then I would go back to sleep for several hours, get up and drink some fluids and go back to bed.  On day 7 or 8 I was able to stay up for periods of time and either watch movies or just lay in bed.  I went back to work on 1/20 and am doing desk work.  I am doing a lot better but still have daily headaches, moderate fatigue that is worse in the morning, mild intermittent nausea, my head still feels weird like I&#39;ve been taking some kind of pain med or mild sedative, and I&#39;m easily exhausted.  I have trouble going grocery shopping because I get exhausted.  I had a rapid COVID test done on 1/06/20 due to a headache and temp of 99.6-100.2, it was negative and we thought the temp was due to the Trokendi as that is a side effect of it.  I also had a PCR done on 1/12 that came back negative.

                                                A small bump circular in shape is palpable at injections site.  Also a red circle formed around (bigger that the bump), and the area is hardened and painful.   The person could not raise the arm either.  It last approximately 5 to 7 days to improve symptoms.   But still painful for approximately 3 weeks (at the time for the 2nd dose).    The situation repeated with 2nd dose in the other arm (will report separately).

Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

This morning (01/24) I woke up physically feeling warm but I was heat seeking and had a fever of 100.8F and was dizzy. Currently my temperature is 98.6 and aside from a mild headache and a very sore left arm/axillary area I feel better.

However the second dose was given Thursday, January 21. The progressing of the itchy hands and feet lead to my bottom lip swelling excessively large , my tongue begin to swell, my upper lip begin to swell, my lungs begin to burn in my airway begin to tighten. I took two Benadryl and called my family to call 911 and take me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was very low pulse was very high. I had genital pain and swelling, dizziness , nausea vomiting, and extreme body pain. I was given epinephrine, breathing treatments, steroids, Benadryl, and IV fluids. Labs were drawn and my creatinine was high. After about four hours the swelling has gone down and I was able to go home. I have to take steroids for three days, Benadryl for seven , and famotidine.  I have no history of severe allergies, in fact I was tested for food and environmental allergies about a year ago and everything came back negative. I have no history of reacting to any vaccine at any time.

On 1/20/21 went to GYN for exam, explained left underarm pain, told that my breast exam appeared normal, but she questioned if my left ear fullness and left under arm pain were related.  1/21/21 Left Ear &#34;fullness&#34; began to radiated causing left temporal pressure, spreading across forehead.  Pressure developed behind both eyes.  Sudden onset of dizziness occurred.  Went to urgent care where they said I had swollen lymph nodes and believed I was having a auto immune response to something.  Told I received the vaccine on 1/7/21, they said the symptoms could be related to the vaccine.  1/22/21 Notice I would occasionally feel like I had a &#34;lump or pressure&#34; to the side of my throat.   As of present I am continuing to have Left  Ear &#34;fullness&#34;, left underarm aching, and bilateral eye pressure has bee intermittent yet ongoing.

                                                lightheadedness; throat became scratchy; tongue felt thick; hives; itching; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 35-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: E-1284), intramuscular in the right arm on 12Jan2021 at 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism and allergy to IV contrast. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination, had no other vaccine within four weeks, and did not have COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID; reported as other medication within 2 weeks). On 12Jan2021, less than 5 minutes after administration (also reported as at 02:15PM), the patient experienced lightheadedness, throat became scratchy, tongue felt thick, hives, and itching. These were resolved with Benadryl, Pepcid, Zyrtec, and IM steroids (also reported as PO and IM medications). It was reported that the events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient has not tested positive for COVID post vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovered/resolved (also reported as recovering).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

CDC Vsafe called and asked me to report as an adverse event though I wouldn&#39;t consider more serious than most. Had low grade fever (99-100) on tylenol, chills, rigors, myalgias and joint pains starting about 12 hours after vaccination.  Went to work the following day (I am an physician) and by about 10 am had a presyncopal event and was unable to stand/continue working. Was unable to stand without feeling faint for about the next 6 hours.  Was febrile until about 8pm 1/9, never over 100 while taking tylenol. Symptoms completely resolved by 1/10 AM except fatigue for the next 4 days or so, though I developed axillary lymphadenophathy on the side of vaccination starting 1/12 for about 5 days.  No effect whatsoever on the fetus.

There was light headed sensation w/ movement and position, pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode and my eyes were burning.  Because so severe, I took 1000mg tylenol, lathered by entire body in eucalyptus oil and peppermint on my hands, I was able to fall asleep at 3am but it was restless sleep I kept waking up because any movement I made in bed I&#39;d have severe pain.  6am I felt moderately better all symptoms 50% improved, applied eucalyptus oil on again, started work at 730am I could barely function at work I have brain fog, just thinking focusing eyes concentrating makes migraine worse, &#43;photopphobia, phonophobia, just typing is very hard to do because it hurts my joints, the vertigo worsened and the slightest looking down to the keyboard while typing causes lightheaded sensation.  No improvement and it&#39;s now almost 1pm.  I didn&#39;t take any pain medication or apply any essential oils.

I couldn&#39;t lift my injected arm over my head the next day after the injection due to stiffness and pain.  The pain improved over time.  I also had intermittent chills the evening after receiving the vaccine.  I had an episode of diaphoresis the next morning at work.  I checked my temperature when I was having chills and I had no fever.

I should have gone to the hospital but I have an extreme medical phobia so I stayed up and made sure my tounge didn&#39;t swell any further.  The next morning my tounge was normal ish, the red rash was gone and my hands and wrists were back to normal.  5 days later and I am still experiencing headaches, my throat feels sore and a little bit of a hard time swallowing, extreme exhaustion, dizziness, nausea, a feeling of being completely out of it, otherworldly.

                                                Within a minute of the injection, I began to feel a cold sensation that traveled across my shoulder blades beginning at my left shoulder blade.  The healthcare worker came back with my vaccination card within a couple minutes.  I left her know about it.  I had began to feel, but the sensation then spread to the back of my head and down to my lower back.  I felt a little uneasy and had the thought that I probably couldn&#39;t drive.  Before the 15 minute observation period was over, I felt better but still had the cool sensation in the back of my head.

By the evening of 1/21 I could not stop shivering as I was sweating through 3 outfits a day (this lasted 4 days).  By 1/22 my temperature was up to a 103 and I couldn?t stand more than 10 minutes without fainting/passing out.  Fever was gone by 1/25 but still have extreme fatigue/dreams where I?m almost hallucinating to this day 2/7. Did a virtual doctors visit on 1/29 where I was put on 3 days of bed rest, but still struggle to make it through a normal work day.

                                                Severe extremity pain down limb of injection site.  Pain was not muscular, but ache and level of intensity was most similar to my experiences with broken bones.  Pain did not appear similar to neurological symptoms (no numbness or tingling). AE was noted after both vaccine doses, with an marked increase in severity after second dose.  No symptoms immediately after dose or within same day (very minor irritation at injection site).  Next day, severe pain developed down entire left arm.  Pain started slowly, increased over ~2 hours, and lasted for ~24 hours.  Pain was isolated down arm from shoulder to fingertips, with most of the pain felt slightly above and around the elbow, in wrist, and in fingers. During episode, the pain was so severe that the weight of any clothing was unbearable (pain was most similar to my past experiences with broken bones).  Additionally, I was unable to rest my arm or hand on anything (the pressure from resting my arm on a pillow was too severe).  Range of motion was limited, and I could not extend my fingers without pain.

                                                This is a 35 yo female who received her 1st dose Pfizer on 1/22/21.  Within 5-10 minutes of administration, the patient developed shortness of breath, chest tightness, lightheadedness, altered mental status, and EMS reported a brief syncopal episode.  Patient was transported to ED.  On presentation to ED, BP=116/71, HR=96, RR=14, SpO2=95%.  No rash or swelling noted.  The patient did report nausea without vomiting.  All labs and EKG normal.  The patient was treated (by EMS and ED) with Epi-pen x 2 doses, dexamethasone, duoneb, benadryl, famotidine, ondansetron, and IV fluids.  The patient&#39;s symptoms improved and she was discharged to home.  Final diagnosis = anaphylaxis.

                                                I got the shot at 6:30pm. Drove, went to the grocery store, came home, did chores. Around 9:45 started preparing for the next day (getting coffee pot ready, etc.) up until this moment I had no side effects except pain in my arm.  Then at 9:45PM I began feeling light headed, ringing in my ears and fell unconscious. I woke up on my kitchen floor in a small pool of blood and disoriented. I do believe this reaction is related to the vaccine. I DO NOT have a history of fainting. I ate food and drank plenty of water throughout the day and after my vaccine injection. Everything about my day was typical except for the vaccination and losing consciousness.

The heart rate went up to 140-150. Also felt little tingling on both my finger tips. Waited about 30 minutes at site, the heart rate will go down to 120 but then it will go back up again. Felt little lightheaded. Decided to go to ER to check and be monitored. Felt a little prickling feeling at tongue, mouth area.

                                                lightheadedness/dizziness; Vaccine-Related Anxiety; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable healthcare professional.  A 35-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6205) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  During her 30-minute waiting period after the injection, the patient began to experience lightheadedness and dizziness. Treatment included water and snacks. Follow-up response to treatment was excellent. Patient discharged (pending clarification), she was stable to go home and follow-up with PCP. Differential diagnosis reported as vaccine-related anxiety (include misc mental health) and systemic reaction (hypoglycemia, hypotension, generalized rash). Outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported events cannot be completely excluded given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

These symptoms continued along with blurry vision, dizziness, waking at night to ?buzzing? in head, hypoglycemic symptoms. Multiple doctors visits over the past two months, blood tests, BP and heart rate assessments - only to assume it?s  a reaction to the vaccine. Extreme diet change, elimination of the two prescribed meds and detox- feeling much better however still experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms throughout the day and sometimes at night.

                                                On March 2nd I received the first dose of the vaccine.  On March 5th I began to feel poorly and run low grade fever.  On March 6th, I suddenly developed double vision.  The low grade fever and feeling poorly (other than fatigue) subsided around March 7-8; however, the double vision persists.  It is very difficult to focus at times and drive and perform some other activities that require visual focus at medium to far distances.

A 35-year-old female patient received 1st dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, LOT/Batch number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 at age of 35-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 18MAR 2021. She stated ten minutes after the vaccine on 18Mar2021 she became dizzy, hot, almost passed out, couldn&#39;t hear everything sounded really far away. Patient stated this lasted for 20 minutes. Patient stated she also had impaired thinking, couldn&#39;t think straight and no concentration for two days straight. She stated she also had buzzing in her ears and heightened sounds for three days. She stated she had pins and needles sensation in her feet that went up to her legs. She stated on day 9 the pins and needles sensation seems to be in her hands and arms as well. Patient stated yesterday (26Mar2021) her right ear was burning and today (27Mar2021) she has pressure in her ears in addition to the pins and needles sensation. Events were reported as non-serious. Patient would like to know if her symptoms have been reported or are normal. She would like to know how long will her symptoms last and if they are permanent. She would like to know if she should receive the second dose of the vaccine. She would like to know what treatment she should have for her symptoms. She would like to know if there were any reports of autoimmune diseases being diagnosed after receiving the vaccine. She would like for someone to notify her if any information or data becomes available regarding the side effects she has mentioned that were not mentioned in the FactSheet. No information in PI regarding impaired thinking, loss of hearing, heightened hearing, pins and needles in extremities, and burning and pressure in ears. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

Next thing she knew, she woke up on the floor and had a huge bump on her head near her left eye. She passed out and hit her head on the tile in the bathroom. Her left eye was half swollen shut, her eyelid and under eye were black, was very swollen all over her head and eye and was in lots of pain. She went to the emergency room around 04:30. All tests, CT scan and blood work came back normal. She was told that it was most likely caused by the vaccine. Treatment for the events included &#34;CT scan, bloodwork, IV fluids&#34; (as reported). She was hoping that Pfizer will pay for her ER visit since the events were vaccine reactions. She reported that she was still in lots of pain and was not taking pain meds because she was breastfeeding. The events resulted to emergency room and physician office visits. The outcome of pain was not recovered. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021442302 Baby case

                                                Sunday started with severe headache and continued with mild body aches and feeling of just being tired but didn&#39;t change my day much. Woke Monday morning at 4am to get ready for the work and the room was spinning. Off and on for the next 4 or so hours my blood pressure dropped and I had to lay back down. Even laying down had the room spinning. It has not been consistent and has improved as the day has gone but has yet to go away.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 28Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included seasonal allergies, and allergies to sulfa, kiwi, sunflower seeds, and herbal tea. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL), loratadine (CLARITINE), ibuprofen (ADVIL), famotidine (PEPCID), ergocalciferol (VIT D), and ascorbic acid (VIT C). The patient previously took oseltamivir phosphate (TAMIFLU) and nickel and experienced allergies to both. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. On 29Dec2020 at 11:00 AM, the injection site was moderately swollen and moderately painful and the patient&#39;s range of motion was affected (pending clarification). The patient was reporting this because she had never in her life had injection site swelling. The site was not itchy or red. There was no rash. It&#39;s just markedly swollen and painful. No treatment was given for the adverse events. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination and the patient did not test for COVID-19 post-vaccination. The patient had not recovered from the events.

Flushing of hands; Dizziness; Fatigue; Legs became heavy; Joint stiffness of hands; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ 1685), intramuscular on the left arm on 23Dec2020 at 06:30 AM in a hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies of seasonal allergies, cats, and metals; migraines, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and angioedema. The patient was not pregnant and did not have any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination and did not test positive to COVID post vaccination (also reported as not been tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination). Concomitant medication included propranolol, cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), and sertraline (reported as other medications in two weeks). On 23Dec2020 at 06:45 AM, the patient experienced immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands; flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands. She was monitored by colleagues for an hour, prescription for Epi pen refilled, and available angioedema and fatigue persisted for three days. It was reported that the patient was not treated for the adverse events but it was also reported that the AE treatment also included X-ray and antibiotic. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands, flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

                                                I worked the night of 18th and 19th (night shift nurse) -  night of 18th  - arm very sore (dominant arm where shot was taken) by end of night arm was sore; continued for several days. (Got my period either the night of 18th or morning of 19th). About 36 hours after vaccine; stood up to attend an alarm and felt very ill at patient&#39;s bedside and had to sit down: nauseous (felt similar to co-vid) - took Motrin an hour later; the day of 20th - slept all day; 21st - no appetite; mild headache - nauseous - period at same time of vaccine; 22nd - felt bleh; didn&#39;t eat much food - period going away but I  was feeling worse; feel like I have the return of internal vibrations (can sit in my hands when I&#39;m trying to do something for a patient that needs done quickly)  back in July when I had Co-Vid (when I was out of work out of month - and had to see a cardiologist - two months until normal (neural and cardiac symptoms that went away with time) - so was returning of buzzing/etc. 23rd: could feel like I had internal vibrations sensations; nauseous - increased - got a refill from an old dental prescription - started Zofran; headache pressure (head pressure); a vertigo-ish feeling - felt like I just walked off a boat; at that point - called out of work - COVID hotline hospital call - did a rapid test that was negative (on 24th) and on 24th: had still all the same symptoms - nausea was worse and felt a bit more dizzy occasionally and called out of work again but could take care of myself (laid around) - &#34; it felt like baby covid&#34; 25th - work wanted me to get tested again; 26th - Panther Co-vid test - which was also negative. 27th and 28th - dizziness better; still taking Zofran one time /day (for nausea); was able to go to work on 29th - still had some nausea but didn&#39;t have to lie down all day anymore - still had internal vibrations - feels like I should be having a tremor but can&#39;t see it externally; 30th finally able to see primary care Dr and she ordered lab work: Dr wasn&#39;t certain it was an adverse effect vs. me feeling my own immune response to spike protein; Initial covid symptoms in July were similar to this; and she will see how things go; SED Rate was 1 so not concerning; CBC was fine and B12 was fine. Not much as changed since then: returned to work; can go about things in every day; stopped taking Zofran on 31st; I still had nausea but it was mild enough that I didn&#39;t need to take it and Dr said it would be best to stop due to it&#39;s on effects. Yesterday, was first day with no nausea (1/4/2021); still have internal vibrations sensation but it has gone down quite a bit - now more of a mild buzzing electric current sensation - like insides are buzzing super fast ; when I noticed when not occupied with other things which is how it faded out with original illness.

I did not take any medications for this and it subsided around 2000.

Felt like it spread through my body,  I felt a weird feeling in my chest, throat, my legs felt weak, I was light headed and my heart started to beat hard and fast. It then started to subside over several minutes. The nurse kept me for 30 minutes and then I felt ok to walk out. I had a bit of a headache and didn?t feel right the rest of the night.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

Within 10 minutes I had tachycardia (130s), high BP (160s), lightheadedness, nausea, headache, and feeling like I was going to faint. I was attended to by Ambulance paramedics. At the time of her report to her primary care provider on 1/7/2021, she was still having pretty significant side effects (headache, dizziness, and light sensitivity), enough so that I was staying home from work. These symptoms have now resolved.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EJ1685) intramuscular at arm left, on 19Dec2020 06:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing acne. Patient had no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medication included isotretinoin (ACCUTANE). On 19Dec2020 11:30, approximate 5 hours after vaccine, the patient experienced pain, joint pain and tenderness at injection site, progressively loss of strength and eventually inability to move arm. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine (approximately 17 hours post-dose), I got up to use the restroom.  While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

A 36-year-old-female patient (non-pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: ELO140), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 06Jan2021 at 08:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergies to gluten and penicillin (PCN). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took cefaclor (CECLOR) and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the patient&#39;s workplace clinic. The first dose was given at 08:30 on 06Jan2021. A few minutes after, the patient became dizzy and lightheaded for what seemed like a minute or two and then she was fine for the remainder of her 15-minute observation. Around 17:00 that day, the patient became itchy on her right arm and upper right torso area, no rash or swelling was noted. Itching subsided around 20:00 - almost 12 hours post-vaccine. The events were considered non-serious. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from the events on 06Jan2021 (&#34;Itchy on her right arm and upper right torso area&#34; at 20:00).

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

                                                My first dose of COVID vaccine I didn&#39;t have any symptoms (1st dose: 12/23/20). Received 2nd dose at 0800 on 1/12/21. First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

Patient was transported to the hospital emergency department for further evaluation/observation. After 2 hours of observation, patient&#39;s symptoms resolved spontaneously. She discharged from the emergency department to home with family.

Then throughout the night symptoms worsened with significant body chills despite multiple layers, severe body pain and migraine trigger. In the morning felt like full-blown flu with fever of &gt; 100 F, sensitive skin painful to the touch, cold sweats, full body pains, heart palpitations (pounding heart beats and ave 100-120 bpm), and migraine level 8/10. Medication required to try to treat symptoms (metoclopramide, claritin, excedrin). Symptoms continued and did not start to lessen until approximately 30 hours post vaccine dose (18 hours post severe symptom initiation) and two doses of medication regimens. Arm around injection site also showed raised, red irritation local to the site, however, was not exacerbated throughout the symptom course. COVID call center recommended for me to see emergency care facility due to symptoms which I waited to see if symptoms worsened before deciding to not go to the urgent care center.

                                                Immediately felt tightness in chest. Has continued on and off many times a day to this time. Continues now along with periods of difficulty breathing. Today upon waking tightness in chest felt intensified and continues now (evening). Midday experienced sudden vertigo and double vision lasting over a minute along with dizziness. I had already eaten lunch. Primary Dr ordered me to emergency room. Extensive testing along with chest x-ray and EKG performed. No abnormalities were found.  ED doctor said a State test of some sort would tell us if it is an actual allergic reaction or an intensive immune response. He said it would take a few days for results.  I was given diagnosis of vaccine reaction and sent home for rest. Advised to return if symptoms get worse. Tightness in chest continues at this time. Fatigue and headache have also returned.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), intramuscular (left arm) on 08Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included skin cancer removal in September and Covid (reported as prior vaccination); no known allergies. Concomitant medications included spironolactone, ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (LO LOESTRIN FE), desvenlafaxine succinate (PRISTIQ), escitalopram, sambucus nigra (ELDERBERRY), and apple cider vinegar (gummies), and daily vitamin (unspecified). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.  The patient is not pregnant. The patient reported that she had flu symptoms all weekend after she got the vaccine. It included chills, fatigue, headache, dizziness and she had bad muscle cramps in calves. She then started having pain in lymph nodes under left arm a couple days ago. The adverse events start date was reported as 09Jan2021. There was no treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome of events was recovered with sequel (reported as recovered with lasting effects) on an unspecified date. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021, lot# EJ1685), intramuscularly in left arm on 31Dec2020 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID Prevention.  Medical history included ongoing Hypertension/high blood pressure (Diagnosed about 2 years ago).  Concomitant medication included ongoing ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) and just some other vitamins but she does not think that is relevant. She had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine.  The patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy, weakness/felt very weak, hard for her to talk/was having a hard time talking, like she had to put effort into talking, thought that she would pass out, all on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 31Dec2020, tired and sore on 02Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 04Jan2021. The patient got the vaccine on 31Dec2020, and is scheduled to receive the 2nd dose next week and within a couple minutes after getting the vaccine, like less than 5 minutes later, she felt dizzy and very weak, and thought that she would pass out, and she was having a hard time talking, like she had to put effort into talking. After like an hour, she felt better. From then on, she had no side effects besides just being tired and sore, but she had no fever or anything like that. She does have hypertension in her history, but she hasn&#39;t been taking her pill because her BP has been stable. She felt like when she took the Pfizer Vaccine, some people can feel their BP shooting up, like it felt like a sensation in the back of head that her BP went up, but she did not think it was her BP because she has not needed to take her pill because her BP has been good. She did not take her BP, so she doesn&#39;t know what her BP was at the time. It was a pressure in the back of her like how she feels if her blood pressure is elevated. Investigation Assessment: No. Relatedness of drug to all the events was related per source of assessment: primary source reporter, method of assessment: global introspection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the event depressed level of consciousness is possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) , via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 17:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient received the first Pfizer vaccine on 23Dec2020 at approximately 5:15 PM. The patient felt fine until about 11 PM at night, the patient stated, &#34;when I began experiencing intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; on 23Dec2020. I took a Benadryl and went to bed. At approximately 1 AM (24Dec2020) I woke up feeling like I was 500 lbs (I am about 175 lbs). I also had swollen lymph nodes in my neck, a stiff neck, a severely dry throat, and severe shivering. I attempted to navigate to the bathroom and felt like I needed assistance to walk safely to avoid falling. I felt like an impending sense of doom, and called my mom who is a nurse. She told me to contact the Pfizer #, but nobody was answering the phone at that time. I then started looking up on the internet if anyone else had experience what I was feeling after the vaccine and if the feeling passed, as I was not sure if I should go to the ER. I ended up falling asleep.&#34; The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient took Benadryl for events &#34;intense pain in my left arm and dryness in my throat&#34; as treatment. No treatment was given to the patient from the remaining events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Started with some nausea around noon on 1/18 that resolved, then experienced nausea without emesis and palpitations while driving to work at 1800. She describes it as feeling like her heart was racing, but also feeling like she was having large pauses in her heart rate in between the palpitation sensations. She drank a bottle of water and the feeling went away temporarily but it returned.  I am an employee, on arriving to work I noted increased shortness of breath which is unusual for me because I am an avid runner and very active. I noted the palpitations from around 1800-2000, including becoming dizzy and lightheaded during my shift which could endanger patient care, so I presented to the ED and was placed in the CCA. I had received both covid vaccines, second one on 1/11/21 and had about 20H malaise/fatigue and some expiratory wheezing which was abnormal for her but all has since resolved. I had intermittent heart palpitations and chest until 1/26

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid.

They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent. She took liquid children&#39;s Benadryl to try to stop the reaction. It did not help. She clarified it just didn&#39;t work enough to delay it. She doesn&#39;t have UPC, but provided the following information from the bottle: PLD-H242C LB004314 Lot WJ00896 Expiration Feb2023. She then started getting hives on her neck. She was hot, flush, and dizzy. She felt like she was going to throw up. That passed. They then gave her Epi in the opposite arm, her right arm. She got the COVID vaccine in her left arm. Then, they got her ready to go to the hospital. The transfer was smooth. She was waiting for intake when she started to not be able to swallow. She complained quickly. The nurses ran to get Epi, but the paramedic grabbed the patient&#39;s Epi pen and injected it in her thigh. She was IVed up at the vaccine center before transfer. They gave her Benadryl, Pepcid, and methyl prednisone. The Epi pen they gave her was her own shot. They monitored her a few hours. Then sent her home with Pepcid, more Epi pens, and Prednisone for 4 days. She has had normal soreness in her arm at the injection site. It has been status quo, it feels like a tetanus shot.

She screamed.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

Approximately 15-20 minutes after dose was administered I began feeling a reaction. The skin on my face, neck, and chest became red, flushed, warm, splotchy, and itchy. My tongue and throat began to feel swollen/tight. I was also lightheaded and dizzy. My husband was driving the car and we almost returned to the vaccination site, but after approximately 5 more minutes, the tightness in my throat subsided, so we continued to go home. The flushing and lightheaded-ness went away after approximately 20 minutes. This is similar to the reactions I had just before I discontinued taking copaxone (approx. 2 years ago). I did not feel this way after dose one of the Pfizer COVID vaccine.

I was sweating so much my hands were slipping on the steering wheel. I was shaking and felt faint, dizzy. I almost pulled over and and called an ambulance, I never felt this way before, there was this crazy rushing feeling through my whole body. I made it home and sat down, after  some time I slowly started to feel better, about two hours later it completely went away.

Very weak peripheral pulses felt. Pt remained awake but very pale, diaphoretic and slightly cyanotic around the mouth. No rash, wheezing or shortness of breath. Due to low perfusion, pulse ox unable to read. Pt laid down in vehicle (at drive-through vaccine site), legs elevated. Epinephrine 0.3mg 1:1,000 administered IM and pt&#39;s blood pressure and peripheral circulation immediately improved. Transported by ambulance to local hospital emergency department.

These balance issues are slowly improving but remain ever present. I am also experiencing some cognitive issues including word finding problems, difficulty processing verbal information, and general brain fog. I?ve had an increase in fatigue as well. The same weekend the balance issues began I had some visual disturbances as well.

I became light headed, dizzy, and my heart was beating rapidly.  I drove myself to an ER because I thought I was having an allergic reaction.  They kept me for a few hours but I did not receive any treatment.  The other symptoms subsided, however I?m   concerned that my left arm is still tingling.

                                                Within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I experienced extreme dizziness. This dizziness lasted for 2 days. The following day I felt extreme fatigue, body aches and arm soreness at the injection site in addition to the dizziness.  Exactly 7 days later on 3/13/21 (after my initial side effects had resolved), my left arm began to itch painfully and intensely. The itch began on my left wrist and by the end of the day, the itchy spot on my wrist had progressed to itchiness on the majority of my left arm. It&#39;s not very visibly red, but it&#39;s incredibly itchy and painful, like fiberglass under my skin. The itch is not obviously localized to the injection site but is on the same arm as the injection and nowhere else on my body. It has lasted for 24 hours, and I currently still have it today (3/14/21). I have taken antihistamines and NSAIDs and applied cortisone cream, but it is still very, very uncomfortable. It kept waking me up while I slept during the night. I am wondering if this could be &#34;COVID arm.&#34;

                                                This is a positive one, and I can hardly believe it. My irregular pupil dilation independent of each other, occuring for 12 years corrected itself! I swear this is not a joke. I&#39;m flabbergasted.   The longer explanation:  Something I never talk about, partially because I am scared, is an issue with my eyes that started when I was 19. I am now 36.  My right pupil will dilate quite irregularly from my left. A bright light will correct it, but then it will start again after. I&#39;ve mentioned it to eye doctors, and they brushed it off. Research only has scary answers, with no help, so I have learned to live with it.  It used to make me dizzy, nauseous, and I&#39;d lay down. But over the years I&#39;ve adjusted, and it doesn&#39;t bother me.  I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 3/11. Last night, 3/14, I became dizzy and faint.   Today, I still felt that way. I was splashing cold water on my face, when I realized, looking in the mirror, my pupils were exactly the same size! And maintained that same diameter.  I keep checking, but, so far, it&#39;s consistent.   I assume the dizziness, lack of balance, and slight faintness today is my body getting used to this, as it&#39;s been compensating for the difference for 12 years.  So, is this a positive side effect? A coincidence? The vaccine is the only recent change, and nothing else has effected this issue over the years.

                                                A few hours after vaccine began getting itchy all over and slight numbness on left side. Went to ER and was given benadryl. The next morning 3/22 I woke up with hair feeling in my throat and heart palpitations. Went back er BP and treated with hydrolyzed hcl, Famotadine, lorazepam and Prednisone. By the evening 911 was called and I was taken back to er BP for heart rate of 150 &#43;, light headed and nausea. I was treated with clonazepam and discharged that night. On today 3/26 I am still experiencing fast heart rate and taking atarax as needed.

I was having difficulty breathing and my blood pressure was 145 over 95 with a pulse of 120.  The third day I did not feel as ill but still had severe pain in armpit and chest. Today, I feel okay but still having pain in my armpit.

A person on site took my blood pressure which was higher than normal. I was advised to wait longer than 15mins, but after 30mins waiting I still was not okay to leave. I had to call family to come for me, at which point the people on site told me to eat food. I was given water and licorice by the facility, my mother brought me tacos but I still felt very weak. (Weakness was not food related). I was in the waiting area for 1 1/2hrs, advised not to drive myself home, my mother had to drive me home and stayed with me. I also had trouble walking, and was helped to the car. I did not go to a hospital for these adverse reactions as I did not get a fever at any point, and wasn&#39;t exactly sure what could be done for me.  Days following the vaccine I still felt very weak, slept a lot, and felt very out of it. It took 4-5 days to return to normal.

On 2/23/21, I began experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness on exertion.  This continued throughout the next many days.  On 3/1/21 I had sudden onset of dizziness, tachycardia, shortness of breath.  I was admitted to the hospital with bilateral DVT and PE.

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6208) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21Mar2021 14:45 (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included epilepsy and asthma. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included levetiracetam. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EN6203) administered in left arm on 28Feb2021 14:30 (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had the normal yet severe side effects of sore arm &amp; neck, stiffness behind the ear, stiffness of the neck and injection site arm, fatigue, fever, headache, sore throat, chills, for the first few days her 2nd dose. But on day 2, she started suffering from tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, confusion in both ears and increased seizure activity. The events started about 2 days after the second shot on 23Mar2021 12:00 PM; its been a week now and it still hasn&#39;t gotten better or gone away. She had an appointment with her pcp tomorrow but so far nothing has helped. Its debilitating and extremely hard to focus &amp; function. She mainly just wanted to know if any other vaccine trial participant/recipients have reported anything similar &amp; if so, how long can she expect this to last. The adverse events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was unknown if treatment was received for the events. No COVID prior vaccination. No COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Pt was pale and sweating. Her pulse was weak and hard to detect.  I put blood pressure monitor on her.  pt was uncomfortable.  Then I asked pt to lay down.  Short after, I measured pt&#39;s blood pressure was 125/80mmHg, pulse 75.  Pt started to feeling better.  Her 2nd blood pressure was 130/70mmHg and pulse 69.  Pt was ok to stand up later.  I had pt sitting outside of pharmacy and monitored by pharmacy assistant.  Pt left when she felt fine.  About 8pm, pt called to let us know she is fine and thanks us for the care we provided.  I called back to confirm.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 06Apr2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3246) (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included topiramate (TOPAMAX) at 250 mg, daily (2 DF 100mg and 1 DF 50mg at bedtime) taken for migraine, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received fist dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 27Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that since the second vaccination experienced tachycardia, palpitation, shortness of breath and basically blasting of air, difficulty breathing, dizziness and weakness, all on 18Jan2021. She reported pulse keeps raising, elevating to 148-157, she had palpitation complications without doing anything straight away. Elevated pulse and tachycardia, that all started and that was very concerning, pulse went to 209 and that was when she got transported to the emergency room. The patient reported also syncope episodes, costochondritis and chest pain on Jan2021.  On 26Mar2021 the patient experienced having discoloration on her toes, numbness and tingling and that her extremities, from the knee down and both her hands and feet were cold, ice cold. The patient was transported to the hospital by ambulance three times due to the events (hospitalizations on 22Jan2021, 30Jan2021 and 25Mar2021). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Troponin, D dimer, electrocardiogram (EKG), Chest X ray, Full blood count (CBC), exercise electrocardiogram (TMT) all resulted: normal, nuclear stress test: unknown results and pulse 148-157, 209,  all on unspecified date. The patient outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the tachycardia and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.  However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

But about 5 minutes after I received my 2nd dose I got a flush feeling in my chest and then all of a sudden my heart started racing and I felt like I was going to pass out. A nurse came over and felt my pulse. After a couple of minutes my heart rate slowed down. Like I said I do have anxiety attacks but I haven?t had one for a while now. Just wanted to report what happened to me because it was a scary feeling and maybe it was a coincidence. Haven?t had it happen again.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8737), administered in left arm on 01Apr2021 01:15 PM (at the age of 36-year-old) at single dose for so she could be protected from COVID (as reported). It was reported that vaccine was not administered at military facility and vaccination facility type was hospital (reported as patient drove up to vaccine clinic). The patient&#39;s medical history included acute lymphocytic leukemia from 1992 to 1996 and not ongoing (she was immunocompromised when she was young, she was a cancer survivor). No family medical history relevant to events was reported. The patient declined being sick at the time of vaccination. No patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported. No prior vaccinations reported within four weeks. No additional vaccines were administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient previously took gentamycin, amoxicillin and flu shot, culture specific to the flu (as reported), and she experienced allergy with all three on 1996. Patient said that she was immunocompromised when she was young, she was a cancer survivor. She said that right after remission she developed a gentamycin allergy and, because of the gentamycin and amoxicillin allergy she was allergic to the flu shot, not the flu but the egg culture, because the egg culture can be that reaction. Patient also said that she had a reaction to a flu shot back in 1996 or something, it was the same rash that was with the COVID vaccine. It was reported that patient had her first Pfizer Covid vaccine dose on 01Apr2021. She reported side effects of heavy breathing, racing heart, feeling woozy, rash, and pain at the injection site. It was reported that she would like more information and she wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. Patient had both an event to report and a question. She said she had done application, the first vaccine was 2 weeks before the present report and she was not supposed to get the second until this Thursday (19Apr2021), she needed to look at a calendar. She said 01Apr2021 was her first vaccine and that she did already report her events. She said she had a bad reaction that borderline sent her to the emergency room but she instead took a BENADRYL and she laid down and then felt really really really poor the next 5 days. She said she had a terrible reaction, she didn&#39;t feel like her throat was shut, her breathing was heavy, her voice was deep, her heart was racing, like she really had to work to breathe, not like losing her airway passage, just that she had to work to breathe, she had a heavy chest, chest pain, a racing heart. She said she could best correlate it to how feels like low blood sugar, like you are going to pass out. It was also reported that patient experienced woozy, about to pass out. She said she ended up what she&#39;d call a vascular rash. She said it started in the thighs and spread down her legs. She said it was not a rash at the injection site, the rash was under the skin rather than a topical rash. She said she had a photo of it, that it seems like a vascular reaction. She would like to file a report with us because she said she felt like she did not get anything out, she had logged what happened to them and there was no correlation, no confirmation. She said she could send the photo to them. She said she was scared to get second vaccine, she wonders if she should do her due diligence to do second dose, or if she should skip it. She said there was no protocol in place, she had a telemedicine call with her doctor, there was no $200 fee due, her physician said it sounds like patient had more than a normal reaction. She said there were other things that are scary, her doctor told her she should speak to an allergist, but she said it would cost her like $600. She said she didn&#39;t feel good on immediate injection, she felt like she probably shouldn&#39;t be driving her car. She looked for her notes then she said her only normal reaction was a super painful injection site but not a rash. She said the vascular rash subsided with the use of BENADRYL. She said she could not afford an allergist to figure out what&#39;s going on.

                                                2 week migraine; headache; flushed/Got flushed; persistent extreme dizziness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 37-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EK5730, Intramuscular at single dose on 17Dec2020 19:00 on right arm for precaution as front line health care worker. Medical history included Hemiplegic migraine. Her mother also had migraines. Concomitant medication included ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) and H1 and H2 blocker. The patient called to report AE of flushed, persistent extreme dizziness, and a headache that has evolved into a 2 week migraine.  She has a history of hemiplegic migraines and was taking and h1 and h2 blocker when she received the vaccine.  She was calling on guidance whether or not to receive the second vaccine. She was scheduled for second dose on Thursday, but wanted to speak with someone before she got it to see if it was OK. About 15 minutes after receiving the first dose, she got flushed and extremely dizzy. She had a mild headache when she woke up on 18Dec2020 06:00, which then developed into a severe migraine on 22Dec2020 08:00 that she has had for 2 weeks and dizziness continues. She received it at work and there was no prescriber. She called and left a message with Pfizer but has not heard back from anyone yet about this. She would say the flushed and dizziness would be medically serious because she had allergies and had medication on board. She takes daily allergy medication and Zantac and not sure she would not have had a worse reaction if she hadn&#39;t had that on board. She took it every night. She had an H1 and H2 blocker on board. Flushed has improved but the dizziness has stayed constant. She had been treated twice for headache and now they have put her on a Prednisone taper. She got it on her right arm so she could work her arm out. On 22Dec2020, she saw a Neurologist for the Migraine. They gave her Toradol 30 mg and Zofran 4mg injection in office. They were given IM. Then, she had another office visit for urgent care on 02Jan2021, and that was for the exacerbation of the migraine. They prescribed 1 liter of fluids and then another Toradol injection, Zofran injection and Decadron injection. The dose of the Toradol was 30 mg, Decadron was 6 mg, and Zofran was 4mg. These were given IV in urgent care. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The outcome of flushed/Got flushed was resolving. The outcome of other events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events flushing, dizziness, headache and migraine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I also had a moderate to severe headache.  I was unable to work that day.  The pain lessened with ibuprofen but returned later in the day.  By the next day, symptoms were a lot better and after 2 days the symptoms completely resolved

I took tylenol and motrin twice during the 12 hour shift at the scheduled times. I was working night shift when this happen and came home and went to bed 24 hours after receiving the vaccine. The time I went to bed had fatigue, headache, body aches with neck and back pain. Took tylenol and motrin before going to sleep. When I woke up at 4pm, 31 hours after receiving the vaccine I had, sore throat, head congestion, severe body aches and headache. I attempted to get up since I was scheduled to work at 7pm and then got dizzy. I took tylenol and motrin, put a heating pad on my back, drank some hot tea and went back to bed for the night. Woke up at 7:30am almost 2 days after receiving the vaccine still with headache, body aches and fatigue. The sore throat and head congestion seem to have subsided. Took more tylenol and motrin and went back to bed. Still at this time feel just tired and body aches, mostly in the neck and back.

                                                Within 2 minutes post vaccination i started feeling loss of sense of myself. I could not pinpoint if i felt dizzy or vertiginous. Felt like i was off balance and i was super vernous to walk. Vertiginous episodes come and go with peaks for at least 10 times. The whole episode lasted 4 hours until i felt going back to myself.   I was provided water, 1 L and orange juice, there was epi available. No anaphylactic symptoms, no shortness of breath.   I drank 1,5 L of fluids and then my BP was checked 120/80, HR 80s.  I note that i never felt syncopal,  no diaphoresis, nausea, nor darkened vision and i was fully interactive with the bystanders.  Note, i am a critical care intensivist so i had full grasp of the issue but i could now quite describe the sensation of this acute loss of instability. The best way to describe this was vertigo. Similar episode occured at the first vaccine with COVID, occured after 10 minutes and lasted no more than 30 seconds. I didnt report that then because i thought it was just dehydration.

So I did... and then again.... and again.    Then I felt dizzy and disoriented... foggy headed kind of drunk feeling.    Then within what seemed like seconds... my mouth felt full so I opened my mouth and looked in the mirror.   My tongue seemed bigger than usual and lighter in color.  But what was most noticeable was that I had Ripples along the whole outer edge and side of my tongue.    pulse ox reading was an 89 so they administered a prescription strength Benadryl shot and told me they would need to monitor me and keep an eye on me.  Another woman drove me from the vaccination site to the clinic where they checked my oxygen levels again and i was already back up to 99.  They monitored me and checked on me for about 15-20 minutes before releasing me.  My tongue finally felt normal again about 2 hours later while resting at home.

I couldn&#39;t focus on work, and I felt my eyesight starting to get fuzzy.  I realized there was an issue, and decided to go to bed.  As soon as I laid in bed, the chills started, and for the next hour I couldn&#39;t stop shaking.  I couldn&#39;t get comfortable, hot/cold, hot/cold, the chills were incessant and I couldn&#39;t will myself to sleep.  I finally fell asleep and proceeded to toss and turn.  I woke up at 5am on Thursday and could barely move.  My body was so sore and my head was pounding with a migraine.  I was trying to take care of the kids, unsuccessfully, while battling all the symptoms.  The day progressed slowly, and I started to feel better mid day after a few more hours of sleep.  Around 6pm is when the fever kicked in, hovering right about 99.5.  I drank Pedialyte and went to bed not long after I got the kids in bed.  At 2am I woke up with another headache and took more Tylenol.  By 6am today, Friday, the fever broke and I am back to normal.

Moved to observation chair for further assessment and vitals check. Upon getting up to go to the new chair, was lightheaded. Vital signs taken and revealed tachycardia and increased BP beyond normal values. Prior symptoms persist. Healthcare workers continue to monitor me while sitting on chair.  Oral Tylenol for headache was given. Approximately 30-45 minutes in I feel chest palpitations and an uneasy &#39;anxious&#39; type of feeling even though I am just sitting down and staying calm. Due to all these symptoms plus the BP and HR remaining high they gave me  Benadryl 25mg IM to the right arm as well. The BP started to slowly go down after about 2 hrs as well as HR. Allowed to leave hospital vaccination clinic, while BP and HR still high, was better than the first 2 hours.   New symptoms on day 2, pain left arm at injection site and muscles, fatigue and some intermittent nausea. The symptoms continued for 3-4 days post vaccination. I monitored Vitals at home.  BP finally stabilized to my normal range around the 4th day.

                                                After 30 min post vaccination my hands started itching like crazy - skin was red and blotchy appearance but no rashy appearance.  Lasted about 2 hours still after medicating myself with antihistamines.  About 3 days after the vaccine I noticed a different vaginal discharge that has a different odor, almost like a  metallic one.  I am not sexually active at the moment  but this happened after the vaccine. I have never smelled something like this. It does not smell like an STD odor. I got body aches and severe headaches, congestion and runny nose, I felt terrible, I had a low grade fever (99.1F) I am usually on the 97F range) , general malaise and fatigue, I could not get out of the bed, just to go out to the bathroom. Went to the PCP who tested me for flu and covid and both were negative.  The symptoms lasted about 48 to 72 hours.  Except the discharge/vaginal odor all symptoms subsided.

I was felt extremely fatigued and ended up having to go to bed at 6:00pm that day. Then days later, I began to feeling a shortness of breath that lasted about 1.5 week. I literally could not breath normally. My body would force me to yawn to get enough oxygen into my system.

I do have a history of migraines but I have never experienced this vertigo and migraines lasting days on end. I am now currently 19 days past vaccine and still with vertigo and migraines.

Pt approached EMT stating she is &#34;feeling itchy&#34; on her left arm and on her face. Pt said that scratching did not relieve the itchiness she felt. Pt said she received her shot on her right arm however that arm wasn&#39;t itchy. EMT did not obverse any signs of distress or indication including hives or redness on skin however pt appeared slightly diaphoretic as she was fanning herself with papers. Pt stated she has never had allergies to any food, medications or vaccine previously. Pt stated she was not experiencing any SOB and upon observation by EMT her breathing appeared unlabored and within normal limits. Pt also stated she felt a bit dizzy after receiving the vaccine. Pt declined a health assessment from EMT at this time and no further vitals were taken. EMT gave 10mL Diphenhydramine HCl oral solution and a water bottle at approximately 2:25pm. Pt stated at approximately 2:30pm she was no longer feeling itchy. Pt said she felt better when she left the vaccine site with a steady gait at 2:45pm-her husband drove her home.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 01-13-2021 at 8:30am in my left upper arm.  By 3pm that day, my left arm was very tender to the point I couldn?t lift it up and I began having whole body chills and shivering along with extreme fatigue. I went to bed at 5:30pm that night and woke up around 11:30pm to my whole body shaking and shivering and my teeth where chattering together. My husband said I was confused at that time and kept repeating that I was freezing. I must have had 5 blankets piled on top of me to try to get me to warm up.  By the next morning, I soaked through the bedsheets and had extreme fatigue (like I had a hard time keeping my eyes open) all over body aches, fever and chills.  I remained this way for the next week.  At the end of the 1st week I still had chills, extreme fatigue, nausea and horrible headaches and my left arm pain turned into left elbow joint pain. By the end of the 2nd week, I still had extreme fatigue, headaches and left elbow pain along with body tremors. On 1-28-2021, I went to the hospital due to having two episodes where I felt so dizzy I had to lay down on the ground until the dizzy spells subsided. I was given IV fluids and sent home with orders to rest. By the end of the 3rd week I no longer had body tremors or dizzy spells but I still had extreme fatigue needing multiple naps a day along with headaches at which time my primary doctor prescribed me Imitrex to help alleviate the headaches and I still had left elbow joint pain. I also developed bronchitis. It is now February 25, 2021 and I am still having fatigue and mild to moderate headaches along with the left elbow joint pain along with some right elbow joint pain. I have been out of work for over a month now due to my fatigue and joint pain.

Joints remained stiff and painful to use  the rest of the following day.

                                                Immediately after vaccine felt flushed with high heart rate and lightheaded. An hour after, developed chronic mild headache, chronic mild lightheadedness, and chronic moderate fatigue which are expected symptoms with the immune response. HOWEVER, symptoms did not improve in 3 days and actually very slowly worsened until I couldn?t function for work about 2.5 weeks after the vaccine. At this point, the lightheadedness and fatigue were severe and headaches varied between moderate to severe, resulting in me being out of work for 9 consecutive  work days. Had multiple MD visits with tons of tests. During the time I was out, I developed severe lower abdominal pain for two days and severe lightheadedness/nausea/mild vomitting due to being nauseated with chronic headaches. OTC meds did not help much for the headaches nor other symptoms. I have never dealt with symptoms like these before and am very healthy.  At the 4.5 week mark post vaccine, these symptoms finally started to very slowly improve, VERY slowly. Tests at MD were inconclusive. I?m still dealing with chronic mild headaches, lightheadedness, and this past Friday now unusual chest pains that move location and severity.

A 37-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number; EL9262, expiry date was unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, on 26Jan2021, at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient reported that she received first dose of vaccine Tuesday. She did not feel sick or as if she has the flu per her report. She felt body soreness and difficulty moving at a fast pace in Jan2021. She would like to know if it will be okay for her to get the second dose of vaccine. Patient stated that my muscles are too weak in Jan2021. Patient also reported that, I have no fever, I have no cough, I don&#39;t feel sick. It just that my muscles are too weak. It was &#39;like it is after half a mile of swimming&#39; (not clear over the call). I was reading all the papers and it says that it is normal as of one of the symptoms. I was just wondering how long it will take to be that away.&#34; No treatment was given to the events. Outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

                                                Shortly after the shot was administered my left arm started hurting. Nothing too bad. Later that night it became extreme. I took Ibuprofen for it and went to bed early. I had a hard time sleep because it hurt so badly. The next day I couldn&#39;t move my arm without assistance from the other arm. Thursday, 2/25/21, over night I developed a cough and woke up with a sore throat that progressively got worse as the day went on. Fatigue and body aches accompanied this as well. Friday morning, 2/26/21, my arm was 75% better, but my throat, cough, body aches, and overall fatigue were getting worse. I decided on getting a covid test before going to work that morning. I went to urgent care in and took a rapid test as well as a PCR test. Both rest resulted in negatives. Over the weekend my symptoms  were staying the same. The sore throat and cough were progressing. By Monday, 3/1/21, mid morning the Doctor I work for sent me to a walk in clinic  for another rapid and PCR covid test. Rapid came back negative and PCR is still pending. The girl assisting me suggested I report my symptoms. I haven&#39;t been since even with a minor cold since 2009. I woke up Tues. ,3/2/2021, with white pustules on my throat and very hard to swallow along with very heavy brain fog. I have not had any fever this whole time. I take my temperature multiple times a day. I am starting on a 3 day dose of a zpak today, 3/2/21.

                                                It was administered really high in the arm, I started bleeding right away, no other pain at the time really. In the middle of the night I woke up in extreme pain, I couldn&#39;t lift my shoulder or move without being in so much pain.  The first dose was a normal pain but this one I couldn&#39;t move my shoulder. This lasted days with extreme pain. I am still having issues with range of motion in my arm, certain ways I move my arm still causes pain but not extreme.  I did a virtual visit on the next day after the 2nd dose and he prescribed a mild pain medication and recommended if it wasn&#39;t better in a week to come in and see someone. The pain didn&#39;t get better so I went in to see someone.  The did an xray and nothing was wrong. and didn&#39;t know what exactly was going on and said it was  varsities.  He recommended doing cortisone injections but I opted out.

                                                Tongue, lips, face went numb at around the 5 min mark. Then hands and arms. I was dizzy and weak, had a hard time walking. I noticed my vision was blurred. I couldn&#39;t see freckles on my arms that I usually can see. After 40 mins the numbness improved. On the drive home I was swept with head-to-toe numbness for about a min with the feeling like I was going to throw up and chest pain.  The chest pain continued to come and go a few times for the next 10-12 hours. I was very dizzy and very weak. My vision went back to normal about 5 hours later. But I remained dizzy and weak for about a week. I still have dizziness on and off throughout the day that I never had before though.  All those symptoms I feel like are outside of what was expected and concern me but other than that I had symptoms that I expected as well like my arms was sore for maybe 3 hours total the day after, I was tired, and had an elevated temp around 100 degrees.

None of us had a cold/virus. I went to the vaccine clinic, received first pfizer and 6 hours later the dizziness, nausea, severe headaches started. After 5 days I had to go to ER because I was still so sick. They did blood work and gave me fluids. Thursday, 9 days after vaccine, I went to PCP as I was still so sick. I could barely work part-time at work 4 hours a day due to severe dizziness and headaches. Today is Saturday, day 10 and I still have dizziness, nausea and severe headaches.

                                                I first got a bad headache and dizzy. They brought me back behind a curtain with an emergency person. I got very dizzy and nauseous after that. They had me lay down on a cot. About 30 minutes after I received the vaccine, they brought me out to my husband?s vehicle in a wheelchair. By that time, I was so dizzy that I could hardly stand by myself. I was told to call my primary care doctor. My husband called them while we were headed home. My tongue was swollen a little. We decided to go to my father in law?s home, since he is a doctor. By the time we got there, I was coughing. We were still on hold for a nurse at my primary care doctor?s office. I started getting hives on my chest and neck and wheezing around the same time. We left before seeing my father in law to go home and use my nebulizer. For the moment, I used my inhaler, which doesn?t work as well. Once we got to my driveway, a nurse from my PCP office said to go straight to the emergency room. I spent the night at the hospital that night and was treated for an allergic reaction, which resolved the issues. I continued medications at home after leaving the hospital the following day.

                                                Within one hour of the shot administration I became tachycardia, hypertensive, and with chills. Over the next 48 hours my symptoms worsened to include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and near syncope requiring an emergent visit to the ER.  My symptoms persisted and two weeks  later I required another visit to the ER and was admitted to the hospital overnight due to tachycardia, hypertension, diarrhea, chest pressure, headaches, fatigue, weakness, chills, and near syncope.  Since the onset of events post the Pfizer vaccine, I have required multiple visits with MDs/specialist for management of symptoms and course of treatment.  My local physician suspected postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) of which I seeked medical opinion and met with a world expert and after meeting with him, he concluded my symptoms were in fact in line with POTS.  Since then I have continued to experience flare-ups and episodes of tachycardia, most recently 4/14/2021.  It has now been over 3 months since the onset of symptoms post vaccine and I continue to require treatment and management of above symptoms.  I have not returned back to previous level of function nor have I been able to return to work.  I do not have any prior medical history of this condition or set of symptoms.

A 37-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN5318) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 37-year-old, on 04Feb2021 16:30, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines 4 weeks prior. Concomitant medication included ongoing drospirenone, ethinylestradiol (DROSPIRENONE/ETHINYLESTRADIOL) taken for contraception.  The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EL3302) single dose, at the age of 37-year-old, on 14Jan2021 1500PM in the left arm, for covid-19 immunisation and experienced fatigue and a sore arm. On 05Feb2021, the patient experienced fatigue, sore arm, mild chills, and body aches. On 08Mar2021, the patient was hospitalized because of vertebral artery dissection after an intense workout that morning/ she tore a vertebral artery in her neck which she immediately clotted and led to her having a stroke. The patient had vertigo, nausea and weakness on 08Mar2021 and went to the ER and they found she had a thrombolytic stroke in the cerebellum as a result of the vertebral artery dissection. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 08Mar2021 then she was discharged 11Mar2021. While she was in the hospital, they did an MRI and found two sub-acute thrombolytic strokes or blood clots in her brain. The patient tore the artery in her neck which led to the right cerebellar stroke; her blood was really clotty but they could tell by the imaging that the two subacute blood clots that led to having the other two strokes were there approximately three weeks before but not much older than that (without exhibiting symptoms, so she had three thrombotic strokes in total). Since she was discharged she has been out of work and will be on FML for two to three months and going to physical therapy from the effects of the strokes. Adds while she was in the hospital they were trying to determine the cause of the two sub-acute strokes that were unrelated to the dissection. They did several tests including: EKG which was normal; TEE scope down her throat to look at her heart which was normal; and blood work to check for a clotting disorder which was also all normal.  So far nothing has been found. Outcome of mild chills, body aches, and sore arm was recovered on 06Mar2021; outcome of vertebral artery dissection and right cerebellar stroke was recovering; while it was unknown for the other events.

                                                It was extremely painful when I received the vaccine and I immediately felt my fingers tingling. In about 10 min I felt very hot in my face, back and felt like I was going to pass out. My heart was racing, it was about 130. My BP initially was 139 and then 160 after that. I never passed out but I felt those waves with a tingling to my face and my neck as I was going to pass out and I started shaking and my heart was racing and my BP was up and it lasted about 45 min before it started going down.  They gave me some Ibuprofen at the Employee health and they kept observing me and it started getting better after 45 min. I still felt the waves of feeling flush and hot and cold and very fatigued.

Husband got to me and laid on the floor.  Never passed out completely, but it was a very weird and odd feeling.  Felt better  after about 20 mins.  Have felt great since.  So did not go to primary care physician but felt the need to report.

                                                I felt weak and with muscle fatigue the day after the shot. Also had a headache and neck muscle tension and mid back muscle tension. Joint pains as well. These subsided after 48 hours except for the neck and upper back muscle fatigue and mild soreness. This gave me a low grade headaches almost daily since the vaccine. I took ibuprofen a few times which helped. On the 6th I awoke at night and felt weak all over. I felt like I was falling in my bed. Mild dizziness.  I went to work and felt extremely fatigued with muscle weakness but no neuro deficits. I feared some terrible autoimmune illness and took Decadron that day- 4mg tab BID. This helped my muscle weakness but left me with insomnia. The decadron is now wearing off after 4 days and I still have muscle weakness/fatigue. It takes considerable effort walking up the stairs. Yesterday my masseter muscles became fatigued with little chewing. My arms feel heavy when I lift them. The strange thing is that at night when I lie down I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is being triggered. I will get palpitations and feel just strange- I can&#39;t describe it.  I took valium to sleep last night -5 mg tablets that my doctor gave me Saturday as there seems to be an anxiety panic component going on. I have no history of diagnosed anxiety or panic attacks- I have never felt this way before. Today I feel a little better but still have considerable muscle fatigue and neck and upper back muscle soreness and overall muscle tightness in my arms and legs- feels good to stretch kind of feeling. I have mild dizziness when standing up and turning too abruptly. But no considerable focal neuro deficits.

                                                I awoke the next morning after my 2nd dose with the following side effects:  Extremely light headed to the point it was hard for me to walk without feeling like I would pass out, body aches, severe headache, nauseous but never vomited, extremely tired as if I were given a sleep aid, and weak.  I called my primary care physician to see if there was anything I could take to help, they advised me to take Ibuprofen and Tylenol. I started to feel better a few hours after taking Ibuprofen.  The next day I just had a headache and am feeling tired.  I would say the most extreme symptoms lasted about 10 hours and started to slowly feel better after that.

A 38-year-old female patient received the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at 38-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood clotting disorder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: my heart rate, I was like in AFib (medically significant) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, very high fever of 103 (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, dizzy, light headed (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, arms sore (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, exhausted like an extreme fatigue (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered, palpitations (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered.  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated, &#34;the day after the shot I got a very high fever of 103. I was dizzy, lightheaded. My heart rate I was like in AFib, it was going from 60s to 50s all over the place. And this was the next day after the vaccination. That evening nothing my arms was just sore. But the next day all of these side effects just started in and even still today I just feel so exhausted like an extreme fatigue and I am still getting like palpitations.&#34; The patient stated, &#34;So I went to urgent care and they check my vitals and stuff and when they wanted me to send me to the hospital. But I told them I will get a ride and I go by myself just because I didn&#39;t want, capable of an ambulance ride and I ended up just going home because I couldn&#39;t get a hold up anybody. So, I came home and took my blood thinner medication because I do have blood clotting disorder.&#34;  In regard to the outcomes of the events, the patient stated, &#34;I am not experiencing all of them still definitely my heart is much better. I am still getting palpitations but nothing near how it was that first day. I am experiencing extreme fatigue.&#34;

                                                I started feeling lightheaded, heart started beating fast, and I briefly felt like I might pass out. I raised my hand to tell the nurse, and she asked if I wanted to see the EMTs which I replied yes. I was able to walk to the EMTs with no issue, as the lightheadedness had subsided (felt lightheaded for maybe 1-2 min total time). The EMTs took my blood pressure and it was 160/100, with a high heartrate (they didn&#39;t tell me what that was). They gave me some water and I sat for a few minutes, starting to relax and feel better shortly thereafter. They took my blood pressure again, and it was down to 140/84 and they mentioned that the heartrate had gone down significantly as well. At that time I felt fine, and they felt I was ok to go home.

I fell asleep without realizing it at some point and a coworker saw me and woke me up at 0930. I attended a lecture at 1000 and started feeling chills, aches, and was sweating. I tried to take notes but couldn&#39;t remember how to spell a lot of basic words and couldn&#39;t get my brain to focus.  My boss sent me home at 1145. I was driving home and when I got off the interstate I couldn&#39;t remember which way to turn at the light off the exit. I had to pull up a navigation app on my phone to remember how to get home.  When I got home I took my temperature and it was 98.5F. I slept for 3 hours, picked my kids up from school, and then slept for another 2 hours. I took my temperature at 1900 and it was 98.5F still. My chills and aches had lessened but not disappeared by the time I went to bed at 2100, but by the time my alarm went off at 0530 this morning I felt completely back to normal.

Consistent with prior history of dizziness following flu vaccines, patient started to develop mild dizziness and mild brain fog mid afternoon (reported as 09Jan2021 11:30). Flu-like symptoms and headache started around 8:00pm and resolved around 6:00pm on Sunday (the following day; 10Jan2021). Mild nausea also experienced Sunday morning (10Jan2021). Unfortunately, patient was still experiencing dizziness and brain fog that comes and goes and was worse midafternoon.

                                                I got the vaccine at 11am on 1/19/21 by 8pm of 1/19/21 I had a low grade temp and was tired so I went to bed. By 1am I woke up with uncontrollable shivering and had an alarming temperature of 104. I then took alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen and for the next 24 hours and I had a continuous fever for the entirety of 1/20/21 that would range from 101-103 with taking  the constant Tylenol and ibuprofen.  In addition I had shooting nerve pain down my legs, I was so weak I felt like I could not move, terrible body aches, and had what felt like dizziness and blurred vision at the same time. By 1/21/21 I started to improve but still had an increased temp of 99 and body aches but not as bad as the day prior. I am a healthy 38 year old with a good BMI no medical history and am very concerned about the temperature of 103-104 in regards to those with underlying heart or health conditions which may not be able to withstand that high of a temperature or a continuous temperature like I had for an extended period of time . I would have gone to the emergency room but I am a healthcare professional with the education and experience to know what to do in this situation

Patient received Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 10:55 am. Patient requested to sit down as she became faint. After sitting, patient became unresponsive with eyes rolling back in head, and gasping for breath/gurgling. Patient&#39;s head was also bobbing up and down slightly. Patient was then transferred to the floor. After moving to the floor, patient became slightly responsive but was still disoriented. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered into the right thigh at approximately 11:04 am. Patient&#39;s condition continued to improve, although she became nauseous with no emesis. EMS arrived at the scene and patient was monitored in the ambulance per EMS discretion but then left the scene with her husband.

I felt it in my stomach, head, hands, all over.   I told the workers that I didnt feel well.  They moved me to the bathroom and propped me up over the sink sitting in a chair.  I felt very lightheaded at that point and somewhat responsive but was feeling very bad.  I looked at my iwatch and my heart rate was 198.  I felt lightheaded like I was going to pass out.  They had me move to the floor to prop my feet above my head.  They checked my blood pressure and it was normal.  I had them get my purse with my Xanax.  I took 1.5 tablets of .25mg Xanax.  My heart rate slowly went back to normal around 80BPM after about 15 minutes.  The rest of the day I felt very tired.  I felt normal again at 8pm with bo further side effects.

                                                Dizziness; Tachycardia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP. This other HCP reported for self that the 38-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot#: EL0140, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 13:15 on Deltoid, Right at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included she did get a monthly allergy injection about 3-4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she did not have any reaction to the allergy shot, clarifying she has always done well with her allergy shots. Concomitant medications were none.  She said she got dizzy for about 30 minutes afterwards, and then was all better. Caller asked if Pfizer has any guidance on how she should proceed with the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Caller was advised she would be transferred to Pfizer Medical Information for further assistance. Reported she got really dizzy approximately 10 minutes after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, and the dizziness lasted for about 30 minutes after that. She said the dizziness completely resolved. Reported she also got a little tachy (clarified as tachycardia) during the time period she was dizzy. She said she wasn&#39;t sure if she became tachycardic because she was worried when she became dizzy. She said the tachycardia resolved with the dizziness. No treatment was received. The events stared from 05Jan2021 and considered as Medically significant. The outcome of the events was recovered on 05Jan2021. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. No Vaccine Administered at Military Facility. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. No AE was require a visit to: Emergency Room or Physician Office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Relevant tests was none.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of dizziness and tachycardia. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The day following the 2nd vaccination dose, I had zero symptoms other than a slightly sore injection site.  Around hour 30 following the vaccination I began to feel warm, and I got up to brush my teeth and cool off in the bathroom.  As I was brushing my teeth, I started experiencing an increasing ringing noise in both my ears that I thought was strange and somewhat alarming, but I didn&#39;t feel any signs of dizziness or dysphoria.  The next thing I remember is waking up the bathroom floor with my husband standing over me.  Apparently I experienced a complete lose of consciousness and feel to the floor, hitting my chin on the bathroom vanity as I feel and splitting my chin open, which I have zero recollection of.  My husband states that when he found me, that my eyes were open, but I was staring blankly at him with a glazed over look and my whole body was limp and diaphoretic.  I came too in about 30 seconds after he found me, but I was very confused, not making a lot of sense, and felt very disoriented and weak.  It took about 20 mins for my fever to break, and to have the strength and power to get up and walk to bed.  We changed all my clothes because I had soaked through them, and he got me into bed after cleaning/bandaging up my chin.  I then slept solidly until noon the next day, which is very unlike me, but since then I have felt relatively fine with no other experiences of fever/chills/disorientation, just some continued mild fatigue off and on.  After discussing with my nursing colleagues, they all had similar experiences around hour 24-30 post 2nd vaccine with fevers, chills, restless sleep, or just general malaise, but no one experienced a complete loose of consciousness, so I reached out to my PCP yesterday, and she confirmed today that I should report this to VAERS.  I have never experienced any form of loss of consciousness/fainting/black-out/syncope prior to this, which is another reason I thought it was important for me to report this.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID). On 11Jan2021, within about 10 minutes of getting the vaccine she reported that her heart began to race and she became sweaty and uncomfortable. After another 5 minutes or so she began to have difficulty breathing as her chest and throat felt very tight and restricted. She also became lightheaded. Her heart rate was over 100, then dropped into the 70s, then shot back up over 100. Her face had a weird sensation as well. She was given Benadryl first and then epinephrine and had to go to the emergency room via ambulance for observation. She was released after an hour and had to take Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 24 hrs and diagnosed with an allergic reaction. On 12Jan2021,  she had a hot flash upon waking up and felt generally under the weather all day. Her arm was very sore at the injection site. She missed a day of work due to the whole ordeal. On 13Jan2021, she felt more normal but still have some tightness in her chest with a fluttering feeling. The outcome of event diagnosed with an allergic reaction was not recovered; for other events was recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known product safety profile, causality between event allergic reaction to vaccine and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Itching that is still ongoing 1 week post vaccination that started 10 minutes after vaccination. I flushed initially, was dizzy, and then began itching to the head and neck. Itching eventually spread to the torso and legs and became generalized. I began taking benadryl 25-50 mg and continuing pepcid as needed afterwards. GERD also severely worsened and has waxed and waned. Itching overall has waxed and waned, but as soon as medications wear off, itching will very quickly return and is intense to the entire, head, neck, torso and upper extremities. I am also getting breakthrough itching as well even with higher dosages of antihistamines. I had to call out from work 2/5/21 today as a medical provider in primary due to the effects of the antihistamines.   I called my allergy/immunology specialist on Tuesday 2/2/21 and he prescribed xyzal 5mg twice daily and hydroxyzine 25 mg at night. I saw him in the office yesterday, and after discussion, overall decided I should not receive the second dose of the vaccine, and when itching subsides and able to be off of antihistamines for 3 days we will do the PEG protocol testing, and in another 1-2 weeks (14-21 days after initial injection) we will do an IgG spike test to see if I developed antibodies.

The whole day I had to be careful I would get vertigo so bad it I moved to quick. I went to my Chiropractor, he thought it was the benign and had me do a specific maneuver. It made me nausea for an hour then went away.  As long as I didn&#39;t bend over funny I though I was ok. On the 9th and 10th I felt general dizzy, I would turn and just kind of felt like I was spinning.  I took Sudafed because my ears felt full. Then the vertigo was just gone.

                                                My wife was six weeks pregnant when she took the second shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine, estimated date of birth is oct 4 2021. Within 10 minutes of the vaccine she became ill dizziness nausea throwing up vertigo and it persisted for about a week heavily. The nurses were unequipped to handle possible side effects from the vaccine putting her in a corner and having her vomit in a box. They ignored her when suffering from obvious effect from the vaccine.  One nurse on our way out even told her to put on her mask as I dragged her out of terrible situation.She was unable to work drive or function somewhat normally for 4-5 days then it began to diminish. She is still having instances of vertigo and dizziness however much less.

Pharmacist was called over and patient had her head between her knees while sitting in the waiting area.  She said she felt very dizzy but sitting forward wasn&#39;t helping.  Then about 30 seconds later patient stated she was going to pass out and wanted to lay on the floor.  While getting up she fell down and passed out, hitting her head on the cement floor.  911 called.  Patient came to about a minute later and stated she was going to throw up.

They examined her and took her to the er to verify if she had a concussion and make sure she was okay.

                                                Immediately felt dizzy/woozy. Within 1 minute felt extremely hot and a bright red, splotchy rash appeared all over my chest, neck, face, back. Jaw and tongue felt tingly, but not unsure if that meant swollen. Medic checked heart rate and BP which were elevated. HR was in 120&#39;s and BP was 140&#39;s/80&#39;s for a prolonged period of time. Doctor gave Benadryl which seemed to help. Doctor and Medic watched me for an hour. Rash mostly went away within 5 hours, however once I came home, I noticed it had also been on my legs.  The rash never produced hives, but the Doctor onsite confirmed this was an immediate allergic reaction, and said to see my regular doctor and an allergist. Since the shot some flushed look has come back in spots each day for a short period of time (maybe 10 mins or so). Still taking Claritin.

                                                A couple of minutes after the vaccine I started feeling very dizzy,  nauseas. My husband had to drive me from the vaccine site back to work. When I got to my job they sent me to the ER because of how I was feeling. My heart rate was very fast, my blood pressure was very high they did blood work &amp; my potassium came low. I got sent home &amp; this symptoms lasted for about 3 days.

Lightheadedness/fatigue the evening of 2/26 and part of the day after. Some tenderness/soreness in underarm area of the same arm injected.  This didn&#39;t start for probably a week or so and lasted for maybe a week.  I am not 100% sure on the timelines for that, but I know it didn&#39;t start right away and I know it was gone by 2.5 weeks after the injection.

                                                I started feeling groggy after the shot, which seemed normal. By Sunday afternoon, i felt foggy and off like i was in a brain fog. And, Monday, I started feeling vertigo and like I was rocking with a headache. By Wednesday, i was worried because it was impacting my day to day so i went to urgent care. They told me to go to the emergency room, which i did on  Thursday. They did a cat scan, which was clear, tested me for COVID ( negative) and ran bloodwork. I am planning to go to the ENT doctor on Monday, but still feel off and am concerned about getting the second shot next week. My second dose is scheduled for Thursday, March 25th. I have never had vertigo before and I just feel off all day and it started after my vaccine.

                                                Started itching a few minutes after received the shot. Felt slight shortness of breath but wasn?t sure if I was having panic attack or reaction. Took Benadryl and used inhaler and that helped. Around 2pm started having cramps as id period was on but it?s not due for a week. Took advil, it helped. Around 5:30pm severe abdominal cramps, nausea, went to bathroom several times. Arm, neck and shoulder pain. Dizziness and just feel weird. If gets worse tonight will go to ER, if same or better will call doctor in the morning

Joints, muscles etc. The next 3-4 days I could barely get out of bed. Moving was agony. I treated with Advil as I was told to. It waned a bit over the weeks, but after my second shot 3 weeks later, it reared its head back up and I&#39;m in a constant 8/10 on my pain scale Everything hurts. Blood work normal, doctor just shrugs.

                                                Approx 7 hours after receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped significantly. I had an overwhelming feeling as if I was going to pass out and had a pins &amp; needles feeling in my face. I checked my bp and it was 102/70. Over the course of about 40 minutes it slowly went back up and was at 136/84 the last time I took it last night.  I reached out to my pcp to let her know and to see if getting the second dose was safe. She confirmed she believes it was a side effect of the vaccine, but it was safe to get the second dose in 3 weeks.

                                                Starting the night of the vaccine, a lot of constant buzzing in ears, periodic feeling of fullness in ears &amp; sensitivity to loud sounds in ears. Went to sleep. Awakened dry heaving &amp; had vomited some bile. Couldn?t stand or walk due to extreme dizziness &amp; moderate nausea continued. Called PCP and was seen at 1pm on march 26th. My son had to help me walk all day so far. The doctor office checked my vitals &amp; my ears. Vitals good. No infection. Diagnosed with vertigo &amp; prescribed Meclizine. 4p was 1st dose. Seems to be helping some. Nausea has subsided. Buzzing is present, but quieter. Still too dizzy to walk without assistance

                                                I developed numbness that started in my toes which gradually progressed up my legs and then into my hands. This course progressed over a period of 5-6 days. I was initially seen at the Medical Center on 2/8/21 in the ER. Neurology was consulted for my symptoms, suspecting sensory/small fiber acute inflammatory demyelination process such as Gillian Barre Syndrome. At that time, other than the sensory changes, I did not have weakness or ataxia/gait instability, so I was sent home from the ER.   The following day, while I was at work, I had some difficulty with my balance. I had spoken to my Neurologist, and decision was made for a direct admission for IVIG treatment. I was admitted to the Medical Center on 2/9/2021 for a 2 day course of IVIG (receiving a total of 2g/kg dose over the two days). I was d/c from the hospital on 2/11/2021. I did not require any rehabilitation and was discharged home.   Following discharge, I developed painful neuropathy in my feet, and was started on Pamelor for treatment. Due to side effects of the medication, I was switched to Cymbalta which is what I am on now for neuropathic pain. I continue to have numbness in my hands and feet, but it has not continue to progress at this time.

                                                I developed immediate flushing, sweating, rapid heartbeat (was around 110bpm, is normally around 75bpm), and lightheadedness.  I sat down and had a few sips of water.  Within a few minutes, I felt like I was having a difficult time getting a good breath in.   I raised my hands over my head and took slow deep breaths to try and keep my breathing  under control.  I stayed at the hospital for about 45 minutes, over which time I had a few bites to eat and some water.   The flushing and sweating resolved within that time.  The lightheadedness and &#34;feeling of doom&#34; lasted about 3 hours.  I had no anxiety going into this vaccine, nor have I had a reaction like this before.

                                                I received the COVID vaccine on Monday Dec. 21, 2020 at 14:30.  By 17:00 I was not feeling well.  I was tired, had a headache, muscle aches, nausea and a fever of 101 F.   The headache, low grade fever and significant malaise continued through Tues Dec 22 and Wed Dec 23.   On Thursday morning Dec 24 at 2:30 AM, I woke from sleep with the urge to use the bathroom.   I suddenly felt light-headed and dizzy and had a diaphoresis that soaked my hair and PJs.   Fortunately my husband who is a nurse anesthetist helped me through the episode safely and was able to get me back to bed.   I am not sure if that event was related to the vaccine or if I happened to be a little dehydrated and had a vaso-vagal event.  I did not take any medications because I was allowing my body to have a natural response to the vaccine.

Pain is in anterior shoulder and radiates down right arm. Pain is constant but worse with movement. Pain started the night that vaccine was given 1/2/2021 and has been persistent since then making it difficult to work. Pain not relieved with tylenol or ibuprofen. Pain is more severe that what would be expected from needle trauma. Of note, vaccine was given particularly high near subdeltoid bursa.

She got in touch with her provider and was treated with valium and Celebrex. She reported about 2 cm swelling and fatigue. Thirty hours post vaccination, she had pain and swelling and could barely move. Dr. needed to take valium and Celebrex though for those 48 hours, and would have gone to the ER if they had not helped (the pain was that debilitating)

                                                Administration of vaccine was given about 3 inches too low, not sure if it went into muscle or subcutaneous but I did end up with an injection site reaction 2 days later to include a 2x3 inch red, itchy, raised, hot to the touch welt.  Also had extreme dizziness, nausea, headache 2 days after injection.  Dizziness, nausea, headache subsided after 24hrs however injection site reaction will go away and come back randomly.  Seems to coincide with getting sick?  Was fine up until 12/29 when I did end up getting sick to include headache, body aches, chills.  I went to go get covid tested which was negative.  I ultimately had a sinus/ear infection.  However injection site reaction had gone away UNTIL I got sick on 12/29 then it showed up again and still have it as of today.

I tried to read my email and the words were there but didn&#39;t have meaning.  I had to drive home after my 15 minute observation and plugged my home address into my gps so I wouldn&#39;t get lost even though I drove home from Medical Center for years.  I got home and laid down and slept for a couple hours and woke up fine.  I felt ok the following day and was doing laundry around 6 pm and my arm stopped being sore and I got really dizzy and nauseated and my vision had shadows (reminded me of an ocular migraine) and drank 2 x 16 oz glasses of water and laid down and felt better in about 20-30 minutes.

I didn&#39;t have any other symptoms during my 15 min observation period, but when I got to my car to leave the hospital, I had another episode of dizziness that lasted a couple minutes and then stopped. I didn&#39;t have any other incidents of dizziness, but started feeling fatigued and had chills that afternoon. Tuesday evening I had a slight fever, diarrhea, tachycardia, and palpitations. Over night I developed body aches.  Most of the symptoms were pretty much gone within 24 hrs, but the fatigue and tachycardia lasted into Friday. My heart rate was consistently 115-125 bpm from Tuesday evening through Friday.

                                                I have had 4 episodes of dizziness. I do not ever experience dizziness in my daily routine, typically. The first 3 were minor and brief - they occurred while I was standing or walking - I was aware of it and paused, but recovered before having to sit down or stop moving. These occurred between 18 and 42 hours after receiving dose 2 and seemed to be triggered by bending over, getting up and down. The 4th episode happened almost exactly 48 hours after dose 2, occurred 35 minutes into my daily 3 mile walk, and was more significant. I had to sit down by the side of the road and call for my husband to come get me. It has been nearly 48 hours since that episode and I have not experienced any more dizziness since that time.

The administering nurse reported that she did dilute the first dose, but it was unclear based on her description. Patient reported feeling dizzy after administration. Her PCP was called, left message. Told patient to wait for 30 minutes to observe for any adverse events.

                                                I started to feel fatigued and slightly dizzy at 12:30 pm the day I received the shot which would have been about 5 hours after. I also had a low grade fever of 99.2 and arm pain at the injection site. That evening I began to have chills and fever, fatigue, body aches, and nausea. These symptoms lasted until the evening of 1/15/2021. Fever was on and off during that time and ranged from 99.2-100.7.  My arm was very sore during this time and on 1/16/2021 it became very itchy and hot at the injection site so I took Zytrec which helped some with the itching  and was like it this for about 24 hours then subsided.  I did not go to the doctor because my symptoms were not severe and I recovered at home.

                                                ~2wks following first injection, noticed a left submandibular lymph node swelling/tenderness. Following first injection, had occasional transient headache, lightheadedness. ~4 days following the second injection, had an episode of elevated resting and active heart rate for ~1.5hrs. (Normal resting HR is 60-70s, during episode was 100-110s with increase to ~140 with short walk). Following second shot, also had axillary lymph node discomfort, transient on/off headache, lightheadedness, chills, fatigue. My submandibular lymph node has not resolved but HR issue has (why reported as ?no? below).

Treatment was tylenol, ibuprofen, and benadryl.

I had a headache and felt confused, I couldn&#39;t remember what to do. The site was sore, I was dizzy, nausea and tired.  This lasted for about 2-3 days .I took the next day off.  The Dr. at my work said it should go away.

                                                I had very slight nausea soon after the first shot, then started having chills and whole body ache from the night (12/18/2020) for 24 hours followed by spontaneous internal hemorrhage (lower GI, significant blood in stool) in the morning  and in the afternoon of 12/20/2020.  The hemorrhage lasted for about 24 hours.  It started slowing down on 12/21/2020, then stopped.    I was evaluated by Dr., (GI) who was not sure if the bleeding was vaccine induced vs. coincidence on 12/23/2021.  Since the bleeding stopped, she cleared me for the 2nd vaccine and advised me for close monitoring for any other episode of bleeding.  I had some fatigue for about 4-5 days since the first shot, then I felt normalized.    Soon after the 2nd vaccine (in about 5-10mins) on 1/8/2021, I started having some discomfort/pain in lower rib region where spleen is.  Initially I felt like some chest pain, but it was more near spleen region, I think... I also had slight intermittent dizziness for about 2 hours after the 2nd injection.  The discomfort in left lower chest/rib improved and resolved in an hour or so.    Then, similar pattern started including chills and whole body ache on the night of 1/8/2021 followed by internal hemorrhage again (significant blood in stool) in the morning and in the afternoon of 1/9/2021.  The bleeding slowed down on 1/10/2021, then stopped.   I reported it to again my GI doctor on 1/11/2021 who ordered CBC to monitor my platelet level.  The result showed down trending from my baseline.    I think the COVID vaccine transiently affected me with internal hemorrhage and lowering platelets/likely potential thrombocytopenia given the clinical symptoms (spontaneous internal hemorrhage).   Platelet level is improving at this time and I feel normalized today.

Called PCP on the 15th as symptoms were getting worse not better. Patient advised me to go to ED. Went to ED here last Friday and was released. The weakness in legs got much worse and early the following week she started getting the numbness and weakness in arms. She went for the follow up post ED visit with NP at PCP office on 1/20 and due to the continued weakness, after consulting with one of the MDs, decision was made to send her back to ED for further work up to check for GBS including the LP in ED, labs and MRI of head, spine, lumbar and thoracic. Patient was release on Saturday 1/23 and diagnosis was a severe immune response to the vaccine.  Patient still has unsteady gait and weakness.

Pain was significant enough that it prevented me from being able to lift/use that arm/shoulder for several days.  I did not see a physician and self treated at home with nsaids, lidocaine patch, and heating pad.   2) I also had golf ball size swollen lymph nodes under my left arm on day 2 - 4 after receiving vaccine. No treatment needed.

                                                After the first COVID19 shot I got very red and very hot.  I had a blinding headache for days.  I received the shot on a Wednesday afternoon and by Saturday I felt like I could claw my eye out, that I had something in it.  I went to the eye doctor Monday morning and was diagnosed with a corneal ulcer.  After the second COVID19 shot I was watched for 30 minutes based on my first reaction.  I again turned very red and very hot.  I had hives on my arms, neck, and behind my ears.  I felt lightheaded and dizzy.  I received 25 mg Benadryl by mouth and was observed for another 45 minutes.  At that time I walked outside and felt worse.  My throat became very itchy and I kept coughing.  I went back in to tell provider and received an epi pen injection into my right leg, they took my vitals, and sent me to the hospital by ambulance.

                                                My charge nurse told me he was tested positive that evening. Started feeling my throat hurting in the morning. Because of being exposed to my charge nurse I had to go get tested. By 9AM body aches, headache, cough, chills.  Fever went down on Thursday 100.8F, hot and cold sweats. I never felt like that before.  I also had some GI issues (diarrhea) and a little bit of shortness of breath, just by walking to the restroom I would be very fatigued and when I checked my oxygen it would drop to 88% just by walking from my bed to the bathroom (Wednesday and Thursday was the worst). I still have fatigue and my throat hurts a little bit, I have congestion again and I started feverish again this Tuesday and lots of cough. Low grade fever (99.9F). My employee health told me to not return due to my symptoms until they subside or go get checked. Coughing and sneezing restarted yesterday. I had returned to work on Monday but then by Tuesday symptoms started reappearing.

                                                I received the 1st dose of my covid vaccine on Thursday 1/7 at 4pm and during my 15 min observation I started to not feel well, light headed, spacey, eyes blurry. I sat and was observed til approx. 1715 at which time I thought I was ready to head back to my department. After the elevator to the LL I really wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ended up going to the ER which they diagnosed me with Vertigo. I have never had vertigo in the past. I remained in the ER until approx. 2220 until my symptoms were managed with medication and I felt well enough to leave.The lightheaded and dizziness lasted a few days while the headaches lasted about a week.

                                                After about 30 minutes I experience swelling and tingling to my tongue. I also experienced some dizziness.   The swelling and tingling dissipated after about 4 hours, and I took some 20mg PO Pepcid and 10mg Loratidine to see if it would help.  After 6-8 hours the swelling and tingling to my tongue was gone. I reported this to my provider Manaku MD, and she recommended it was fine to get my second vaccine, and she would give me a methylprednisone taper pack for the next vaccine. She states she questions if I have an allergy to polyethylene glycol which I did not believe I did? Unsure of where the reaction could have stemmed from.

                                                The injection of the vaccine was fine.  My arm started getting sore about an hour afterwards.  The next morning I could not lift my arm at all.  About 18 hours after getting the vaccine I had severe body and joint aches, my lymh node in my armpit was swollen and sore (on injection arm), I had a headache, and I was exhausted.  This continued for 48 hours.  The swelling of the lymph node went down and the body and joint pain lessened.  However 5 days after I am still exhausted, dealing with a headache, my arm is still sore, and am experiencing joint pain and back pain.  I was diagnosed with COVID 19 on December 4, 2020, with COVID Pneumonia on Decemeber 13, 2020, and with Post Viral Syndrome on December 28, 2020.

                                                I had a migraine beginning Feb 9 AM. I have chronic migraines that almost always occur on the left side of my head, but this one was on the right side, which is unusual for me. The migraine pain was more severe than normal. I also had a stiff right jaw and eye pain primarily on the right side. I took 100 mg Imitrex in the afternoon of Feb 9 and it reduced the pain very effectively (which is also unusual for me). On Feb 10 AM, the migraine returned or a new one started. The pain was also in the right side. I took 100 mg Imitrex and it reduced the pain somewhat effectively.  The migraine pain returned Feb 11 AM and hurt on both sides of my head. I took 100 mg Imitrex this evening (Feb 11) and it is helping so far. In addition, my left arm was sore around the injection site beginning when I got the shot and stopped this morning.

                                                24 hours after the 2nd dose my temperature rose 4 degrees, full body aches and sweating for 24 hours. Followed by dizziness and headache. Within two days my body began having seizures accompanied with ongoing flushing/cold sensations in the occipital region/top of spine, with a feeling of fainting and dizziness, nausea, without loss of consciousness. Sudden jerking movements of the arms, legs and the head/neck range from 2-5 minutes in duration and continue in clusters for 8-20 hours per day. This seizure activity has not subsided since February 17th, and is ongoing to date. MRI confirms no new structural abnormalities in the brain. CBC and metabolic panels are all within normal range. EKG normal. I am not epileptic. No history of drug use. No alcohol use.

                                                Since the beginning of February, 1 week post vaccine, I have had 3 separate instances where I awake in the middle of the night out of a dead sleep with a racing heart and feel like I&#39;m going to vomit or pass out. It usually subsides within 10 minutes.  I have also been having spells of dizziness during the day, usually 3-5 days each week. I have seen my primary care MD, that diagnosed me with vertigo. I have also been to the ER, who then diagnosed me with anxiety and explained my waking up in the middle of the night as a panic attack. I have never had these feelings with physical symptoms prior to my vaccine. I have never had the COVID-19 virus to my knowledge.

                                                When the injection was placed I experienced deep pain inside my shoulder. Within 3 hours my shoulder was frozen in pain and unable to move. I used ice and anti-inflammatory medication with no relief. I was unable to move my shoulder and could not complete daily self care tasks like brushing hair, changing clothes, cooking or driving. I could not drive to work the next day and had to use sick leave. I was in a high level of pain. I woke up crying throughout the night for three nights due to pain. I sought care at unspecified Urgent Care and was told that it was just sore and I need to keep moving the shoulder and apply heat. I was given an RX for Cephalexin, an antibiotic. Dr. indicated the injection site was warm to the touch. By Wednesday morning, there has been a slight improvement in pain and mobility. I am able to hold my arm straight down as opposed to keeping the elbow bent and tucked in. Still cannot raise my arm at all from the shoulder joint.

A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number and Expiration date was unknown), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date, second dose via intramuscularly in right arm on 16Jan2021 15:30; both at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in workplace clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history included depression, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), latex allergy. Concomitant medications included venlafaxine, L-methylfolate; the patient received both the drugs within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took fluoxetine, citalopram and experienced known allergies for both the drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient experienced debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension on 25Jan2021 06:00. On 01Feb2021, the patient underwent lab test and procedure included nasal swab/ COVID-19 by PCR: Negative. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with IV Dexamethazone, Diphenhydramine, ketorolac, promethazine for all the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: On the basis of the available information, the reported events debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension would seem most likely related to intercurrent and/or underlying medical condition and concomitant medication, which is not related to bnt162b2. This case will be reassessed when additional information becomes available. This impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of  the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At exact time of infection,  whole left arm started getting tingly and warm,  especially from crook of elbow down through fingers. My usual comfortable watch felt tight and annoying.   Was able to walk to observation area,  then started getting dizzy and light- headed.  Still had warm,  tingly feeling in arm that received injection.  My normal resting heart rate is 61 but now it was up to 111 per smart watch (possibly 121 but can&#39;t confirm since I was dizzy and blurry-eyed). In addition to tingly arm,  racing heart,  dizziness,  I felt immediate fatigue and wanted to lay down and sleep. Also,  had dull headache on left-side.  Nurse sat me down and elevated my feet. Also got me some frozen peas for my forehead and neck.  After 12-13 mintues,  I started feeling better.  She kept me under observation for full hour.  Got better and went home.  Heart rate remained elevated at 78-89 rest of evening.  Dull headache remained on left- side only. Similar feeling to when wearing a tight pony tail and you take it out.

                                                About 10-12 minutes after receiving the vaccine, it felt like my heart started to beat fast.  I placed my hand over my chest and I could feel it beating. With a couple minutes I began to feel a little dizzy/light headed. Then a wave of cool came over my body and I was feeling better. I was a little shaky after that. I did not report the syptoms at the time, because I was uncomfortable raising my hand unless I was sure I was really having a serious issue and it did not seem to escalate from there.

After observation period ended, pain in arm was present. Pain intensified over the next hour. Shot was given at 2:45pm. By 4:30pm, I could not move the arm. A simple muscle twitch would send severe pain radiating from neck down to wrist. Pain persisted through the evening and began to improve overnight. Pain was gone by day 4. Treated with Advil, Tylenol and rest. Nausea began on day 2 and still persists along with diarrhea-no vomiting.

The front half of her tongue was swollen and stinging; had white dots and a sore tip on the tongue; Sinus Pressure; Body Aches; Tired; Dizzy; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable licensed practical nurse (LPN) reporting on behalf of physician. A 39-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021, at 39 years of age, (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history; concomitant medications were not reported. On 09Mar2021, a few minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient felt sinus pressure that lasted the rest of the day, she was tired and dizzy for two days and also had nausea for two days and body aches for the first 3 days, all assessed as non-serious. Then the patient stated that when she woke up on 11Mar2021, her tongue was swollen and had white dots and a sore tip on the tongue. The front half of her tongue was swollen and stinging. The patient stated she did not feel as if though her throat was swollen, just her tongue, but it resolved after 3 days. These events were assessed as medically significant and the tongue swelling was what the reporter was mainly concerned about. There were no treatments, no medication was given, the patient was not seen in the Emergency Department, she was not hospitalized and was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. She visited the Physician Office on 15Mar2021 and Physician Assistant advised the patient not to get the second COVID vaccine.

                                                The first abnormal effect I experienced was numbness in my inner upper lip. This was intermittent and lasted roughly 24-48 hours after vaccine administration. Then on 3/25, I had muscle cramping/soreness in my lower leg muscles (calves). The next day (3/26), the muscle soreness continued, and my lower leg muscles began to feel tight when walking. On 3/27, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my right 5th digit, which then spread to all my fingers and toes.  That morning, the muscle soreness had also spread into my thighs and bilateral upper extremities. I also noted mild swelling in my hands and feet and could not put my rings on or wear socks or shoes. By that evening, walking became more difficult as the muscle soreness had now turned into muscle weakness. This prompted me to go the ER for evaluation. A CT scan of my head and lab work was done. I was given IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return to the ER the following day for a MRI of my brain. Overnight, the weakness and swelling in my hands and feet progressed . I became unable to walk, go to the bathroom, or feed my self without assistance. The numbness and tingling I first experienced in my inner upper lip returned, and these symptoms were also now noted in the rest of my face as well. I also began having muscle soreness in my neck, my jaw felt sore when chewing food, and I began seeing some floaters. I returned to the ER the morning of 3/28.  They did more blood work, imaging, as well as a lumbar puncture, and I was admitted to hospital. Once admitted, the hospitalist consulted with another hospital and recommended transfer by EMS there where I was admitted under a neurologist&#39;s care. When I arrived at that hospital, I began to feel somewhat better as the soreness and swelling appeared to be improving, and I could walk without assistance. They did a full neurological workup and kept me overnight for observation. Overnight, I did experience a mild headache that was relieved with Tylenol and rest.  I woke up the next morning  (3/29) with nausea and did have a few episodes of vomiting that turned into dry heaving and was given Zofran with relief. The swelling in my hand went down enough that I was able to make a fist and grasp objects with my fingers again. After the neurologist reviewed my labs and work up the morning of 3/29, I was allowed to return home to await final test results as all my tests were looking normal, my symptoms were continuing to improve, and PT had cleared me to be able to return home. Upon discharge, I was instructed  to not get my 2nd COVID vaccination as it was possible that my symptoms were an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccination as no  other diagnosis was found with testing. I was instructed to follow up with my PCP in one week. Since returning home, I have continued to be very easily fatigued and have had some headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I continue to feel weak when walking and have some muscle stiffness when first waking from sleep. I also continue to have some intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling.

                                                I immediately felt dizzy, like I was drunk. At around 4pm, I started feeling wheezy. It felt like there was a mastiff sitting on my chest. I took some benadryl, which helped. The next day, the feeling persisted and I had a mild cough, especially while lying down. More benadryl. Same on the third day. I did not seek medical attention because I didn&#39;t think it was an extraordinary reaction and I have had much worse reactions to other things in the past that have been managed with benadryl. I thought what I was experiencing was an expected side effect based on the information I had been given. The feeling started to ease by the 4th day, but then the insomnia, mood swings, exhaustion and body aches set in. The cough was sporadic, but still present. Today, I still get the heavy chest feeling intermittently, activity doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect or cause. My arm still itches at the injection site and hurts when touched.  I went back to get my second dose on 4/9. When the nurse asked me if I had had any adverse reactions to the first one, I told her about the chest heaviness and coughing and the other symptoms. She stopped what she was doing and called her medical director. They both decided that the first response was enough of an anaphylactic reaction to be a caution for the second. They refused to give me the second dose because they thought the second would elicit a much worse reaction - possibly to the point of intubation. They told me that I would have to be evaluated by a physician and that I would need a &#34;doctor&#39;s note&#34; in order to get the second vaccine.

A 39-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 18Mar2021 12:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. No known drug allergies. The patient received other concomitant medications within 2 weeks of vaccination (unspecified). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Adverse event started on 18Mar2021 13:15. The patient became dizzy and light headed within 30 minutes of receiving the first dose. The patient believed this was related to her postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).  The symptoms lasted for approximately 12 hours. She also developed symptoms of increased intracranial pressure the morning after she received the first dose.  The patient believed this was related to her pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) and transverse sinus stenosis (TSS).  The symptoms included left sided pulsatile tinnitus and a severe headache. These symptoms lasted for approximately one week.  Then she developed a red circle around the injection site a week after the injection. The patient contacted her neurologist as a result of all of symptoms. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Worsening POTS/Dysautonomia Sx with severe flushing episodes that left me unable to work as a physician for 6wks. The episodes got progressively worse. I eventually ended up on steroids which did improve my symptoms. I was diagnosed officially with POTS and small fiber neuropathy. I attempted to go back to work but became too fatigued and weak to be able to walk, my husband had to come get me and I was taken to his care in a wheelchair. I could not get out of bed for 5 days. I saw rheumatology and am back on steroids. I am now showing lab evidence of lupus. I have polyarthritis and polymyalgia on exam as well as muscle weakness in the quads. I continue to have neuropathy.

Over the next couple of days the numbness was accompanied by weakness and spread to my right buttocks; my right leg and foot; my left leg and foot; my right cheek and top lip on right side of face. I was advised to go to the ER by my doctor; I went to ER. I was kept overnight for observation and discharged with a diagnosis of a pinched nerve. For the length of the following week the numbness, particularly in my legs and feet, became even more intense and I became unable to drive (because I could not use my feet on the floor pedals)...

                                                Joint and muscle pain that is worse than I think is typical. Joint pain was somewhat similar to that caused by ciprofloxacin, in my knees. Muscle pain was intense enough that it caused mobility problems that lasted a few days after the side-effects themselves disappeared. Basically, the side-effects seemed to trigger an Ehlers-Danlos flareup that lasted several days where I was barely mobile. I&#39;ve since recovered and feel normal again.

                                                Itchiness all over her body; Weird taste in her mouth; dizzy; The initial safety information received was reporting only non-serious adverse drug reactions. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 12Apr2021, this case now contains serious adverse reaction. Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: ER8735) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left deltoid on 31Mar2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. Family medical history included that her dad has severe allergies. There were no concomitant medications. On 31Mar2021, after 1st dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, she experienced weird taste in mouth and felt little dizzy both went away immediately, not too concerned. Saturday 03Apr2021 until Saturday 10Apr2021, had itchiness all over her body, she was asking since she had a mild reaction, when she goes next week, if it will be really bad. It was really bad itching, she didn&#39;t think it would go away. Patient thought she had a reaction to the first dose of the covid vaccine, it was not deadly. She was trying to figure out if it was safe to her to get the second dose of the covid vaccine next week. Itchiness all over her body: The only place she did not itch was her hands and feet. Her scalp, back and everything itched. She mostly itched on her torso and scalp. She even itched inside of her ears. She does not take any medications. She was healthy. She has no known drug allergies. She has not started any new products. She kept going about her business, but the itching was getting worse and worse until this weekend. Last Wednesday, 07Apr2021, the itching was so bad that she took a Benadryl to see if it would help. She does not like to take medications. She also used calamine lotion. She took Benadryl children&#39;s dose and it did not help the itching. She thinks that the dose was 10mg, but she does not know for sure. It was a new package, she had just bought it. Benadryl children&#39;s dose did not help at all. All of a sudden, the itching resolved on Saturday, 10Apr2021. She was out a lot in the sun all day Saturday. The sun seemed to help, she does not know if it was related. She did not have any hives. It felt like chicken pox to her but with no pustules. The itchiness all over her body was awful. She does not know. She has never had anything like this happen to her before. Her concern was if she had a mild reaction to the first dose of the covid vaccine, what was going to be like whenever she goes next week for her second dose of the covid vaccine. She was asking if it will be really bad. She was itching so bad that she took a Benadryl to see if it would help. She took Benadryl children&#39;s dose and it did not help the itching. Event itching was reported as serious, medically significant. After reviewing call recording, patient reported when she was at the vaccine facility nothing really major happened, she had a little bit of a weird taste in her mouth, nothing strange. She did get a little bit dizzy but nothing that did not wear off shortly thereafter, so she went about her life normally. The weird taste and dizzy feeling started within minutes of receiving the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. She was lucky enough to work with doctors, so she just talked to them. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a pharmacy. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the event itchiness all over her body was recovered on 10Apr2021, while the other events recovered on 31Mar2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the plausible drug-event temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect product bnt162b2 to the reported pruritus cannot be excluded. Case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.
