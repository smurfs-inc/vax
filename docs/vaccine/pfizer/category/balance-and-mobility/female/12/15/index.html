THE IMMUNIZER OBSERVED THE PATIENT FOR NEARLY 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR TO SEE IF SHE WILL FEEL BETTER. BUT THE PATIENT COMPLAINED THAT THE SYMPTOMS WERE GETTING WORSE. WE REFERRED THE PATIENT TO GO VISIT THE URGENT CARE CLINIC NEXT DOOR AND SEE A PHYSICIAN. LATER, THE PHYSICIAN, TOLD US THAT HE TREATED THE PATIENT WITH PROMETHAZINE AND ONDANSETRON BUT THE SYMPTOMS WERN&#39;T IMPROVING. HE ORDERED MECLIZINE 25MG CHEWABLE TABLETS AND THE PATIENT&#39;S MOM CAME IN TO PICK UP THE MEDICATION. THE PA THINKS IT IS PSYCHOLOGICAL RATHER THAN AN ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK SINCE ALL THE VITALS WERE NORMAL.

About 2 minutes after receiving the shot she lost consciousness and pharmacy staff called 911 for EMTs. She regained consciousness approximately 1 minute later; stated she was a little short of breath. Pharmacist asked her to state her name (was coherent and aware) and asked her to take a breath normally; she was able to do so and could breathe normally with no difficulty. Her father laid her on the floor because she was still light-headed, but could breathe normally. EMT arrived very shortly after and began taking her pulse, checking her pulse-ox, and blood pressure. Pulse was on lower end, blood pressure was around 80/50, pulse ox normal. She was taken to ER per her father&#39;s request for further examination.

Within 10 minutes, her mom asked me to come back there.  I came and her daughter was very sweaty and feeling very dizzy. I asked one of the techs to grab her some apple juice and an ice pack. I had one of my techs call 911.  As I said that, the daughter&#39;s mom  started to pass out on me but I caught her.  She passed out for less than a minute and then she was feeling better.  I put ice packs on mom too. Paramedics took over

Doctors.  &gt;reached over 110%  immunity if not more.  &gt; Both Hematologist I spoke with plus the E.R. doctors determined she was at 100% immunity with just the first dose. &gt; Due to her reaction her Oncologist/Hematologist are communicating with other hematologist in the U.S.  about a reaction of a ?12 year old pediatric patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis?, further research will begin according to the Director of Onoccologist/Hematologist in the next few weeks to help other pediatric patients with Heriditary Spherocytosis in the U.S., the main point of this research is determining that one dose of Covid vaccine reaches 100% immunity vs 2 doses which would be equivalent to ?2 doses plus 2 booster shots of Covid vaccine? to someone with hereditary spherocytosis.  &gt;  &gt; After 8 hours of going through this, she was able to walk and stand. She was back to her old self.  &gt; If you can please reach out to CDC and let them know about a 12 year olds patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis  reaction to second dose of Phizer Vaccine.

                                                After the second dose she had immediate pain at the injection site and over the next 24 hours she developed: A fever of 101.4 severe abdominal pain and chest pain that made her feel like her heart was being pulled out painful electric shocks down her neck and spine that made her walk hunched over numbness and swelling in the arm she got the shot pain in her fingers and toes that turned white and were ice cold to the touch  Over the next 2.5 months her abdominal, muscle and nerve pain became unbearable plus she developed new symptoms:  Fatigue gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting Eventually she couldn?t even swallow food or liquids without immediately spitting it up. An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

Mom reported to pharmacist staff that patient turned pale and felt dizzy. Pharmacist suggested patient to drink water and continued to rest while pharmacist monitored patient. Pharmacist tried to take patient&#39;s blood pressure but pharmacy didn&#39;t have the right cuff so she was  unable to obtain patient&#39;s blood pressure. Patient then was sweating and mom continued to give her water while pharmacist checked patient&#39;s temperature (recorded 94.6&#39;F). Few minutes later, patient vomited. Mom gave patient water after she was done vomiting. Patient reported she felt better afterwards. Patient was monitored for about 15 minutes and she was able to walk herself and left the pharmacy waiting area with mother. Pharmacist suggested mother to call doctor for follow up advice.

                                                This was my daughter&#39;s 2nd dose of the vaccine.  After she got up on the morning of the 12th, I heard her in the shower and went to check on her.  Her face looked gray and she said that she needed to sit down.  After sitting for a bit, she was able to stand up, but then proceeded to fall forward, as if she were passing out.  I was able to steady her and sat her back down.  Her eyes looked like they were staring off into space.  She said that she couldn&#39;t see me and everything was &#34;purple and yellow.&#34;  This lasted a few minutes and then I was able to get her out of the shower and dressed.  She then began to regain some normalcy and was fine after that.  She ate breakfast and rested.  She didn&#39;t have any more episodes after that, but I could tell that she wasn&#39;t as perky that day.  This episode was definitely not normal for my daughter, so I felt that I should report it.

We had a in depth conversation about side effects because she had a headache with the 1st dose. Mom held her hand. A few minutes post, her sister saw that she was slumped over &amp; her eyes had rolled to the back of her head. We tried to wake her up &amp; she was very lethargic. I gave her 2 small bottles of water, pb crackers, 3 hard candies &amp; elevated her feet. Mom said we didn&#39;t need to get medical attention. After about 10 minutes she was still very lethargic &amp; mom said yes to EMS when asked again. Another mom came over &amp; helped us lay her on the floor to elevate her feet above her head. Her husband came in &amp; assessed patient. Her pulse was 60 &amp; when he asked her to squeeze his fingers &amp; press against his feet it was week. She told us that she hadn&#39;t eaten a full meal since the night before, only had watermelon as a snack. The ambulance came &amp; took her.

                                                Patient was a 12 year old female with a weight of 94 lbs who came into the clinic with her father for her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. During the interview, she stated that she did not have any adverse effects with her first dose. At 2:45 pm, after administering her second dose of 0.3 ml of Pfizer vaccine, I witnessed her having trouble standing up and assisted her back down into the seat. She vomited, was pale and diaphoretic. We elevated her legs up onto a bench and began fluid resuscitation. Her first BP was 71/55 and respiratory rate was unlabored. At 3:00 pm her second vitals were BP: 82/69, RR: unlabored, SPO2: 98, HR: 80.  At 3:07 pm her third vitals were BP:83/64, RR: unlabored, SPO2: 99, HR:74. We changed her position from legs elevated to 90 degree angle. Fluids and crackers were still being administered. At 3:16 pm her fourth vitals were BP: 94/76, RR; unlabored, SPO2: 85, HR 67.  At 3:30 pm her final vital signs were BP: 96/74, RR: 14, SPO2: 99, HR: 70. The patient was given a total of 60 oz of fluid and 1 pack of crackers.  I reassessed that the patient&#39;s hemodynamic status improved and her skin was warm and dry. The patient was alert and oriented throughout the process.

We asked if she was okay and asked her to stay for an additional 30 minutes for further observation. She drank some water and ate a snack afterwards. She said she was okay to leave after that and her mother was driving her home.

                                                With the first dose: Headache (came and went frequently) dizzy(2-3 days) nausea (2-3 days) sore arm (3-4 days) gave ibuprofen for about 2 days and most symptoms went away. She continued to complain about a headache every once in awhile. About a week later I noticed  her eyes seemed a little yellow but it didn&#39;t seem to get worse and thought maybe she just need to drink more water and get some sleep.  After second dose: Bad headache (3-4 days) dizzy and nauseous (3 days) gave ibuprofen for 2 days. Two days after the vaccine she was fully jaundice. Hadn&#39;t notice because she was feeling bad from the vaccine so I just let her sleep mostly. Next day we got into see her primary care dr who ordered stat bloodwork and stat ultrasound. That same day she got some blood work back and told us to go to the er because her platelets were really low. At the er they diagnosed her with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which explained the jaundice. She was admitted and put on steroids. Her hemoglobin got as low as 5 and they cross matched her incase they needed to do a blood transfusion. They were concerned that there was a possibility that her immune system would attack the donor blood since it seemed to be attacking her platelets as well. Luckily the steroids started working and he levels creeped up a little. She also recieved 3 vitamin k transfusions and pain meds. When she was switched to oral steroids and her numbers were still rise they released her. She is still taking steroids and has weekly follow ups with Dr. . We are also in the process of getting a rheumatology referral to see if there is an underlying condition we didnt know about.

                                                My daughter experienced on day of her 2nd vaccine, feel nauseated in the evening time, then the second day. Felt very lethargic, fatigue, laying in bed all day, sleeping. She still had nausea also experienced chills, highest temp 99.8F. Her arm pit on the right side where she got the vaccine was really sore. She basically like within a couple of days she started her period cycle again and it was very heavy and lasted one week and half almost two weeks. On 06-08-2021, at about 10pm, she was brushing her teeth when she saw black spots and she went to tell me. At about 11:30pm that night, she squatted to pat our dog and when she got up and she felt really dizzy, lightheaded so I got concerned. Her symptoms persisted and I scheduled an appointment with her pediatrician on 06-15-2021. The pediatrician ruled out anemia. Her pediatrician said she has Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Her pediatrician said that this is something manageable, she needs to strengthen her calf muscles and drink lots of water. They monitored her heart pressure and blood pressure.  Her heart rate had increased to 40bpm.  I also gave her Ibuprofen medication after the vaccine. Leading to today she has been having dizziness and light headiness every single day. My daughter is still  experiencing  symptoms, dizzy and light headed today.   For her 1st vaccine- within few days after her 1st dose, she experienced when using the treadmill, she would feel very dizzy. I did not think anything of it at first and this happened three times then it stopped. She also had a sore arm.

                                                Five minutes after dose my daughter began to feel dizzy, felt like fainting and blurry sight.  We were still at the pharmacy, I asked the pharmacist about her symptoms, about 15 minutes later, she told me she was feeling better, so we left.

She had pressure behind her eyes, muscle pain,she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills , sore throat, nauseous, caller states she was assuming hives, inflammation stayed around awhile , body aches / pain through her head and back down her neck, trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful , she was slumpy, swelling from the digging and scratching, her hands began to swell yesterday in Jun2021. she woke up and said her face felt funny on 09Jun202. she was just not feeling right and couldn&#39;t walk by herself on Jun2021, Caller relays her daughter will be (withheld) . HCP: Caller states she called the pediatrician office and 1 was by phone and she was seen by this provider yesterday and she encouraged her to reach out to us as well. Mom states she was aware of the possible symptoms to occur and her daughter came home Tuesday perfectly fine and went to bed and woke up with the typical symptoms, she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills, sore throat, nauseous and had all the symptoms pretty much. States she didn&#39;t have anything weird going on during the observation time the day of the vaccine. Caller relays her daughter didn&#39;t have anything weird after her 1st dose. Caller states she took a nap Wednesday about 24 hours after her 2nd dose and she woke up and her lips had begun to swell and she woke up and said her face felt funny and it was itchy. Caller states she was assuming hives. Caller states that there was nothing concerning as it wasn&#39;t in that initial 15minutes to 4 hour and that this occurs 24 hours after and that was a concern. Caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch and that was kind of along the same lines and said hives and she would itch itch itch and there was swelling from the digging and scratching. Caller states she has numbness in her lip with the swelling. Caller states the other symptoms that are bizarre is more yesterday and it started some on Wednesday she had a pressure in her chest and this was a child, her daughter was very strong, she got up yesterday and tried to do school and had a fever of 102 and Wednesday evening was so sick with symptoms and she still tried. Caller states the pressure in her chest is concerning and told them yesterday and she needed to be seen. States her daughter described it to the doctor that it felt like someone was sitting on her chest sort of pressure and on a scale of 1-10 she was a 7. Caller provides that not at any time did she experience trouble breathing and she never saw her lose or get weird coloring. Caller states she called her doctor Wednesday afternoon and talked to another doctor, that she called the help line after hours as they close 4:30 or 5pm. States she was told it was good news that she did not have trouble breathing but to have it at this point was weird and no one knows what to expect and everyone is different. States she was told to do Benadryl and continue with pain medication for fever and discomfort. Caller states her daughter was miserable the rest of the evening. Caller relays that the swelling subsided and the inflammation stayed around awhile and yesterday she woke up better with no nausea and the common symptoms are better and she still had the fever. Caller relays that at about 9:00 she began to have a problem where she said that behind her eyes she had significant pressure and that scared the caller what with the brain and swelling. Caller states her hands began to swell yesterday, like her lip and her fingers are itchy and swelling and it&#39;s constant itching and the pressure on her chest yesterday, that those 3 things freaked the caller out and she called the pediatrician and they said to have her checked out to make sure as nobody wanted to rush her to the ER as she was not struggling to breathe she was just not feeling right. Caller states the pediatrician did her research about heart inflammation and listened to her heart a couple of times and said her best observation for rubbing sounds was she did not hear any. Caller states when her daughter was younger she had meningitis and went through a whole lot with that and caller states she does not immediately rush to the hospital as that brings back emotions with that. Caller states the doctor said she didn&#39;t see any immediate distress and would do an EKG or they could wait and see, that she thought the pressure might be like body aches and her daughter had laid in bed all day the day before and had a time with it. Caller states she couldn&#39;t walk by herself and she was out of it. Caller states she could do the EKG or wait until today and they chose to wait. States that today she seems better and the only thing today is the continuing pressure behind her eyes that her daughter described as it felt like someone had 2 spoons and was trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful. Caller relays her daughter has been through meningitis pain and has pain through her head and back down her neck and the concern is swelling. Caller states it could be a weird reaction and the doctor thinks it is a weird headache she is having and is still doing ibuprofen. Caller relays that her chest is not nearly as heavy today and she has taken Benadryl again for itching and swelling. States the doctor says they don&#39;t know what did it because the risk was there and the benefit and don&#39;t want to get reactions. Caller states she had no problem with getting the shot, that weird things happen and the pediatrician is saying it can happen but doesn&#39;t know. States it is kind of scary. Caller states they checked her out and they checked her oxygen and blood pressure and that made the caller feel better. States that 9:30-10 last night after she got home she was slumpy and her head was hurting and she had chest pressure. Caller states with the hand swelling, that the caller herself went through reaction and hives and the doctor had asked if her daughter had anything new introduced and no nothing was and her daughter didn&#39;t seem concerned to share this but after her 1st dose her hands itched and she didn&#39;t pay it any mind. States she had no face swelling. Caller states she is wondering if those little hand itches after the 1st dose she didn&#39;t tell about till now was that a little bit of a sign that something else was there. States she didn&#39;t mention it after the 1st dose and was good to go. States after the 2nd dose she said mommy my hands itched after the 1st dose, her lip didn&#39;t swell and she told the doctor it&#39;s not conditions on the list of symptoms and she didn&#39;t have breathing issues. Caller states it&#39;s a non severe reaction and is assuming to dose and said yesterday if she gets a booster what does Pfizer advise. Caller states they have all intention of getting what she needs in the future. Caller states she wants to make sure she doesn&#39;t have worse and the lip swelling was freaky. Caller states she thought her daughter was out of the woods after the 20 minutes waiting and was home and then turned. Caller states it was pretty straight forward and knew what the expected symptoms were and they were fine and knew she was having the exact ones on the list and was not feeling well and had a fever. States she was thrown for a loop when others came up and the fact that they were 24 hours out, that she got the 2nd dose 4-4:15 on Tuesday and these evolved well after that time. Caller said they said to report this and her hope is that they can help if someone else has this issue. States when she said she was laying there my hands did itch after the 1st but not like this to this degree. States she never said anything and caller didn&#39;t know. States she knows as a parent there are certain questions to ask and warning signs of potential allergic reactions. Caller states she is assuming this is some sort of allergic reaction, not the worst kind but pressure in the chest and other concerns about her heart having some sort of issue she knows have been reported.Caller states that today she could have done the EKG for more information but based on her listening and what she wanted to thinking the body aches and extensive issues with that she is glad she waited. States she was laying in bed at 6:30 and asked her if she wanted to get the EKG and she said she was afraid of going to the hospital and it&#39;s not fun but would give answers if there is something else and she laid in bed until 9:30-10 and gave her more Benadryl and Ibuprofen and continued with that for the discomfort behind her eyes and the doctor is thinking it&#39;s body aches. States the fever subsided yesterday.Caller states she would like to share that her daughter is a tough kid and tough kids can be taken down too and may not pay attention. Caller states she doesn&#39;t over react but she is aware and if she had told her about her hands she would have thought allergic reaction, mild one and brought her to the doctor or at the 2nd vaccine and she didn&#39;t say anything until after the fact. Caller relays her daughter has never been through hives and the caller has and has a lot of seasonal and environmental allergies and the caller was that kid. Caller states with her daughter not having seen her lip swell and her eyes started hurting and she started thinking the worst. States the doctor pushed on her and checked her lymph nodes and did a thorough exam that lasted about 30 minutes and nobody knows. States she appreciates all that Pfizer and the other companies have done, that we need this.Caller states her daughter goes to the pediatrician in 2 weeks for her annual check up. States the doctor yesterday said her body responded and had a hard time with it. States she does the flu shot every year and this was weird and she wanted us to know and hopes this report can help. Caller states her daughter is a tough kid nobody knows and today she is better, she has a headache behind her eyes still there.Caller relays that Friday she had her annual eye check up and it&#39;s not a vision thing, that was fine until Wednesday and other other stuff and yesterday with pressure and she is sure it&#39;s residual and her body adjusting and if she can help with letting other people know.Caller relays if it comes back she is going to do the EKG, that she is not the parent to say it is nothing and will follow through with Pfizer also. Caller states she didn&#39;t have anything weird for heart beat and no rubbing sound and no signs and she thinks it was issues from body aches and hopefully she is on the up and up and nobody will have to leave and go to the doctor today. And didn&#39;t think because it was not an immediate issue with her breathing and nothing like that and didn&#39;t think it would be an issue with a booster. Caller states it could be that instead of sitting for 20 minutes they keep her longer and that when she fills out the sheet if was not an option, she knows there is severe reaction listed, she will make notes and make the person giving the dose aware that she had the delayed what they are believing to be allergic reaction and make sure, that she may never have it again and it could have been her system was so under attack. Caller states she doesn&#39;t understand vaccines and knows it&#39;s the body&#39;s job to do something and she is not reluctant helping her be immune and she understands what to do in the event and doesn&#39;t have an epi pen and her daughter has no allergies and no reactions to anything. Caller states she didn&#39;t have the worry, that there is always a chance and you worry when something foreign goes in the body that there is a chance to react. Investigations: Caller states they listened to her heart and took her vitals and tests with her fingers checking her eyes to make sure her pupils were dilating correctly and move her eyes with a moving finger. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know the medical term but the basics and let them know she was not in dire straights to rush to the hospital immediately. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 102 fahrenheit, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, vital signs measurement was unknown and unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lip swelling and numbness, itching on face, hands and feet / caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch, pressure on her chest , fever, swelling from the digging and scratching. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Patient was walking around the pharmacy approximately 10 minutes after receiving her first COVID vaccine where she felt lightheaded and passed out into a shelf. By the time pharmacist and technician were with the patient, the patient was awake and oriented. Offered to call 911, both patient and mother refused. Gave patient a Gatorade and a chair to relax before leaving the store.  Patient was able to walk out on her own and felt fine.

                                                Patient received her 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine around 11:20am, and started feeling bad within about 5-7 minutes of administration.  Her grandmother came to the counter to alert me that she wasn&#39;t feeling well, patient was lightheaded and just &#34;felt bad&#34;.  She did say she was nauseous, but was very agitated and had trouble verbalizing what was wrong.  She was very hot and clammy, her mother reported that she looked very pale.  I went to get a cuff to take her blood pressure, but by the time I got it on her arm, she was slumping significantly in the chair, so we decided to move her back to the clinic room to lay her down and elevate her feet.  Her mother and I each took an arm to move her.  I thought she may have briefly lost consciousness, her legs were not holding any of her weight, but her head was down, so I couldn&#39;t tell if she was alert.  We moved her a few more feet into the room and her mother moved to set her down in a chair, she was talking and alert.  At this time, her bladder evacuated and she vomited, her mom moved her the rest of the way to the chair. I immediately went back to the room with them and dialed 911 at 11:34am.  She was more alert at this time, did not report any difficulty breathing or any swelling or itching of the mouth or throat.  She was very anxious/agitated, but she did say that she felt a little better after vomiting.   EMS arrived at 11:52, I believe she vomited again before they got here, she did take a few sips of water.  EMS left at 12:06pm, the patient and her mother left at 12:07, she was walking on her own, with support from mom.

                                                Friday, 5/21 around 11:55 she received her first dose.  20 minutes later she complained that it felt like someone punched her in the face, and her left cheek was swelling.  She looked woozy, with her eyes closing, and the nurses laid her down on the floor on a mat.  Her tongue and throat began swelling, and she was having extreme difficulty breathing.  She then could not feel anything from her neck down, like she was paralyzed.  The nurse administered an Epipen and EMS showed up minutes later.  In the ambulance, EMS administered another Epipen, gave her a steroid and Benadryl and rushed her to the hospital.  Once at the ER, she was still having a hard time breathing, and could not feel anything from the waist down and could not move her legs.  She also complained about her spine being in extreme pain around the mid to lower back.  When her symptoms did not resolve, she was admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment.  She had extreme pain in her joints - spine, hips, knees, ankles and toes, if someone tried to move them, she could not move on her own.  She also had tingling and numbness that would travel up and down her body - weakness in her arms and legs.  The medical staff continued with Bendryl - switched to Adderax, and Motrin and steroids (Prednisone?).  She was discharged from the hospital Sunday, 5/23/21 in the afternoon.  This morning (Monday 5/24/21) she is still experiencing back and leg pain, weakness and cannot walk with out assistance and it is extremely painful.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Covid vaccine without a problem. She was reading a magazine in a chair while waiting for me (her mother) to have the second dose in the same room. About 5 to 10 minutes has passed since patient had received her injection. I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Patient was given the Pfizer vaccine intramuscularly in her left arm. As soon as the needle was withdrawn her eyes rolled over and she slumped in her chair. We ( myself, her mother and her father) where in the process of placing her on the floor when she indicated that she wanted to get up. We placed her back into her seat and her mother proceeded to rub her back. I asked her if she needed anything but she declined. I kept her for observation for 30 minutes monitoring for any signs of shortness of breath, wheezing or swelling of the tongue or throat. No symptoms were observed. I advised her mother to notify patient&#39;s pediatrician of the incident and then released the patient.

Patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced &#39;she is little dizzy&#39; on 15Ma2021. Patient&#39;s clinical course is as follows: It was reported that the patient was 13-years-old and got Pfizer shot this afternoon about 5 o&#39;clock. Now patient stated &#39;she is little dizzy&#39;. Reporter stated &#39;And I don&#39;t know is it related to that or not I just wanted to ask&#39;. Reported also mentioned that &#39;Yes. In certain places you get that at 13&#39;. When concern was paraphrased the reporter stated &#39;Yes&#39;. When information about department was given, reporter stated, &#34;Are they are there now?&#34;. Reporter was informed about Pfizer drug safety role and asked for permission to probe further questions, reporter stated, &#34;Honestly I would like to go to site cause it&#39;s 12 o&#39;clock midnight here, it&#39;s little late&#34;. When probed for lot and expiration, reporter stated, &#34;It&#39;s not on the card. Oh 1st dose Pfizer, EW0185&#34;. Outcome of the event was unknown.

So I went out with my daughter at 3:00 p.m. She and stood in line at clothing store after walking for an hour and a half and then suddenly she felt dizziness and 20 seconds later she lost consciousness. And then she woke up a minutes later while an employee called 911. She was fine and felt well but when we came back to our house, she was tired and slept 15 minute in my car. The next day, my daughter was fine, but after dinner we walk out near my house after 10 minutes she felt dizziness again.  She sat there for 10 minutes and she was fine. After that day, there were no symptoms.

                                                Pt received first dose on May 14. Initially, we did not think side effects. Pt did complain of getting dizzy when standing up, but we did not think was related. We thought it was from her methotrexate. Pt received her second dose on June 6. On June 7, Pt had chest pain, tachycardia, and did not feel right. We went to Hospital. Pt was admitted because of the high pulse rate and nausea and vomiting. It appears that the vaccine triggered POTS.  This is an update to my report that I filled out in the hospital a few days ago

Google says it is due to lower blood pressure.

She said her throat felt swollen.  A couple hours after a double dose of benadryl and ice packs she began to improve.   4th day she was much better. We spoke with her allergist over the phone, and he said it was reasonable to chalk the reaction up to extra stress on her body due to the vaccine/her bodies response to the vaccine. We only did half her peanut dose. 5th day she was normal.

                                                Around 7PM on June 19th, she had chest pain and chest pressure. She also had a mild headache. She was taking a walk in the neighborhood and had to come home because she was experiencing shortness of breath and having difficulty breathing. She described it as an electric shock/shooting pain in her chest area, on both sides. I took her (the participant) to the ER. While at the ER, she started to feel experience pain and tingling in her left thigh. It would feel better if her leg was elevated. The leg pain subsided by the 20th. On the 21st, she was taken back to the ER because the chest pain and shortness of breath was not subsiding. They did another EKG which showed no abnormalities. Blood work came back with the same indication of virus/inflammation. They gave her a pain med (not sure of the exact name, but it is used for patients after surgery) and an IV. Also given a prescription for 27ml of ibuprofen with Tylenol in between. Two days later, on the 23rd, she had an appointment with the pediatrician. The doctor checked muscle tone and listened to her chest. My daughter gets fatigued by going up a single flight of stairs. Doctor referred her to a pediatric cardiologist. Later that night of the 23rd, she began to get a tingling sensation in her left arm that went down to her hands and lightheadedness. She was not able to move and had to lay down. Being upright made the pressure in her chest worse and she had to take shallow breaths. I took her to the ER. They did a chest x-ray that showed no abnormalities. Referred her for an echo cardiogram on the 24th. She was doing better after that until July 5th, when the pressure and pain started getting worse again. I took her to the pediatrician again and they referred her to rheumatologist on the 11th of July. The rheumatologist prescribed a steroid medication to calm her immune system. She said her immune system was activated and was inflamed, which is why she was experiencing the shortness of breath and pain. She prescribed her colchicine and Aleve. Since she has started to take the meds, she is doing better but she is still experiencing pressure at a lesser level. The pain is the same level that feels like static shock.

However, she continued shopping in store with her family.  On the way out, she was still feeling lightheadness and her vision was lessened so she sat down at the food court area.  Pharmacist was alerted to come attend to her.  Pharmacist suggested that she put her head between her legs and offered wet towel for her neck.  After about 5 minutes, she said she was fine to go with her family.

After about 5 minutes of sitting in the chair for her 15 minute observation, her mom said she felt nauseous and like she was going to pass out.  She was laid her back in the chair.  The patient&#39;s mother went to get orange juice.   She was pale and her eyes were rolling back in her head.  She did pass out for a few seconds, and I checked the patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure.  BP 139/58, pulse 53.  By that point she was coming back around.  After she sat for several minutes and had orange juice and water, she was feeling much better.

Pharmacist gently moved patient to her side on the floor and brought knees up to her chest while technician called 911.

She was standing in our kitchen at home and became dizzy and started falling backwards. She said her vision was black, she was hot, her head hurt, I could see sweat on her face and chest, and she said she was having tightness in her chest/not able to get full breaths. She didn&#39;t totally lose consciousness, but she was disoriented. These symptoms lasted a few minutes, then she felt fine.

                                                I administered the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to the patient (14 year old) she was very anxious, after giving it to her she sat in the post-IMZ waiting area on the chair. Her mother was next to her. In a few minutes she told her mother she was feeling dizzy and started to fall off the chair. Her mother caught her and yelled to us for help. We called code white and 911. She  recovered in a few minutes and he gave her an ice pak as she was hot. She sat on the floor with her mother. She stood up after she felt better and sat on the chair and then she got pale again and looked like she was about to faint again. The fire department had arrived and they checked on her. By then she was a lot better. They decided that it was not necessary to call an ambulance and went home. We gave her a bottle of water. I followed up with the mother at 7 pm and she was doing a lot better

                                                Patient developed dizziness and coldness in extremities. She tried walking and fell down, but did not lose consciousness. She then alternated between feeling hot and cold and seeing &#34;blurry spots&#34;. I noticed her lips turning white and she said she needed to lie down. I got her water and ice packs since she was sweating. We sat on the floor for about 10 minutes, then she was able to move to a chair for another 5-10minutes and then left the facility. Mom reports that she has been lethargic and napping most of the day. Patient ate a few cheez-its for breakfast and reports that she did not get a good nights sleep last night.

She was offered water and hard candy while waiting for the paramedics to arrive. She took a small amount of each, but declined anything else from the store. She seemed to be in significant distress and had difficulty moving to the immunization room where she would be out of view from others in the store. Parmedics arrived and checked her vitals and said those looked ok, so they didn&#39;t seem concerned. Patient still seemed very unsteady when leaving, but did say that her vision had improved. Patients were advised to keep a very close eye on her.

                                                Pt received her 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine in the right arm at approximately 2:45 PM on May 29 at pharmacy. Pt was recommended to sit for 15 minutes in the waiting area after vaccination for observation, but she and mom opted to go shopping in the store. At approximately 3:37 PM, pt and mom came back to the pharmacy to tell me (the pharmacist) that she had hives and showed me red bumps on her left arm. I had the pt sit while mom went to go buy Benadryl. After 5 minutes, I checked on the pt. She had taken one dose of Benadryl and stated that she was dizzy and feeling itchy all over. After chatting with mom for 5-10 minutes, the pt stated that she felt like her symptoms were not worsening and were stabilizing. The pt then said she wanted to rest at home. I recommended she sit for a little longer, but mom stated she would keep a close eye on the pt and had an epipen at home. They then left the pharmacy. I followed up with mom on May 30th at approximately 4:00 PM to see how the pt was doing, and she stated that they were at the ER because the symptoms were not getting any better, and the pt &#34;felt like she was having an asthma attack.&#34; Pt&#39;s mom states that the pt is doing much better after receiving IV meds.

Suddenly I looked up, I noticed her body stiffened and her eyes closed. she tumbled to the floor and hit her head on the ground. Paramedics were dispatched immediately.  patient woke up right away, we checked her pulse, forehead for fever, and back of her head for any possible bleeding.  She answered all questions that we asked of her correctly (such as her name, her age, etc.) Paramedics arrived, took her blood pressure, oxygen level (both normal), blood sugar (normal). Parents decided to take her to hospital for further evaluation.  I called and spoke to Dad 5 hours later, dad stated that she is doing fine.

                                                Patient felt dizzy immediately after the shot was given.  She said she was going to pass out, and did for about 10 seconds.  She was sitting up in a chair during this time, with her mom holding her up.  She came to, the about 20 seconds later, she passed out again for another 10 seconds.  She came to, and was given some water to drink, but 20 seconds after that she threw up the water.  I took her blood pressure, and it was 60/40, with a pulse of 60.  She was very pale.  After resting in the chair and taking deep breaths, her color returned and she felt much better.  she also said her vision wasn&#39;t blurry anymore.  Ten minutes later, she left with her mom, feeling ok.  She was very anxious about getting the shot, and told me she had passed out in the pass after giving blood.

                                                Patient came in with her father to get 2nd Pfizer vaccine. Patient stated with the first shot, she felt a little dizzy but then it went away. Her father said she was nervous/anxious to get this vaccine. Patient got the vaccine first, then sat in the observation chair while her father got his vaccine. While her father got the vaccine, I checked on her and she said she felt a little dizzy. Patient agreed to put paper towel on back of neck and wrists. As soon as her father finished his vaccine, we moved her to the immunization room to monitor her (such as blood pressure - readings given to paramedics.) Her heart rate was a little high (I believe 107), then  went back to normal. However then her blood pressure started getting lower (around 80/40s) and began feeling worse. Laid patient down with feet elevated and called 911. By the time ambulance arrived, her blood pressure was starting  to improve. Her father agreed with ambulance to bring her in to get checked out.

                                                My daughter was receiving her second vaccine about 1230pm  and while administered she immediately told me she felt ?dizzy and nauseous.? We sit down, she is not feeling better and within 3 minutes or so she said she felt? dizzy and feel like I?m going to throw up.? She then starts nodding off and on, not able to keep her eyes open. I waved over for help and by the time volunteers got to her she went limo and passes out. She was taken by wheelchair to medic room and they had her lay down. She came alert and said ?everything went black? and had no memory/recollection or awareness of where she was and how she got to the medic room. We gave her water and I asked for crackers and she felt better and was able to leave around 115pm.  In addition, we saw a teenage male pass out prior to my daughter and was also taken by wheelchair. I spoke with a RN as I was leaving and was told multiple teens had had the same initial reaction today.  She had no reactions or side effects with her first dose.

We gave her some glucose tablets and she seemed to get better afterwards.  I did a pulse oximeter on her her and her pulse and oxygen was normal.  I offered mother if she wanted me to call 911 and she said no.  I counseled mother and the girl to monitor how she is feeling and to seek 911 or urgent care if she gets worst throughout the day.  The girl left the store feeling okay.

We cleared the area and put ice packs on her forehead and behind her neck and put some fragrance in front of her to smell which woke her up. Once she woke up her dad lifted her back into the consultation room and we had her lay down and put her feet on a chair. She was lying down for about 10 minutes then we gave her gatorade and she said she felt better. Once she got up, I asked her to remain seated in our waiting for another 15 minutes before leaving.

A contactable consumer (mother) reported that a 14-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Jun2021 (Batch/Lot number was reported as EW &#39;O or 0&#39; 186) at the age of 14-years-old as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. No family medical history of seizure. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on an unknown date at Arm Left for covid-19 immunisation. The reason for the transfer today (03Jun2021) was that her 14 year old daughter immediately after getting her second dose of the COVID vaccine started shaking, experiencing fever and fallen unconscious and collapsed and was taken to the hospital and she wanted to go ahead and report those adverse side effects for her. She (patient) was 14 year old and she got her second vaccination today and few minutes after she got it, she stood up and she said she was not feeling well and then the next thing reporter knew like her eyes go back, she do not seem conscious and she was shaking as if, looks like she was having a seizure and then she fell down and she was not conscious, so she fell down, she is still twitching. She has no history of like seizures but that is like twisting and now she was taken to the hospital. So, the hospital treated her as if she had a concussion. Reporter have reported to them that she looks like it was a seizure before she fell down, into her head. Reporter further stated &#34;That day was her second shot and like I said she stood up, she got up from that, she said that she got funny and that I can see where she just kind of lost consciousness, eyes going back, shaking as if she was having seizures and then she fell down and she was unconscious and she is like still moving as if she is having a seizure and she was taken. Reporter stated, &#34;it was a like a seizure but it is like over and she had concussion like falling on the ground but it appears like a seizure, that was a immediate thing.&#34; For treatment, reporter stated that &#34;Any treatment, No. She was taken to the hospital and the hospital needs to write it down and I don&#39;t understand that, the hospital wrote down concussion but the hospital they took the vital signs and she had low blood pressure.&#34; For the date when patient went to the hospital, reporter stated &#34;That was today, June 3rd and she is discharged. The reason she was taken was potential seizure and it was concussion and it was after she fell, she passed out and had low blood pressure. The outcome of the events was unknown. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient received vaccine. As she walked out of the consult room she felt dizzy and described that she thought she blacked out. She fell into a plastic room divider and went to the ground. Her dad was right there and hoisted her upright. Offered to call ambulance but patient&#39;s dad declined and reported that she had history of being squeamish and had passed out from needles before. Patient was breathing and quickly began responding verbally. Her dad picked her up and she sat upright in a chair. Took patient&#39;s blood pressure, provided water, and had patient sit. First blood pressure reading was low (90s over 40s). Offered to call ambulance again. Patient&#39;s dad declined. Patient drank water and juice. Retested blood pressure about 15-20 minutes later and it  was 116/65 and patient reported that dizziness had subsided. Patient&#39;s dad had left message with doctor&#39;s office to report what had happened and to see if they wanted her to come in to be seen today. Encouraged him to do that and seek medical attention if anything worsened.

                                                Within 2 hours of the vaccine, patient was experiencing nausea and general feeling of unwellness. Within 3 hours, patient had a fever of 99.9. At 11 pm, patient had a fever of 100. Mother administered Tylenol and patient went to bed. Patient woke up around 4:30 am with her whole body shaking uncontrollably. Mother heard her stirring and went to check on her. Her temperature was 100. Mother sat and talked with her and offered a snack, drink, and more Tylenol. Mother checked her pulse, which was normal. Patient was coherent and able to communicate. Mother left the room to get snack and drink and heard something fall over in patient&#39;s room and Mother called out and waited a few seconds for a response. Patient did not respond. Mother went back in the room, as it was unusual for patient not to respond, and found patient sitting back up and placing her head in her hands, stating in a panicked voice that she felt she was going to throw up and that she was very hot and that her head hurt really bad. Patient stated that her ears felt weird and everything went black and she somehow fell over from a sitting position on her bed to laying on her bed and had landed on the dog. Patient was unaware that she had knocked over her water bottle and had no recollection of the loud sound it made as it fell over (unusual because loud sounds are very startling for her). The shaking subsided to a tremor a few minutes after the black out. Patient then reported feeling very cold and her temperature had risen to 101. Patient complained of an extreme headache and continued nausea. Mother took patient to Urgent Care, who performed bloodwork and an EKG, and then referred patient to the Emergency Room for an EEG.  ER repeated EKG and declined to do EEG and told patient to follow up with her doctor in 5 - 7 days.

Patient has history of vasovagal response to vaccines and had doctors order to get this vaccine. Patient was not unconscious that we are aware of.

                                                After vaccination, patient stood up and walked around the room. She started bouncing and acting a little nervous. I asked if she was feeling light headed woozy, she said a little bit. I sat her back in the chair. After about 30 seconds she fell sideways to the arm of the chair then slouched forward. I caught her before she went all the way to the floor and leaned her back into the chair, she then seized for approximately 3-5 seconds. Grandpa (legal guardian) was in the room and helped me get her to the floor where she came out for a few seconds and opened her eyes for 5-10 seconds passed out again then seized again for 3-5 seconds. She then woke up on the floor and was alert and looking around.  She was very pale, I elevated her feet for a while and had her lay on the floor for 7-10 minutes.  I then had her sit up on the floor and provided a bottle of water and put cold compress on the back of her neck.  She stayed seated on the floor for about 5-7 minutes before I had her move to the chair to sit again with back against the back of the chair. She continued to sit there sipping water and talking for 7 minutes or so. Learned at this point that patient had not eaten breakfast and has passed out after a vaccination in the past (had not marked on the intake form). After 7 minutes or so, had the patient try to stand. She said her legs were wobbly, so I had her sit back down for several more minutes. Her coloring was much better at this point.  After another several minutes we tried standing again and she felt better at that point. Had her just stand in the room for about 3 minutes before walking to the waiting room. Had her then sit in the waiting room for 5 minutes then she walked out with grandpa. They were going to get breakfast. Grandpa was going to call MD to discuss the events and follow up as necessary as well as to discuss plan going forward concerning the second dose.

She said she has her menstrual cycle and it has never been this bad. She said she didn&#39;t get it last month at all. Prior to this, she said her cycles were normal. She also had pain in her thighs and trouble breathing which resulted in her needing her rescue inhaler.  At this time she has been given ibuprofen and is resting with a heating pad. I as pts. mom am concerned that this may be related to vaccine.

                                                Client received her 2nd dose Pfizer COVID vaccine this afternoon at our offsite clinic by a LPN. Had just asked for a bandaid because there was a spot of blood where she had received the vaccine. Her sister reports she said she was feeling dizzy then her sister turned away and the client fell from standing position to the ground at 1412. Hit on her right side, shoulder and face. Lost conscious momentarily and together with family members we rolled her onto her back. I directed co-worker to call 911. Client came to and we helped her to sit up against the wall. Blood pressure 96/52, P 80 at 1415. Family and client denied history of seizures or fainting. Weather outside hot and client reported she hadn&#39;t eaten anything all day. Water provided. Client reported pain from the right side of her face and her lower lip which had a laceration from the fall that was bleeding a small amount. Fire EMS arrived just after 1420. Reported their vitals as BP 110/68, P 97, O2 99%. Ambulance arrived around 1430 and assessed. They had her rise from sitting to standing and reported her SBP dropped to the 70s. Paramedics advised to be assessed in ER. Client left in ambulance at 1443 accompanied by mother. Family provided reassurance regarding syncopal episode and contributing factors. They had no further questions or concerns at time of departure.

She then started feeling dizzy and looked like she was going to pass out and he caught her and he laid on her on the floor on a pillow.   There was a off-duty paramedic to assist her and they suggested to call 9-1-1 and they showed up 5-6 minutes later.  She was then taken to Hospital.  They ran a lot of laboratory tests, urinalysis and everything was negative.   Her white blood cell count was high and her URC&#39;s and UBC&#39;s were high.  Her albumin was also high.   She was then released from the ER and was told to FU with PCP within 2 days.  She is still having the symptoms of headache, sore throat, and achy bones, the typical flu-like side effects.   She is taking Tylenol for the symptoms, as well as cough drops for her throat.

After she came to we helped her to a chair and sat her down, advised her to put her head between her knees, and got her some water that she requested.  After a few minutes she appeared rather pale and went to ask her if she was ok and she asked for a trash can because she felt like she was going to be sick.  We gave her a garbage bag and she did get sick in the garbage bag.  We kept an eye on her for another 15-20 minutes and she stated that she felt better and that she thought she was ok to leave.   We offered her help to her car but she denied it saying she would be ok with she walked slowly.  Her father was with her the entire time.  While talking with them the father did state that she had incidents like that in the past where she stood up too fast and got light headed and passed out.

                                                First symptom was dizziness and nausea. Then, immediately began sweating profusely . Then began seeing spots that distorted her vision. Immediate pain in the ears, which felt as is the ears were very swollen and inflamed. It was difficult to talk because talking caused pain in the ears. Severe headache. Obviously her anxiety level escalated.   We immediately found wet paper towels to place on her forehead and back of the neck to cool her. I found a hair tie and tied her hair up off her neck to keep her as cool as possible. She was sweating so much she soaked her t-shirt and was pouring sweat down her face, neck and body. We also moved patient from the chair, and placed her on the floor of the pharmacy, leaning against the wall with her legs stretched out.  As a type 1 diabetic, the obvious concern was blood sugar during this reaction. Patient wears an insulin pump and Dexcom continuous glucose monitor. I was able to read her blood sugar levels during all the reaction time. Her blood sugar level spiked up. It then began to drop after a few minutes. I had an apple juice, and gave her the 15 carb apple juice.

The mom made a comment that her daughter has a tendency to pass out after vaccines after administering the vaccine to the patient.  We kept the patient in the counseling room seated for observation to be on the safe side.  Within 5 minutes, the patient got light headed and stated she didn&#39;t fell well.  She passed out.  We laid her down for about 10-15 minutes and gave her some candy since she stated she hadn&#39;t eaten all day.   Pt regained consciousness and was fine after.

I don?t believe she hit her head we didn?t see a lump. She came too right away and got nauseated and light-headed again sitting up so we took her to lay down on the stretcher. She was doing ok but laying down when I left.   The nurse that administered the immunization wrote: She got vaccinated, tolerated it well. Told her sister she barely felt it and expressed relief. Sat for a minute while in handed her mom paperwork ( vaccination card). Then got up, stood with mom and brother. Was standing one minute and went down without warning, standing next to brother and mom. I had just finished vaccinating the sister, I was putting a bandaid on her when it happened so couldn&#39;t have been more than a couple of minutes.   Dr.  observed this patient after they passed out at the vaccination clinic and subsequently released her home with the family.

It only lasted a few minutes, and then I was perfectly fine. It came on very suddenly and didn?t last long, but it was extreme during those few minutes. It was also very hot that day. And I had a mild migraine headache in the morning, but that wasn?t very bad, and I get migraines fairly regularly.

We have had to continue alternating tylenol and advil since Saturday and she is unable to stand or walk for prolonged periods.

Approximately 3 minutes after shot was given I was called out to the waiting room as the patient had passed out. I helped her mother lower her to the floor and by the time we lowered her down she was regaining consciousness.

                                                Prior to arrival, the patient received her first COVID vaccine at the clinic, after which she suddenly felt dizzy, described as lightheadedness, and felt warm. She was noted to be hypotensive with SBP at 67. She subsequently drank water with some improvement. No syncope, severe headache, numbness, tingling sensations, or focal weakness. Mother was concerned and brought the child to the ED for further evaluation. Currently the patient feels better. No similar symptoms in the past. The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. No recent fever or cough.She is otherwise healthy and has a normal cardiopulmonary exam and reassuring EKG.  The description of her symptoms and the environment which happened is very consistent with vasovagal syncope and she does not have any stigmata, and acute neurologic or cardiac emergency.  I believe she is safe and stable for discharge home and she was discharged with return precautions and follow-up instructions.

We checked her in and (pharmacist ) gave her shot with her mom present at 2 10pm and she was fine with no issues. Within 2 minutes in of her observation period, she started fainting and having seizure like for about 10 seconds, and regained conscious and said she felt dizzy and then blacked out. She was pale and sweating and asked for water. Our shift lead happened to be closed by her chair where she was sitting so she prevented pt from falling down from the chair and called pharmacist for help from inside the pharmacy. Pharmacist rushed to the patient and asked shift lead to call 911. Pt was consious, but lethargic, she could breath normally, no sign of obtruction airway. Pharmacist lift her legs up to opposite chair and started to take BP. Paramedic arrived within minutes and took her vitals which was normal. Mom agreed for paramedic took her out in stretcher to hospital for check up.

Mom was with her--patient was coherent and speaking to me.  She said her head hurt--I told her I&#39;d get an ice pack, which I did and gave to her.  Mom was really worried so I asked her if she wanted me to call 911, which I did.  2 EMTs came and checked the patient out.  Mom wanted her to go get checked out at the hospital so the patient and Mom went with the EMTs.  I called Mom around 8:00pm 5/28/2021 and she said pt was checked out.  The hospital doctor said it was a vaso-vagal reaction and released patient home with no restrictions.

Once the patient regained consciousness, the patient was nauseated and vomited.  Minutes later she had another seizure but immediately came out of it.  We asked the patient if this happen to her during the first dose and she said it did not.  The patient does not have a history of epilepsy.  The patient&#39;s mother did say she had the exact same reaction when she had braces put on.  The patient sat in the waiting room for 30 minutes while drinking water.  Before the patient left, we had check up on her and she said she felt completely fine.  I (the pharmacist) called the mother a couple of hours later to check up on the patient.  The mother said she felt fine as if nothing ever happened.  I did recommend to her that her daughter  gets checked up at urgent care today just to be on the safe side.  The mother said she has an appointment with her primary care next week.

It was also found that Bipasha had high BP 149/61. The drs could not make out what happened and they discharged her later on after giving some IV fluids and some pain medicine.  On 5/31 and 6/1, at home, patient was seemingly okay.  On 6/2, Wednesday, patient developed headache again, same symptoms like on 5/30. We rushed her to Urgent care in Fremont and saw her pediatrician dr and a pediatric neurologist. Her BP was high then also 144/87. No cause could be found why. The pediatric neurologist was suggesting it is possible that some Inflammation could be causing the blood fluctuations. Orthostatic testing resulted in major fluctuations of BP.  Both neurologist and neurosurgeon have ruled out hydrocephalus. They are saying heart inflammation could be a cause.

The following week she had a very heavy period that lasted longer than usual with severe cramps and occasional lightheaded/dizzy spells. After her cycle ended, she continued having  brief episodes of dizziness, usually when going from sitting to standing, usually resolved quickly (after a few minutes) with rest. Over the past two weeks, the episodes have become more frequent and intense, and over the past few days episodes also include s/s of seeing spots and having blurred vision with nausea, SOB, and palpitations/tachycardia. Tonight while at lacrosse practice, pt suddenly became dizzy and felt like she might pass out, became diaphoretic and pale.

                                                My daughter received her second Pfizer vaccinations at 2:15 pm.  At 1230 at night she work up with stabbing chest pain in the center of her chest that lasted three hours.  She initially said her felt faint and couldn?t catch her breath as well as initial nausea.  Being an advanced healthcare professional, I spent five minutes of asking her questions:  did she eat something bad, did she feel like she needed and inhaler, did she need to use the restroom, checked her pulse (100bpm with palpitations), no resolve.  We live 5 minutes from hospital where we prefer to go, but my daughter didn?t think she could make the five minute ride there.  We went to ER that is around the block from us  and it was total chaos.  40 &#43; people in the waiting room to be seen. My daughter was visibly in distress, crying and couldn?t keep still because of the intense chest pain she rated a 10 out of 10.  Finally they did a 12 lead EKG.  The rolled us to the back of the waiting room.  After 15 minutes, I rolled back out to the front desk and no attention to her and her severe chest pain.  Finally I announced we were going to hospital.  The called back to us? ?Good Luck!? Got pt to hospital and the  immediately did EKG, lab work, chest x ray, urinalysis. The  chest pain became intermittent then final subsided.  The doctors ruled out pneumonia, No PE, EKG WNL, lab work fine.  The Doctor stated it was chest wall pain and gave us a NSAID prescription. I talked to my sister who is an nurse works in the vaccination clinics.  She said she has  had patients who have had bouts of pericarditis and pleurisy after the second shot.  That motivated me to google second dose Pfizer reaction in teens.  There is a rare side effect of myocarditis in the teen population after the second dose.  The publication date was June 4  the day before my daughters reaction.  I didn?t thinsk the ER physician was aware of the the possible rare side effect of myocarditis in teens.  I was happy with the care we did receive.

Patients head rolled side to side and patients mom started freaking out thinking she was having a seizure. She screamed at the technician who administered the vaccine to call 911 .  Patient regained consciousness after 10 seconds and was fully alert and able to speak/ answer questions. Pt maintained consciousness the whole time while waiting for the ambulance.  Pt&#39;s mom still wanted an ambulance so one was called and EMT&#39;s came and accessed the patients vitals. Vitals were all within normal limits and EMTs spoke with mom and advised that pt most likely did not have a seizure and gave the option to transport to the hospital or monitor at home. Mom chose to monitor at home and pt was able to walk out of the store on her own.

                                                After recieving IMZ pt felt a bit dizzy. I had pt stay in the IMZ chair until she said she felt better at which point she went to the post IMZ waiting area. On the way to the area, she got dizzy again and her legs gave out and her mom was holding her up. As I came out to get her, pt was awake and responsive. Unsure if she ever actually passed out or if she was just light headed. Laid pt on the floor with feet elevated for a few minutes with a cold compress on forehead. After a few minutes, pt felt better so had her sit up still on the floor with cold compress. After a few more minutes, pt felt better and had her sit in chair and finish post IMZ wait time. Pt felt fine and left.

                                                Technician (licensed to vaccinate) administered vaccine to patient near pharmacist.  20 seconds or so after administration, patient stated felt dizzy and immediately became unresponsive and head dropped to chest.  Technician stated he then lifted the patients head because he heard a &#34;snoring&#34; sound indicating airway may be constricted due to positioning.  Technician stated the patient&#39;s body twitched and became ridged, throwing her belongings. He called pharmacist (myself) for assistance. I immediately checked for breathing and pulse, both of which were evident.  I observed pt vitals for about 20 seconds before the pt opened her eyes and was responsive and able to talk to me.  Blood pressure was 120/69.  Pt remained in the pharmacy waiting area for 30 minutes after.  Patient said that in the past she has nearly passed out from piercings she has had, but has never fainted before and has no history of seizures.

                                                Dizziness/lightheadedness; Nausea; Blurred vision; Terrible headache; a little palpitation; Clogged throat; this heaviness (not clarified); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (parent). A 15-years-old non pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15May2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0182) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included no other illness. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously received Amoxicillin, Azithromicin, Cefdinir, Gardasil(Pf) and had allergy. The patient had Nausea that does not go away with Gardasil. She also received HPV vaccine previously and experienced nausea and the dizziness for a month. Reporter stated, &#34;she did not have any allergic &#39;condition&#39; (not clear) but she was allergic, she had always had a rash when she had this Amoxicillin this antibiotic. She was allergic to Penicillin.&#34; The patient had the COVID Pfizer Vaccine on 15May2021 and as soon as she had her first dose she started to feel nausea and dizziness and from there 5 days later she had, she felt a terrible headache, &#39;this heaviness&#39; (not clarified), headache, dizziness, palpitation. The reporter took her to the emergency room, they did all the test and they didn&#39;t really see anything in the results. From there she cannot stop to have nausea and dizziness and clogged throat so the reporter had to give allergy medication to her every day. She did have, she never had an allergic reaction to any vaccine but the HPV vaccine (captured as unspecified vaccine in tab) what was similar to what she is experiencing now. She had nausea and the dizziness for a month that she couldn&#39;t stay in school and she has this nausea and dizziness and clogged throat she has to run for this allergy medication what normally she never needed. So, she doesn&#39;t want to take this second dose and the reporter was wondering if it is Pfizer because she was just like (Height), a (Weight) pounds if because the reporter understand the vaccine is one for everybody, isn&#39;t this strong for a kid with that height that weight, that you do not needed the second dose. The patient could not she said she will not because she goes to school and she feel the nausea and dizziness and so. The reporter would like to report it because it maybe Pfizer&#39;s that she was thinking that 1 dose would be enough for kids. When asked about the start of experiencing adverse events, the reported stated that &#34;Well the nausea and dizziness, she was a little bit not sure about like headache right after like her we stayed there like half hours because the doctor said to stay there because she has her reaction to which but then we just the reporter felt the nausea and everything was so bright you know, the reporter had the same effect but her went away and the patient after we received she was, the whole day but not too bad, 5 days after then she but she was already with this nausea, dizziness and 5 days after she got the palpitation, bad headache, nausea, dizziness and then I took her to the emergency room.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;No they have improved, the only thing now left is every day she has this nausea, dizziness and then she said about dizziness and then nausea and then clogged throat and then the reporter gave her the &#39;allergic pill I gave that, to this allergy&#39; (not clarified further) really she gave only 1 tablet a day.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;On 20May2021, they did a blood test, they did urine test, they did a ECG, so the hospital did all and the doctor too, nothing new.&#34; The reporter had lab test result on chart, she stated they put on her chart but she also had the copy of the results. Okay, here they put the result is a line on the chart. Okay here they put like linear line lab test complete, she get all the line because here they didn&#39;t put results but screen for metabolic and kidney disorder they did, they did an &#39;urinary tract infection&#39; (not clarified) they have marked in the ECG. Okay you going to ask for specific (incomplete sentence).&#34; The patient had no other illness but reporter need to know what Gardasil and Covid 19 vaccine have in common because the symptoms were very similar. Nausea that does not go away. She asked if it is the preservative or what ingredients. Never had a reaction to any other vaccine. She just wanted to call the Medical Department if she should have the vaccine on Saturday or not.

                                                Upon leaving the store approximately 15 minutes after receiving vaccination, patient told her father that she felt she was having an issue with her vision and was feeling faint.  Her father was able to support her as she fainted and was lowered gently to the ground in front of the store.  A pharmacy technician was leaving the store simultaneously and upon witnessing the event ran back to the pharmacy to tell me I was needed to assist.  When I arrived, the patient was alert and breathing and able to answer questions regarding personal information, date, time and location.  Patient stated she felt normal other than some tingling sensation in her hands.  Patient reported that she hadn&#39;t eaten anything since waking up that morning.  EMS was already en route, and I observed the patient until they arrived.  Patient has since been transported to the hospital and is currently reported in stable condition.

                                                Patient complained of pain in left arm (injection arm) and dizziness.  I monitored patient for anaphylaxis.  Patient showed no signs of anaphylaxis. I took her blood pressure and temperature.  BP was 75/35, heart rate = 68 and temperature 98.7.  I monitored patient for 30 minutes. After sipping on orange juice, she started to feel better.  Her mother was present.  I asked her mother who the child&#39;s doctor is and she stated that daughter has no doctor.  I recommended that her doctor be seen today to monitor.

                                                Client received dose 1 of the COVID19 Pfizer vaccine (Lot# EW0187 Exp 08/31/21) at 13:32 from RN1.  RN1 reported that within 5 seconds of receiving the vaccine, the client reported she felt dizzy and experienced a syncopal episode for 2-3 seconds.  As the syncopal episode was occurring, ancillary staff, requested RN2 radio for a Lead Nurse &amp; EMT.  At 13:34 Lead RN arrived at station 6, radioed for an EMT, and observed client sitting up in the vaccination chair being held by her mother and RN1.  Lead RN noted client?s head was down with her eyes open, exhibiting pallor and was diaphoretic.  Lead RN asked client her name and how she was feeling.  Client did not respond.  Co-Lead RN entered the room at 13:35. RN1, Lead RN, Co-Lead RN, and client?s mother guided client to the floor, laid her in a supine position, lifting her legs and feet on a chair.  Co-Lead RN removed client?s mask, continued to ask client her name.  Within 2-3 seconds of repositioning client, she became responsive and alert &amp; oriented to person, place, time, and event.  Client also immediately stated, ?I?m fine.?  EMT1, EMT2, and EMT3 came to the station at 13:36 with a zero-gravity chair.  The EMTs assisted client into the zero-gravity chair.  Client?s mother stated client has no underlying health conditions, no allergies, and that birth control is the only medication the client takes.  The client confirmed this by nodding her head in agreeance.  EMT2 gave client a bottle of water and the client immediately started drinking the water.  Lead RN asked client if she had eaten or drank anything today.  Client?s mother stated she did not realize her daughter had not eaten or drank anything prior to coming to get vaccinated.  Client stated she was given a granola bar downstairs at check-in and ate it before receiving the vaccine.  At 13:45 EMT1 took vitals.  Both EMT1 &amp; EMT2 were unable to obtain client?s blood pressure (HR:61, O2Sat:  97%).  Lead RN asked client and her mother what the client?s normal blood pressure is.  Client and her mother did not know, and client?s mother indicated that the client is an athlete in good shape.  At 13:48, EMT3 took client?s blood pressure, which was 100/60.  Client?s mother stated client was anxious about being vaccinated and has fainted when anxious in the past, but the last time was around 5 years ago.  Client stated she was feeling better and no longer feeling dizzy.  Client stated she just ?feels hot.?  Lead RN brought client an ice pack to put behind her neck and damp paper towels to wipe her face with.  At 13:59 EMT3 took client?s vitals (BP:  118/70, HR: 65, O2Sat 98%).  Lead RN observed that client?s color was returning to her face and client was less diaphoretic.  Client finished her bottled water and was given another by EMT2, which she started drinking.  Lead RN asked client if she felt she could stand up.  Client stood up and stated she was ?feeling fine.?  At 14:05 all 3 EMTs escorted client and her mother to the observation room where she was monitored for an additional 30 minutes.  At 14:30 Lead RN went to the observation room where EMT1was taking client?s vitals (BP:  110/70, HR: 60, SPO2 Sat 98%).  Lead RN observed that client?s color had fully returned, and client was no longer diaphoretic.  Client stated she ?felt fine? and was hungry.  Client?s mother stated she would take client to get something to eat and EMT2 gave client an additional snack that client took with her when she left.  Client and her mother left at 14:30. Client was walking with a steady gait when she exited the building.

                                                We administered dose 1 of  Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine to the patient without incident at administration.  She was asked to wait for 15 minutes in our waiting area and about 10 minutes after her vaccine, I noticed her slumping in her chair and ran over to her.  We called an ambulance, helped her to the floor, and checked her pulse. We were able to feel her pulse, but she did seem to faint for a few seconds. She then remained responsive, answered our questions, and squeezed our hands when we asked.  We did not administer any rescue medications. The ambulance arrived and they did transport her to the ER.

I noticed her eyes were now open but she was pale and listless. I called to a tech to call 911. I asked her if she could speak and she nodded. I asked if she had eaten and she shook her head no and her mother said she had not.

                                                They said it was an ovarian cyst rupture; Around 8 pm she started screaming in pain; feeling nauseous; feeling nauseous and dizzy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 15-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Jun2021 12:00 at age of 15 years old (Batch/Lot Number: EW0196) as Dose 2, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Administered is Pharmacy or Drug Store. Medical history included asthma and no known allergies. Historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 30May2021 11:00 at age of 15 years old (Batch/Lot Number: EW0196) as Dose 1, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. After her 1st covid shot on 30May2021 and then had her period on 02Jun2021. It was 4 days early and was the worse period she has experienced in 3 years. She was bleeding excessively and extreme cramps. It maybe a coincidence. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medication(s) included paracetamol (TYLENOL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  After her 2nd covid shot on 20Jun2021 around 12 noon. Around 8 pm she started screaming in pain, hunched over, feeling nauseous and dizzy. Patient had clinic visit, ended up taking to ER where they gave her morphine for pain. They started IV, did bloodwork, ultrasound and ct scan with contrast all on 20Jun2021. They said it was an ovarian cyst rupture. Patient was only 15 years old and has had her period for 3 years and has never experienced anything like what she has in the last month. She is due for her next period on 29Jun21 and pray it&#39;s not as bad as last month after the shot. They do believe in science, but also think should study menstrual cycles with this shot. They pray this was just a fluke, but patient has never experienced pain or severe periods like this until shot. Treatment received for all events. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested

She stated she felt dizzy before she passed out. Once she was able to sit up we applied ice to her head due to a lump from hitting her head and only two minor scratches on her scalp that we cleaned well. We gave her something to eat and drink when she was able to sit up and we knew she was alert  enough to eat. She began to feel better after this.

She did not lose consciousness at any point but was very clammy, sweaty and lethargic and feeling very weak and faint. We called 911 right away and EMS came and took her vitals which they reported as normal but took her to the ER to be evaluated.  After speaking with mother that evening and the next day she reported it took her &#34; a while&#34; to feel better at the ER and the ER noted her blood sugar was also low.  They ran some other tests but nothing else was remarkable according to mother. By the next day when we spoke 7/11 patient was feeling much better and back to normal according to mother.

                                                Around 9 AM, my daughter came downstairs and said her legs felt heavy. She sat down and then she said she was really hot. She was also sweating and pale. She said that she felt like she was about to pass out and that she couldn&#39;t see. She also said she couldn&#39;t focus, that she was seeing stars, and everything looked black. My husband and I told her to lay down on the couch. We gave her a rag to put on her head to cool her down and we got her some water to drink. She said she had a headache and we gave her some Tylenol.
