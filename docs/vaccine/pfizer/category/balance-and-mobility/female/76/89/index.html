Tues 1/26/2021 I contacted my Doctor and told him my story.   1/27/2021 I developed a rash across my nose and cheeks which is today.

Today I am shaky, my stomach is bothering me, I can walk today but I real tired and shaky and have to come right back to my chair to sit down.  I am better then I was yesterday.  If I don&#39;t feel better by noon I will call my doctor.

Put on more clothes and sat by fireplace.  Took 2 Tyneol and ate banana.  Continued to shake all over for 10 mins.  Shaking so much could not hold phone.  Subsided.  Startrd again lasting for 10 mins.  Subsided and finished at 11:30  PM.  Stayed up until 1;00 PM.  To bed and had difficulty sleeping.  Feel alright today.

Medical history included being diabetic, glaucoma. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated that she had the vaccine on Tuesday (19Jan2021) she was reading over the &#39;notary&#39; the side effects to be expected and that list one here it say, it could be an allergic reaction but it says that would happen after few hours after the injection but she got it on Tuesday, yesterday (20Jan2021) she was fine. On 21Jan2021, she had been really nauseous and dizzy most of the day, patient wondered whether that was something that she should expect you know would happen because the list here says dizziness and weakness is one of the side effects so is that just something that last for a while and then go away or she should be concerned about.  09Feb2021 is the date that would be for her second shot.  Outcome of the events was unknown.

When I got to my doctor my blood pressure was elevated, it was about 180/88. My blood pressure is never that high. It did go down before I left to 140/84. When we were walking in the elevator after leaving the appointment my gait was unsteady. I felt very weak. I also light headed, and dizzy.  It felt like the feeling of the sedation you have receive  before having surgery. When we made it home I couldn&#39;t even see straight.  This lasted about 2 hours. I feel much better today.

I went to bed around 11:30 and didn&#39;t sleep very well.  On Wed. am after going to the bathroom, I felt woozy while washing my hands.  When I thought I felt better, I made my way back to the bedroom and passed out.  I fell on my right side, bruising the right side of my face, my right hip and my right thigh.  I apparently had my left hand under me when I fell because I broke the knuckle under the pinkie of my left hand.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, diabetic, stage 3 kidney disease, known allergies to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that patient got the shot on Thursday morning (04Feb2021) and later that evening reported as at 10:00pm, the patient developed a nose bleed that would not stop. By 10:30pm  she passed out/fell, site car management was called and she was sent to the ER where she stayed for evaluations for 2 days. The reporter does not think the Covid shot was connected to the event. No treatment was given to the patient. The patient had no covid prior to  vaccination and was not tested for covid post vaccination. The patient was recovering from the events at the time of the report.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Within 2 hours after the second shot, I became foggy brained.  I was not able to think properly or at times u was not sure where I was and what i was  doing.  I was also very unstable in walking.

                                                Within 8 hours of the vaccine, I experienced severe muscle weakness (could not lift arms above head; could not stand from sitting position without pain). During night, could not turn over in bed without pain. This lasted for 3-4 days. Treated with Advil. Next symptoms were joint pains and stiffness and back pains, which also lasted about a week. Treated with Aleve and hot/cold compresses. Final symptoms are severe swelling and stiffness of hands and fingers, with cracked, peeling skin. I have had this for about a week now and it is not improving. Cannot grasp anything with either hand. Middle and index fingers on both hands useless.

Her right arm is okay and she&#39;s had not trouble speaking or had a facial droop. She is taking the prednisone which was prescribed.   She started using a cane on 3/10/2021 due to dysequilibrium with veering towards the right. She felt more stable this morning but this afternoon is again needing to use the cane.

When I got up to take a Motrin I was disorientated. Did not know where I was. .   Next day experienced several sudden feelings a syncopye.  Lasting a few seconds. Had to grab on to something due to a feeling that I was going to fall. It lasted just a quick second or two.  Happened several times that day.  Like what I would think a TIA would feel like.  Arm was just slightly tender and stinging the first day,.  In the night it was aching and hot up into my neck.  The next morning it was fine again. Just tender and a little stiff.  I attempted to report this on line at instructed on forms given me when I left the site. however the CODE that was to be sent to my phone never came. I then entered the wed site and attempted to report it there. .  Finally I called my primary Dr and he has instructed me to report this to the person giving the second injection.  I doubt they will know what to do seeing as they are volunteers with little experienc.e

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

Got up about 2AM to go to the bathroom; started back to bed; had a bad taste in mouth, so decided to brush my teeth.  Started brushing and all of a sudden, felt faint; before I could get the toothbrush back, I fell and my husband rushed over. Said I was out completely; got me awake and back up and went to bed and slept. until 11am.   At 3pm when taking a shower, noticed my left shoulder blade was real sore and looked and there were 3 red strips below should blade - no bleeding tho.  top R. side of head kinda sore, so must have hit when falling. Went back to bed and slept good.  Didn&#39;t need to go to the Dr. and am feeling good now.  Just rested for a couple days.  Had been feeling really good and don&#39;t take any prescriptions, so could only think it had to have something to do with the shot. Today is the 4th day and feel good.

A 76-year-old female patient received  the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9266, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 23Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history included stomach problem and bleeding problems in her stomach. There were no concomitant medications. The patient said that absolutely everything was okay until she went to get the shot, and was even okay the evening of the shot, then it went down hill from there. She said nothing she has that is related to the pain in her arm, or that she feels she should provide. She did not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient stated that the injection area was a little sore and the area became bigger and bigger by Wednesday (24Feb2021). She woke up on Thursday (25Feb2021) and her elbow and shoulder was in pain, described as a dull pain. The patient stated she has a stomach problem where she can&#39;t take medicine. She started treating her pain with aspirin cream with Lidocaine. She said that its kind of worked, it didn&#39;t take it away, but more manageable. Now it&#39;s been 6 days later (01Mar2021), it was reported a deep deep pain in the point she can&#39;t sleep at night. She can&#39;t position her arm in a way that is not painful. It was getting unbearable. It transferred from shoulder to her neck on Friday (26Feb2021). It got worse Thursday evening and has been the same since. Patient said, &#34;I am not going to get the second shot if this pain does not go away or if I am going to experience this again.&#34; The patient was calling about a possible side effect and was wondering if anyone else had it and does it go away. She was suffering, she wanted to know if the pain she is in, that she is still experiencing will go away. She said that she had a deep muscle ache pain to the point she can&#39;t sleep at night.  Patient stated that her pain began as soreness at injection site that started Wednesday and then it just got worse and worse and became deeper and deeper just between her shoulder and elbow, a deep constant achy pain. During the day when she is using her arm she can kind of forget the pain, but at night there was no comfortable position she can put her arm in without pain, so she has not been sleeping the last 3-4 nights, she can&#39;t sleep, she was miserable. She said she would rather get COVID than this, it was ridiculous. As she has bleeding problems in her stomach, she can&#39;t take anything to treat the pain, so she was trying to use lidocaine on her arm, which did at first give some relief but no longer works. She said that the only number listed on the bottle was next to &#34;EXP date, LOT: 19C506, EXP: Mar2021 (as reported).&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8730) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 10:30 (at the age of 76-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.

She felt her symptoms went in different degrees at different times of the day. She might go one day without a headache. Today her headache was more like a numbness all around her head. She stated that her headaches come and go, sometimes start when her eyes pop open in the morning or at 10 AM. If she was going to have a headache that day, it usually started by 10 AM and was a full-blown headache. Stated her head always fely fuzzy and woozy and sometimes she felt like her eyes were crossing. She stated that she never got headaches; not since her early 20s. Dizziness continued to come and go, but it affected her vision and she was scared to drive and have a wreck. She reported that the symptoms were driving her bonkers. She also reported that she had to hold onto walls when she walked. The dizziness did not go away even when she laid down. She was dizzy when sitting on the sofa.

She cannot lay in bed all the time and wanted to know how long these symptoms would last. The patient denied any labs, testing or treatment relevant to symptoms. She had not been to the doctor or to the emergency room in relation to these symptoms. She stated that she thought about it at times. She stated that she would have to call an ambulance to take her since she was scared to drive. Yesterday she thought she was not doing so bad and drove to the store. She stated that while in the store, her dizziness had her to where she could hardly pay for her items. Stated that it kind of felt like she was drunk, but she was not drunk. The patient stated that her experience with the polio vaccine made her almost not get the COVID-19 vaccine for fear it would bring on a similar situation. The clinical outcomes of the events headaches, dizziness, dizziness comes and goes but it affects her vision, numb, head feels fuzzy/fuzziness is constant and eyes are crossing were all not recovered/not resolved. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                She got her vaccine, started with a headache, severe and then it went to chills, then started with a low grade fever of 99.1.  She was cold, shaking, then was tired, joint and muscles aching, and not wanting to move, just wanting to sleep.  No appetite.  She took a baby aspirin, the headache subsided but returned when the aspirin wore off.  She was out of it from Saturday to Sunday morning.  The headache was so severe and she took some Tylenol.  During the night she sweated so much that everything was drenched.  She had to get up and change her clothes again as she was wet from the chills, and urinating a lot possibly due to the water intake.  She feels much better than she did yesterday and Saturday but still having headaches, and not wanting the 2nd vaccine.    She did have COVID in July of 2020 and hospitalized 3 times during that time-frame.  She does not want to experience the same reaction.   She has an APT with her PCP coming up in May.   She was also diagnosed with the regular flu in  January and feels that she has the same symptoms if not worse than what she had experienced in the past.   She did have dizziness a lot and  had to use her walker to steady herself first.

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021) via unknown route of administration in right upper arm on 21Jan2021 at 11:00, at a dose of 0.3mL as a single dose for Covid-19 immunization in Hospital and received new refill of Mycophenolate mofetil, which is an immunosuppressant at a dose of 250mg, 2 capsules by mouth two times daily for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on the same day (21Jan2021). Medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity), kidney problem and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 30Jan2021, the patient experienced the dizziness, that started 10 days after the first dose of the vaccine and on the new refill of Mycophenolate mofetil and patient felt weird when she went for walk. On 01Feb2021, the patient was not feeling that great. Last Saturday (30Jan2021) and again today she felt some dizziness, felt weird, but did not think it can be blamed on the vaccine, or did that happen. She enquired whether that could also interact with the vaccine and had zero reactions until last Saturday. So, she wanted to check with Pfizer first and then with her kidney doctor. At that time, she was dizzy and could not shake it all that morning lone. Patient was on Mycophenolate mofetil for 2-3 years and it was a refill she just started on. With the timing right then with the dizziness wonders if related to the new batch she started that day. Unable to provide the NDC, Lot, or expiry for the Mycophenolate mofetil, but provided a discard date of 19Jan2022 from the white manufacture bottle and mentions (name) label over bottle. Mentioned that she does not take product as read on bottle it has been changed after discussion with the provider. Was using this prescription 2 in the morning and 1 at night and since she has been having the dizziness, she has switched to taking it 1 in the morning and 2 at night. Did read on the instructions that this can cause dizziness, but she had taken this stuff for over 3 years and was trying to figure out if it&#39;s a bad batch or not. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced headache and thinks she was shrunk and may have gained some weight. The outcome for the events dizziness, felt weird when went for walk, not feeling that great was not recovered and for headache, was shrunk and may have gained some weight was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EW0158) via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder (Deltoid Right) on 11Apr2021 in the afternoon around 14:00 or 14:30 (at 76-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. None history of all previous immunization with BNT162B2 considered as suspect. Concomitant medication included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) for sinus disorder for years as needed. She took it the day before the COVID19 injection. She hasn&#39;t taken it since before getting COVID19 injection. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She didn&#39;t have the ones on the paper. They didn&#39;t say she would have severe throwing up she almost had to call. She was choking on 12Apr2021. She was over it currently. She first threw up on Sunday evening and then was ok. On Sunday (11Apr2021 21:00) she only threw up once, but it was four intervals. Caller clarified an interval was where she would throw up then clean up and then throw up again. Then it was fine. On Monday (12Apr2021), in the evening around 9 PM she started to spin. She went to the bathroom and she was heaving and she couldn&#39;t say how many times she threw up. Her throat was so swollen and it felt like she was choking. Her throat was very raw. Her uvula was so swollen that is why she felt like she was choking. She was about to go the emergency room, but then looked it up. She did treatment that she saw online for 3 days. When she was gagging and coughing she looked up COVID19 Vaccine and it said that her throat would be swollen from severe throwing up. It made a lot of sense. She had all the symptoms listed online and it said it would get better in five days and if not seek treatment. It has gotten better. No visit for ER and Physician Office. Treatment received for all events. The outcomes of the events were resolving.

My last check in report I would like to change my health status to serious vertigo experience beginning on May 1, 2021.  In the middle of the night while in bed I felt like I was falling.  The next day I had the need to fall to the left side all the way to the floor 2 times safety and felt very dizzy for the 2 days.  I began my balance exercises.  I continue to have frequent serious dizziness episodes since May 1.  Can this recent on set of strong vertigo be a result of the vaccine?  Until now all vertigo expressions were mild.

The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ongoing levothyroxine started 40 years before some form of it for thyroid, morniflumate(FLOMAX) been on a couple of years for bone density. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2(Lot number: EL9262) on 22Jan2021 (in the morning, 10:30 or somewhere around that) at the age of 76-year-old, at left arm for covid-19 immunisation. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) reported as none. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect reported as none. The patient wanted to report adverse side effect for vaccine. She got Pfizer Covid Vaccine. First shot she did just fine. With the second shot, her body had reaction to the vaccine and she ended up in the hospital. It happened on a Friday and she couldn&#39;t get to her doctor. She went to the ER and was diagnosed with ADEM. Later in the call she clarified that ADEM was acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. She went to the doctor on a Monday and ended up in the hospital. There was a week in between. She got her shot on a Friday. She went away to a cabin during the weekend. She felt that something was not right during the week. She called her doctor the following Friday, but could not get in until the following Monday. She thought she was getting better. She said slowly she was but when she looked up Pfizer online, it said all about reporting side effects. When the patient was asked if she knew what ADEM meant, she said it was acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. It was 15Feb2021 or 16Feb2021 when the symptoms started. In Feb2021, she still couldn&#39;t walk right. She had balance issues. She couldn&#39;t control. Sometimes she couldn&#39;t control her bladder. She thought she had got to follow up on all of this. She thought it would go away. The ADEM improved somewhat. She thought if she gave it enough time, it would go away. It had been 4 months and she still could not walk right. It started mid February when she was put in the hospital. It had improved somewhat. The patient finally decided that she couldn&#39;t take the bladder control issue anymore. She had an appointment with a urologist. The balance issues were part of not being able to walk right. She was admitted to the hospital. She was in the hospital for 4 days. She went 22Feb2021 and came home on 26Feb2021. Treatment for events included steroid infusion IV in the hospital. When she came home from the hospital, they had her on steroids for about a month. She also did physical therapy. While she was in the hospital, she did lab work, a spinal tap and a MRI. She had a whole battery of tests done at the hospital. She did not know the dates or results of the tests. Events required a visit to emergency room and physician office. Events were serious as hospitalization from 22Feb2021 to 26Feb2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

I had left the site after the 15 minute wait,  and since I read that Nausea was one of the side effects, I thought it would go away.  I waited another  30 minutes in my car at a parking lot outside the hospital in case I really  couldn&#39;t drive home.  I did drive home , but have been feeling the same nausea every day and some dizziness and diarrhea for the past 11 days.  I called my doctor and she said to take it easy, drink fluids, eat light and that I could get the second shot. I am not sure if this is just a reaction or a severe allergic reaction and I need advice and feedback on that issue.

Second day, Soar Throat when swallowing, Swollen Eyes in the morning when I woke up, increased blood pressure at times and not as stable when walking.  Very Tired.

Left Arm also less soar today and stability when walking seems better...

                                                After first shot, I noticed stiffness and soreness in right knee but attributed it to a misstep in snow.  It was annoying but not limiting; however, muscle soreness I attributed to a wrenched knee did not abate.    At this point, I consulted my Primary Care Physican&#39;s office, and I also had an X-ray of my knee.  It showed an aging kneecap, but I continued to report pain as muscular and on the side of my knee.   An appt with local orthopedic center was suggested by PCP office and was scheduled.  This was the day before my second shot.          After my second shot, the pain and difficulty walking increased 100-fold.  Orthopedist suggested PT for next 6 weeks, which I will do.  Taking Tylenol and Ibuprofin, applying heat and cold, using some topical pain relievers; but for the most part, I am just not able to walk far, if at all.  I run a business from my home, so I get around by &#34;riding&#34; my rolling office chair everywhere in my (fortunately) small home.   If I can get to the car, I can drive without difficulty.             I am a busy, active, independent person.  Having experienced the polio epidemic in the &#39;50&#39;s, I get all my vaccines; I am not anti-vaccines.  I do feel the fact that my disability happened the same month as the vaccine is significant, and I wanted you to know my symptoms and situation.

Could not warm up, had two down comforters on. The chills eventually stopped but the headaches Intensified, also I could. Or move my near and shoulders. Went to the ER, they did not believe it had anything to do with the shot, I was there for 12 hours, had head exrays, spinal taps to test for meningitis, they searched for anything else I might have...nothing else.. they would not say if I should have the second shot, called pfiser this morning, they could not tell me if I should have the second shot, that I should aske my doctor.......If Pfiser  doctor  does not know if it is safe how could  my country doctor.

                                                The shot was given in my left shoulder.   Two days later the left shoulder blade became rather painful, making movement difficult.   E.g. turning my head to the left was very uncomfortable.   These symptoms lasted about two days -- by a week later they were gone   I used a hot pad and tylenol to become more comfortable.   Probably not a very significant issue, but it was uncomfortable,   I wondered if I perhaps had &#34;pulled a tendon&#34; or something like that.

She was very dizzy. She was light headed/ foggy headed. That passed until she went to sit up and get out of bed. It happened again. It has been happening on and off for the last 3 days. She has checked her blood pressure because she is on a low dose blood pressure medicine. Her blood pressure was okay. Everything else seems to be normal. She gets that dizziness for a very short period of time. Her head is not a headache. It is so hard to explain. It is like a floaty heady feeling. She did have a little achiness in her arm. When she puts her head down, it is like woah this is strange. Her head feels like it is swimming. It is mostly when she gets in and out of bed. When she lays her head down and picks her head up. She provided that her height as 5&#39;1&#34; to 5&#39;1.5&#34;.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had anaphylactic shock in the past to a sulfur antibiotic. There were no concomitant medications. She stated she did not have an extreme reaction for the first 3-4 days, it was fine and went away. She had fatigue, joint pain, all the regular things and they were easing up. She had an appointment on the 20Jan2021 and thought things were going okay. On day 7, 20Jan2021, that night, she had an extreme reaction of blinding headache, the shakes, her whole body was shaking out of control for hours, her neck froze completely, and she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal (this is still occurring). The patient has had joint paint on 14Jan2021; extreme tiredness, weakness and muscle pain on 15Jan2021; chills, pain in her neck and muscles were so sore from 20Jan2021. She figured that was side effects, and she was handling, and then exactly a week after, she got the shakes so bad she shook for like 5 hours, she had to put nightguard in her mouth to stop from cracking, and severe headaches and her neck completely locked up, she couldn&#39;t move her head, and she still can&#39;t. She had extreme headache, and she went to the ER on 26Jan2021, since she was in really bad shape, they wouldn&#39;t believe her that it was a COVID reaction, she was there for 12 hours, they did every test, she had spinal taps, she had a head X-ray, everything, as they said she had meningitis, but then ruled that out, they wouldn&#39;t believe she was having a reaction to the COVID shot, she can&#39;t move her head, her joints and that are ok otherwise, but she can&#39;t move her head, she has pain in her neck, and she is taking Excedrin for that. She stated her doctor told her to go ahead and take the second dose of the vaccine and just take Tylenol after. She stated Tylenol has no effect whatsoever. If she takes Excedrin the headache will go away and Tylenol won&#39;t budge it. She stated she is taking Excedrin regardless of what the doctor says. When asked for age of onset, states she was on Valium and she was not thinking straight, and asked her husband her age. She was not sure why it was given, now provides name as Diazepam 5mg. Muscle pain is fine now, it went away. She went to the doctor on 20Jan2021, as she had a regular appointment for bloodwork to be done, and said she felt pretty good, she had some reaction but was fine, and that night is when she got shakes and shivers so bad, she had 3 quilts on and couldn&#39;t warm up, her body was out of control, she couldn&#39;t stop, now states for 3-4 hours. Severe headaches started the night of the 20Jan2021. Her neck pain started right after the shakes, so maybe she pulled muscles when she had the shakes, the muscles were so sore, and she couldn&#39;t move her head, like down or to the side, she couldn&#39;t move it, which is why she went to the hospital, to the ER. She was there for 12 hours. She started taking Excedrin, states she ignored what the doctor told her. She knows her body and she can take Tylenol and Ibuprofen like it is candy, and it does nothing, one Excedrin puts everything away, she swears by Excedrin. The outcome of the event shaking recovered on an unspecified date; Joint pain and Muscle pain recovered on 19Jan2021; Blinding headache/ severe headache, Fatigue/Extreme tiredness was recovering, chills/ shivers, couldn&#39;t warm up, Neck froze completely, pulled muscles, fatigue was unknown; she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal/ couldn&#39;t move her head, Pain in her neck, Muscles were so sore, Weakness was not recovered.

Went back to bed immediately. Became very chilled, and extremely tired. Checked temperature at 97.5 and was very cold. Fell asleep under warm down quilt until 2:00pm (total 13 hours sleep). Felt better, but ate little and wore a coat inside. After a light dinner, nausea mostly gone, but still tired. Reporter added that she almost certainly had a serious case of Covid in early February, 2020. Nobody knew the symptoms, so both urgent care and the ER sent her home with minimal treatment. She had severe breathing problems, no sense of taste or smell, severe bronchitis with some pneumonia (X-ray), and a productive cough that lasted for 2 months. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 97.5 (Unit unspecified) on 31Jan2021 and x-ray: some pneumonia on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the adverse event. It was unknown if the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.

Patient reported that she didn&#39;t feel good, felt like she was getting a migraine and after that she started getting dizzy and she thought she was going to help herself and lay down on the bed for about 45 minutes and then she got up after that and walked around on Jan2021. She felt like, she has never had a hangover but it felt like she had a hangover, that was what it felt like, and she thought she hopes that doesn&#39;t last and she got up Wednesday morning (Jan2021) and went to her podiatrist appointment. She didn&#39;t feel good but she was okay so she went to the podiatrist and then later she was fixing supper and she had some grease in a pan that she fried something in and she thought she wanted to get some water in it so she went to go with the pan and she got to the door and took 3 steps back and she thought good Lord, there is something is wrong here. She did empty the water and the grease and she thought well it is going to have to stay there, it was right at the back door so anyway. Her son came home from work and she got him get the blood pressure cuff and take her pressure and it was 158/98 and she thought, this was not good. She said she will just go lay down for a while and she went on to bed. The patient was taken into the hospital via an ambulance. She sat there until about 4-5 hours and later they got to take her blood pressure and result was 189/92 on Jan2021.

She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital it was an ER visit and they sent her home. She felt Thursday was not a good day she came down off of what had her up. She was going to say no to the second dose because she was sick on her stomach and drunk as a dog, she was really dizzy, very dizzy and she just had to sit down quiet her self. She was supposed to have surgery but because of COVID it has been cancelled 3 times. The outcome of the events were unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EM9801), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 04Feb2021 (Administered between 9:30-10:00AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date of vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced an atrial fibrillation in which she started racing and couldn&#39;t breathe. She mentioned that she recently attended a funeral but attributed the symptoms as side effects of the vaccine. She was taken to the Emergency room where she was given cortisone and resolved her symptoms. Patient also further  reported she had side effects with the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath. She said it was cold outside by her nephew&#39;s graveside, but she felt she had to fan herself like she was overheated. She said her heart rate was flying, and she had an irregular heart beat. She said she left her nephew&#39;s graveside and went to an urgent care. She said the doctor at the urgent care had done an EKG result abnormal, and told her she needed to go to the Emergency Room right away. She said the doctor had called the paramedics to transport her from the urgent care to the Emergency Room at (Institute name). She said she did not have any pain, but had a hard time breathing. She said she may have been scared because her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. She said she has chronic migraines, but what she had at the time was a mild headache, and not a migraine. She said she has not smell or taste a lot of the time. She clarified she has had no smell or taste for a while, saying she would not be able to tell if she got the COVID-19 Virus because of her loss of taste and smell.

She said she has had a total of four COVID-19 Virus tests before, and all her COVID-19 Virus tests have been negative. She clarified she did not have a COVID-19 Virus test while she was at the ER on Saturday, 13Feb2021. With her nephew&#39;s death, getting her COVID-19 Vaccine had left her mind. She said it didn&#39;t dawn on her until she settled down, and she thought her high heart rate and irregular heart beat were side effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath. She said the Emergency Room doctor didn&#39;t think to ask her about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she panicked when she got to the hospital. She said she didn&#39;t even know that someone had drew blood from her. She said someone put a label on her, and told her the label was to show blood was drawn from her.

They had to put me into another room that was much cooler and put me into a recliner with feet up, ice behind my neck and on my forehead. I was pushing water so it was not dehydration, and I had eaten my normal healty breakfast also so not low blood sugar. This was my second shot and I had the same reaction with the first shot. It took about an hour before I could stand and walk again, but was still a bit shaky and faintly light headed for about another hour.

Sat down again but had to do so I hung on to the bed, walls, and doors to steady myself to get to bathroom.  Had a little diarrhea.  Managed to take 2 Tylenol and drank lots of water.  I held on to everything again and got back to bed but sat up instead of laying down.  I still had diarrhea so I held on to every thing again and took one Anti-Diarrhea pill.  Went back to bed sitting up and tried to sleep.  Got up around 8 am and felt better but still a little woozy.

A 77-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 77 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included: cholesterol, spinal fusion L4/5, stenosis, allergies to medications, food, or other products: kefex, Zithromax, levofloxacin, oxycontin, methylprednisolone, Lisinopril, ezetimibe, Amlodipine.  She reported she has constant spiking of her blood pressure (BP) and lack of sleep for 37 days (average 1-3 hours daily), since the vaccination. She described the following: She has experienced &#34;dizziness, blurred vision at times, extreme and constant headaches, tons and tons of pain in her neck&#34;. She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function&#34;. When she &#34;lays down&#34;, her &#34;heart is racing so fast and [her] BP gets so high that it won&#39;t let [her] sleep&#34;. She feels like her &#34;body is going crazy&#34;. She &#34;cannot get more than 2-3 hours of sleep other than 1-2 exceptions&#34;.  Also, her &#34;BP wakes her from a dead sleep&#34;.  When she wakes up, she usually &#34;takes a rice [pad] and applies hot and cold to her neck, and she sometimes takes some Tylenol&#34;. &#34;Every time [she] wakes up, her BP [readings] are around 152/101 and 160/97. She has been in and out of the hospital for her high BP.  After the hospital, she called (Number) because her BP &#34;was off the chart&#34;. Her cardiologist ruled out heart issues. She did an &#34;echo, a stress test and EKG&#34;.  On 01Feb2021 she was admitted to hospital with 200/103 blood pressure. Ruled out cardiovascular &amp; placed on Amlodipine. Now 37 Days later with many visits to doctors, blood pressure remains high. Cardiologist ran stress test &amp; echo with no heart issues. Placed on many Blood Pressure Medications that also created side-affects (urination, flushing, dizziness, extreme headaches); Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol 25 mg, Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, Propranol 20 mg. Today, picking up yet another (Hydralazine?) as last-ditch effort. BP daily spikes remain high (160/99 and 175/100). Racing Pulse &amp; BP wakes me out of a dead sleep within 1-2 hours. So weak &amp; constant neck pain that feels like someone is placing pressure around my neck. The blood pressure medication received are the following: Amlodipine from 1Feb2021 until 9Feb2021. She explained it work well to manage her BP but she &#34;could not urinate and had red flashes in [her] face&#34;; therefore, it was stopped by her cardiologist.

                                                She had been in her usual state of health until tonight. Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

                                                The 2-3 days after the shot my mom got a fever (over 100 degrees) and the chills which we were able to control with Tylenol for the most part. However, over the next 4 weeks, my mom gradually lost the ability to control her bladder function, and her ability to transition between sitting, standing and lying down w/o help. She also exhibited even more difficulty with walking than she did before (shuffling). My mother experienced pain all throughout her body, and the pain became as bad as an 8-9 in a range of 1-10. She struggled to raise her arms, reach her arms out, or grasp objects. She lacked energy, she would sleep for 10 hours every night, and she had difficulty concentrating and remembering what she was reading,

She was dizzy, light headed, and these symptoms continued all night and all day Thursday.  She dozed to sleep off and on all day Thursday and was in so much pain, didn&#39;t have to move to have pain.  She is still having some pain today, but feeling much better.  She still is a little bit dizzy.  Feels as if she laid down she could sleep for a long time.  She has pain in her back area, her arms, her hips.  She did not take anything for her reaction as was told not to take aspirin and does not use other medications.  She feels exhausted and if she moves her arm too much and also her legs then they start to hurt.  Getting in and out of bed is easier today, but she could not get them over the bed to get in or out on Wednesday.  Her neck also hurt to turn.  She had similar symptoms to when she had the COVID virus in November/December.  She had been hospitalized for it twice, was informed that she had a stroke after she had passed out.

This 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0171), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies and sinus headaches which she takes (Excedrin) off and on for years in the past, and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included atenolol (manufacturer unknown) taken for hypertension, start and stop date were not reported. Past drug history included the patient received a flu shot (unspecified Flu shot) with a mega reaction she was sick for weeks which was at least probably 15-20 years ago So, she never got a flu shot after that and she has never had the flu. On 29Apr2021, the patient had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, dizzy/light headed, felt like I am going to faint, and ringing in the ears. On an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced allergic reaction. On 01May2021, she was really ill, and her blood pressure went up over 220 and pulse rate went way up. On 02May2021, she experienced headaches. On 06May2021, she was feeling a little weird and nauseous. On an unspecified date in May2021, her memory is a little off right now. The clinical course was as follows: the patient reported, &#34;I had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, it&#39;s okay now, I couldn&#39;t really move it. I feel I may be having a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine (Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine) got on Thursday (29Apr2021) of this past week. I am very light headed, dizzy and felt like I am going to faint, has ringing in the ears, and all that has been going on about a week, since last Thursday (29Apr2021). Then I was really ill last night (01May2021). It started last night when we went to bed around 11 O&#39;clock. I have never had anything like this in my life. My blood pressure was through the roof. With a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope, her blood pressure went up over 220 which was so high that had never happened before, so I took an extra pill (atenolol 25 mg tablet) last night (01May2021) which helped a little bit but not enough, and I really thought that I was going to pass out and be really sick. Because I thought that it was either having a stroke or a heart attack, my husband had to call ambulance to take me to the hospital last night. The systolic and diastolic and pulse rate went way up.  They did chest x-ray, blood work, and urinalysis, and everything came back fine and they could not find anything. They just felt that I was just having a major reaction to the shot so they sent me home. I just got home this morning (02May2021) from having to go to the emergency room. But as soon as we got home, I started with a humongous headache and so I had Excedrin/Tylenol for headaches because I used to get sinus headaches. So, I took that, and it helped a little bit, my headache got a little better. Anyhow, I am much better right now and I am sleeping. But tomorrow it will be the same.&#34; Later the patient also reported, &#34;Today (06May2021) I am feeling a little weird with ringing of ears and is light headed sometimes. Because of the light headedness, I feels a little nauseous. But I am a still very nauseous. I feel like I am going to faint again and my blood pressure I think has gone back up. I am trying to keep calm and trying to figure out what is going on. But I am really afraid if I am having a reaction to the vaccine unfortunately. I am dizzy and I do not want to start getting worst again. I guess I will feel better if you tell me that this happens sometimes and what can I do to decrease somehow?&#34; She also stated that she did contact her doctor about this event but she didn&#39;t get very far. Her memory is a little off right now because she really has not felt well. She stated that her biggest thing is her blood pressure. She also stated, &#34;The only thing that I am really concerned now is about getting the second shot because I already had the reactions by the first shot. Am I going to face the same thing or even the worse with the second shot?&#34; Treatments were received for her blood pressure went up over 220 and headaches. The clinical outcomes of the event &#34;a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine&#34; resolved on 01May2021, the event nauseous was not resolved, while the events, allergic reaction, really ill, felt like I am going to faint, pulse rate went way up, ringing in the ears, dizzy/light headed, Headaches, feeling a little weird and memory is a little off right now were unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 21Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8727) as 2ND DOSE SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, stroke when she was 40, had COVID in Mar2020 (Her cardiologist believes she had COVID too but never did a test) and broke her ankle. Concomitant medication included warfarin sodium (COUMADIN) because she had a stroke and broke her ankle and got a clot from her ankle to her groin; ongoing diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE) taken for paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and hypertension; Chlorthalidone taken for polyuria and hypertension; verapamil hydrochloride (VERAPAMIL) taken for paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for years. Patient received first dose of bnt162b2 on 28Feb2021 in left upper arm. Patient was a retired nurse and stated about a month after the second dose of the vaccine she started getting lightheaded, she went to Urgent Care because her daughter who is a nurse insisted. Her blood pressure at Urgent Care was really, really high, she was having excessive hypertension. Before the vaccine she was on a blood pressure medication for several years and had no issues. She went to see her cardiologist and they moved her from one medication to 3 medications (then add Losartan, Diltiazem) to get this controlled. In the morning she was lightheaded and her blood pressure is high before her morning medication. Diltiazem is 24 hours. She gets up at 3AM and once she takes the medication it seems to be ok. Her blood pressure is reasonable now. It is not like it was initially when elevated. Initially it was 180/88 to 94 when she first went to see the cardiologist after second COVID19 Vaccine. Currently her blood pressure in the morning is usually 154/ 77. That was when she first takes it when she gets up. Later in the morning it is running 110/77. The event outcome was unknown. She was feeling that it had to do with the second injection. Patient considered it was medically significant for high blood pressure and lightheaded, and considered both events related to COVID19 Vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the known drug profile, there is a reasonable possibility of casual relationship between the drug BNT162b2 and the events Dizziness and Hypertension. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 77 years old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number and expiry date were unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on an unknown date at 10:45 AM (3 weeks after 1st dose) as 2nd single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received glycopyrrolate (batch/Lot Number and expiry date were unknown) via unspecified route of administration on an unknown date at a dose of 2 mg tablets daily (once daily in the morning) orally for peptic ulcer. The patient stated that she guesses glycopyrrolate would be expired when the 30 days are up. The patient did not have glycopyrrolate during reporting. The patient had just called the office and ordered a new refill when the freezing thing started. The patient was blind, so she could not read the label and batch number. The patient medical history included blindness called retinitis pigmentosa, diagnosed at 43 years old, she did not take anything for retinitis pigmentosa and it was genetic, ongoing and low thyroid (for several years). Family Medical History was mentioned as none. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number and expiry date were unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm in Jan/Feb2021 at 10:45 AM. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included unspecified thyroid medications (for several years) and unspecified sleeping pill daily. On 25May2021 at 08:45, the patient went for her physical exam, the patient&#39;s blood oxygen was up to 163. The patient added high blood oxygen levels could affect the heart. The patient never had blood oxygen over 98. The consumer clarified she meant low oxygen and not low blood pressure. The patient had the writing on the tape recorder. Recorder spelled the term as Hyperoxia. The patient stated that a week and a half ago, she was sitting in a chair after both of her vaccines but that she started those pills again and felt tired. Tiredness was first noticed after second shot that evening and it lasted for some days. She was taking a nap while watching tv and that lasted couple of days. She would be tired and then have to take a nap, but did not feel bad. The patient sat in the recliner and went to sleep and when she woke up, she was frozen and could not move her body or a finger or anything. She went in around 1400 and had no idea how long she was asleep but her mind was working. The patient stated she told herself to concentrate and to move but could not. She had no idea how long she was in that state but kept concentrating on trying to move a finger and was able to get a finger to move. Her arm was starting tingling like when it falls asleep and she was just cautious when she finally got up to walk. The patient did not visit emergency room/physician office. The patient told that she did not feel this bad before the vaccines and that was why she thought it was the medication (glycopyrrolate) that caused it. The patient started back taking the medication a few weeks after and did not know what it was for and that was why she thought it was this medication. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included high oxygen level 163 on 25May2021 and blood pressure was 133/64 on an unknown date. The outcome of the event blood oxygen was up to 163 was not recovered, Hyperoxia, could not move her body or a finger or anything, Her arm was starting tingling, she was frozen was unknown, Tiredness for a few days after second shot was resolved.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

She wondered if she should call Fire Dept (but wasn?t making total sense).  Her friend came, tried to help, but I think she decided to call 911 for help getting her up &amp; wants EMTs to check her out.  **She had fallen during Covid, went to ER &amp; they gave fluids &amp; she was ?good? for a week, but then dizzy &amp; severe lethargy, same friend took her to ER &amp; she was admitted (negative covid test at that point), but very large PE, thus heparin &amp; then Eliquis (Dec 2020).

                                                Neurology consult 2/13/21:  This is a 78-year-old female we were consulted by Dr. for possible guillian barre s/p COVID vaccine.  The patient tells me that she was in her normal state of health, and she received her 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccineseen 7 days ago.  Subsequent to that, the next day she developed chills, fatigue that continued for approximately 2 days.  She states that 3 days ago, she woke up and was unable to lift her legs or get herself out of bed on her own.  She felt weak in her proximal lower extremities and her trunk.  She denied any bandlike sensations or paresthesias.  She cannot tell me that she developed any distal lower extremity weakness initially but felt that it was the acute onset.  She needed some help her out of bed when she was upright, she was able to use her walker to slowly get to the factor.  She may have had some urinary incontinence, she does complain of diarrhea now.   Denies any tingling sensation, no bulbar symptoms.  This is a 78-year-old female who we were asked to evaluate for possible Guillain-Barre syndrome.  She had acute onset of lower much greater than upper extremity weakness without any definite ascending features, of relevance, is that she received the COVID-19 vaccine 3 days prior to the onset of her symptoms.  She did exhibit flu-like symptoms prior to this.  Given that she does not have any specific area of intrathecal enhancement to suggest Guillain-Barre or other areas of radiculitis, I think it is reasonable to proceed with lumbar puncture to look for any other source.   --Given the findings on the MRI cervical and lumbar spine including enhancement of the bilateral sacral S1 region, I would like Neurosurgery to further evaluate. -- would likely benefit from CT chest abdomen pelvis to rule out any underlying occult malignancy particularly if workup remains unremarkable. -- continue supportive care, monitor for shortness of breath, new vital capacities  Patient remains admitted to the hospital with continued weakness at the time of this report

He took my blood pressure and it was in the high 165&#43; so he called our neighbor who is a registered nurse, she took the blood pressure and now 179&#43; and kept going up and at 190&#43; she called 911 and they took me to the ER at the hospital, they took the blood pressure and it was 212. At the hospital it reached 237 but the dizziness was going away. I came home around 3:14pm. Follow up visit with my doctor on 2/26 and 3/15 by phone call going over testresults. Some of the tests given on 03/02 Electrocardiographics &amp; Vascular lab. Then on 03/15 more test MRI and MRIA. Than on the last Dr. office visit on 03/15 all tests were clean. Before the last visit we did a lot of checking around with people we know (doctors and nurses) about what was going on and mentioned about the Covid-19 vaccine shot given the day before and they mentioned that people were getting dizziness and some vertigo also one we talked with was a nurse, who missed two days of work because she as dizzy the day after the vaccine. So I mentioned this to the Doctor who said he has heard the same thing. He said that this could have caused what happened to me

I called my neurologist and he said that any pre-existing condition can be exaggerated by the vaccine while the system is building up his anti-bodies so I expected but is this going to go away, this thing, is this going to go away and reported just so beside myself, I just can&#39;t live like this anymore everyday you know this is beyond dizzy.&#34; tried taking, I do have a prescription for it starts with M wait a minute it hasn&#39;t helped but I tried it , if it doesn&#39;t help for the first time I won&#39;t take it again but I have a prescription for Meclizine 25 mg Tablets. Consumer stated, &#34;I spoke to somebody earlier and told me to call this number and tell you that what&#39;s going with me. Tomorrow will be one week, since I had my second Covid shot and the first day, I got it everything was fine. The second day I was feeling a little off and I thought okay will they told me that I would feel little, may be not sick-sick but not feeling good and then the second day after that Friday. I got it on Wednesday and by Friday, I have a pre-existing condition and it is called Vestibular Dysfunction. Consumer stated, &#34;I had the Vestibular Dysfunction from 40 years. So, I live with dizzy all the time. But by Friday, it is just unbelievable dizzy, Saturday was worse, Sunday was even worse, yesterday was little bit better. Today, I am still shaking and dizzy and Tomorrow will be one week since I have the shot and I read that stuff happened in the first week and I was wondering, have you had the other people with the same problem, Consumer further added, &#34;It is not an inconvenience, this is horrible way to live. I feel dizzy all the time, this is horrible. Was I told that I should talk to you about, can the shot exacerbate a bad situation like this, they told me to call you, now I getting no help at all can anybody tell me.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Nothing I have no recollection of any of that no, I just started coughing and they told me to go to the emergency room so I did you know In Mar2021. The patient has received treatment with Meclizine 25 mg tablets. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

Had flu like symptoms like she never had before, but this was worse. She did not have a fever, but was flushed and very cold, chills. Her arm was not hurting until about 9pm and during the night she had a rapid heart beat, but not really. Was very anxious like something was going to happen and she tried to calm herself by taking deep breaths but does not know if that worked. Finally, after 3 hours she was able to go to sleep and did go to the bathroom a couple times and felt week with the flu like symptoms, they were very bad. When she got up today she was 60-65% better. She did eat something later yesterday and had thought the nausea was because she hadn&#39;t eaten all day long. The food was flat tasting and she know she has that whenever she has the flu where nothing tastes right. She clarifies she has that anyway since 16 years ago she had cancer and a strong dose of chemotherapy and radiation and her immune system since has not been the same and has been very deprived. Whenever she gets sick she gets deathly sick and has to be watched or she may have to get hospitalized due to weakened immune system. States some people say that the second dose is worse, is that true or is it the same feeling. If she feels like that with the second dose she may not get it. No further details provided. Mentions as the day goes on she comes around more. Has to get her glasses to see card given. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. The outcome of event her immune system since has not been the same and has been very deprived was unknown and other events were not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

She told them that she was going to have a procedure and they told her that it would be okay for her to have the vaccine.  Then she had the procedure on 3/25/21 and then 2 days later she lost the use of her legs.  She has fatigue, no energy whatsoever, it took 3 days for her to be able to get up and walk, and slept on the floor as she could not use her legs to get into the bed.  She did call her doctor about 5 days later and he thought that it could have been a combination of the vaccine and anesthesia from the procedure.  She continues to have the fatigue and no energy whatsoever.

After a month I called the dr. and  was told to take 2 naproxen twice a day to relive  swelling.  T his helped, but when I stopped the pain came back.  Does not hurt just sitting, only when I try to lift something.  Think injection was given in a muscle.  Hurts when I left arm above shoulder.

                                                On 2/18/21, 10 days after receiving the vaccine, I donated blood as usual.  About 30 minutes later I was light headed, had abdominal cramping pain, bowel emptying and possibly fainted.  I was transported by EMTs to the ER and was later diagnosed with inflamitory bowel by a CT scan.  I took antibiotics and was feeling fine.  My gastroenterologist performed a colonoscopy on 3/24/21 and the findings were that I was healed and tissue samples were normal.  3/25/21 I had an annual physical and was told I was in good health.  Later that afternoon I began feeling light headed upon standing.  In the night I called my health insurance hotline because my blood oxygen meter was beeping  continuously.  The Dr. on call told me to go by ambulance to the ER.  When sitting or lying down, I felt fine and all the tests at the ER for my heart and my vital signs were good.  A few hours later, they did a hest Xray and then a CT scan of my lungs which showed a saddle embulism.  I had also  thought I had bruised my knee if and when I fainted on 2/18 and  1o hours later a blood lot was found by ultrasound of my left knee.  I was given blood thinners in the ER and then in ICU where I spent the next night.  I am now taking Eleris.  I was also given pantoprozole for GERD coughing the next day.  I continue to have periods of abdominal ramping/pain, light headedness in waves and pressure in my head.  I have disontinued the stomach medication with some feeling better with the lightheadedness.

                                                I had an unsettling waking event happen to me yesterday morning, so I didn?t feel like I could gather myself to be at an appointment after the event. I was very disoriented upon waking. I could not gather my thoughts and memories. Things like: I knew I was in a city , but didn?t know where the city was in the world; and other things like that. It was as though I had stepped out of my life and didn?t remember enough to step back in. It only lasted maybe 5 min, but was completly disconcerting &amp; disarming. I?ve never had a similar event.  And it came after another disarming 10 min bout of dizziness / sense of off-balancedness and a very slight nausea the night before. It too, was arresting because I had had no alcohol to drink for months. I felt continually better during the early morning and didn?t think about it much during the rest of the day.

She was scheduled to receive her second vaccine and she doesn&#39;t know whether or not to do it. Caller explains she had the shot, and her facility had her wait 15 minutes. She didn&#39;t think much about it. She went to the bathroom to kill some time. It was about 1 minute until it was time to leave, and she was getting her husband gathered up so by the time they got to the door, she could probably leave. Very quickly she had this tiny bit of dizziness and it felt like everything was going dark. She states this episode was very quick and didn&#39;t last long at all. After that, she was totally fine. She doesn&#39;t know whether to have her second vaccine or not. No relevant tests done. The outcome of the event was recovered.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

I cannot walk more than a block, cannot stand for more than 5-10 minutes, Lingering pain all the time.&#34;  Called PCP with this report:  &#34; adverse reaction to my Pfizer 2nd shot.  The next day after the shot it seemed like the vaccine searched out every part of my body that might/might not have arthritis and moving was very difficult for two days.  Thereafter I have had a great difficulty getting up in the morning, some days better than others.  I have seen (chiropractor) often, but results have not cleared up the discomfort.  I cannot walk more than a block without discomfort, cannot sit unless my feet are up for great amounts of time then expect to be able to move.  Is there something that you could prescribe that would give me comfort and be able to walk without pain.  I am not interested in anything that would be considered an opioid, would rather go without.  Currently I am taking Excedrin.  Someone told me that Advil would be better for arthritis, but I had a bad headache on day two of taking that.&#34;  Told to scheduled appointment with PCP for evaluation.

As the days went on she had impaired equilibrium issues, which she is still having therapy for.   She called her doctor after about 4 weeks of experiencing these symptoms every day, and he suspected that since she was dizzy and had equilibrium issues that it could be an inner ear problem, and referred her to an ENT.  She went to the ER with pressure in her chest and headache.  She had an EKG, stress test, doppler on the carotid arteries, and chest x-ray.  All of these tests were negative for any findings.  She then saw the ENT and he ruled out Meniere&#39;s disease, any inner ear problem, ordered a brain MRI.  This showed mild constriction of the small blood vessels consistent with her age and that was all.  She continued to have the problems, and her PCP recommended balance therapy and sent her to therapy for that.  This therapy is helping her, and she continues to still go for the therapy.  Any of the doctors that she saw felt that it was an over-reaction of her immune system to the vaccine.

                                                First dose: Redness in her eyes; First dose: Couldn&#39;t focus; First dose: Pressure behind left eye; Vertigo; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 78-year-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing glaucoma (had it for 7 years), ongoing hypothyroid (started 7 years ago). It took her 5 years to find the right doctor and the right medication. It took a while to balance it off. She has been okay the last 2 years with the right medication; asthma from 1969(controls her allergies, so it did not turn into asthma), ongoing high blood pressure (had it all her life), allergy to glycerin and ongoing vertigo (started way before she had the vaccine). Concomitant medications included ongoing irbesartan (AVAPRO) for high blood pressure (She just went back to it about a year ago because it was doing really good then her blood pressure spiked up) and ongoing levothyroxine sodium (TIROSINT SOL) for hypothyroidism for 3 years. The patient previously took flu shot and then had the flu and got pneumonia. On an unknown date, couple of days after the first dose the patient experienced redness in her eyes, about a week or 2 after the vaccination the patient couldn&#39;t focus. On 06Feb2021, the patient had pressure behind left eye and vertigo (vertigo). There were no relevant tests done. She was being treated for vertigo, but the vertigo was basically gone though she was seeing a physical therapist. The vertigo started way before she had the vaccine. The patient visited physician&#39;s office for the adverse events. The Patient did not go to the emergency room. The patient should have gone to the hospital, but she was afraid to be around people with Covid. She did not get vaccines at all because she fears having a reaction. The last vaccine she had in 2006 made her so sick she got pneumonia. It was for the flu, and she got the flu. The patient did not have any vaccination within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient thought it was important for her to take the vaccine which it took her awhile to talk herself into it because of her previous experience with adverse reactions. She took levothyroxine sodium solution because the patient was allergic to so many things. The first one they gave her was a gel capsule and it caused an itching reaction. The patient is allergic to glycerine and could not take capsules that have a glycerine encasement. The first one they gave her was a gel capsule and it caused an itching reaction. She was allergic to the preservative in eye drops. She did not know if the Covid vaccine had any preservative, she did not think it did. She looked it up and did not see anything she was allergic to. The patient had a long list of allergies. Her family all has high blood pressure and allergies. The outcome of the event vertigo was recovered on an unknown date, for redness in her eyes was not recovering while unknown for rest of the event.   Additional details unable to be obtained.

                                                Feeling unwell; fast heart beat; nauseous; unbalanced when walking; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN9810 and Expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 04Feb2021 14:35 as 1st dose single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included anxiety from Unspecified to Unspecified date. The patient concomitant medication included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for anxiety from Unspecified to Unspecified date. The patient received no other vaccines in the past 4 weeks period. On 05Feb2021, morning, she noticed she is feeling unwell and had a fast heart beat. After eating it got a little better. It says on the paperwork normal side effects to expect like feeling unwell and fast heartbeat which has calm down for her, but she was wondering how long this was expected to last and have the side effect. She was not feeling good this morning. She doesn&#39;t want this to last a long time. The patient reported that after the vaccine she felt nothing, no pain, no pain even at the arm. The patient reported that, she was not completely sure how she was feeling because she was sitting now, she felt nauseous and unbalanced, she was feeling unwell. As she was sitting down, she thinks it was better, but she still feels unbalanced when walking. The patient took half a Xanax when her heartbeat was fast, that was usually the trick that slows it. It was reported that, she takes Xanax for anxiety and maybe that was it was. She took the Xanax because she had to wait on the phone for so long to speak to someone. The second dose was schedule date on 02Mar2021. The patient had so many medications, but had not taken them before this started, she took them later. The patient received list of what she could expect, on the list what she had was a common reaction, but the Fast heart rate was in the call section, but it was not that bad for her to call 911 as she knows a fast heartbeat can happen with her anxiety. She usually gets the flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, she does not remember when she had it last, she usually gets them when it comes out or when pharmacy announces it and asks her. The patient noticed that people who usually get the COVID virus die of Pneumonia, so she thought she would get the pneumonia vaccine. The patient had some exam 2 weeks ago, and yesterday the Physician left a message about the results and did state on the phone that she has nothing to worry about. The outcome of Feeling unwell was not resolved and fast heart beat was resolving.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

I thought I was feeling better, I thought, but I am still experiencing  the issue with the weak legs, being so tired. I also feel light headed lately.  I did see my family doctor 2x and spoke with him on the phone a couple times.  He did blood work, all came back good.

This is the first of two reports.   A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration (right arm shoulder-pending clarification) on 17Jan2021 at singe dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient got the shot on Sunday (17Jan2021) along with her husband. All of the sudden she was getting dizzy, otherwise they had no problem. She even made a second appointment. The dizziness started today (19Jan2021), a couple hours ago. It concerned the patient. She thought maybe because she didn&#39;t eat breakfast, but she ate and that hasn&#39;t helped. She would like to know if dizziness is a side effect because she really doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. The outcome of event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021061667 same reporter/drug/event and different patients.

This 79 years old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284) in left arm, on 18Jan2021 at 12:00 PM or 01:00 PM, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pacemaker (she just had it checked on 18Jan2021 at the cardiologist and they said it was good for five more years), heart issue, dementia (before getting the vaccine). Concomitant medications were none. On an unspecified date in Jan2021 the patient experienced dementia (she had a bit of dementia right now, which she also had before getting the vaccine) and her feet felt like they were numb, like neuropathy (maybe she had that, it had never been checked). Since 19Jan2021 the patient could not walk, had difficulty in walking. She was using a cane as she did not want to fall, she weighed 200 lbs and her partner would never be able to get her up if she fell. She was able to walk with the cane. The patient said that there had been no other treatment for her difficulty in walking and it seemed to get better. The initial caller (patient&#39;s partner) said she had the shot too on 18Jan2021 and did not have those symptoms, she was not the one who was sick, she did not know what else was going on in her partner&#39;s body, they did not think the shot caused it. The patient said she was supposed to be on a sleep apnea machine but she could not get in to the doctor to get the machine checked, it needed a test to be rechecked but they could not get in to do it because of everything that is going on. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 08Feb2021 at 10:00AM. Difficulty in walking was improving. The other events outcome was unknown.

                                                Felt fine the day of event, during the night she felt like she had a heavy head, but when she woke up around 8:00 and she realized that something was very wrong, she could not sit up due to nausea and the room spinning.  She texted her daughter who is a nurse and got there about 1:00 PM, she was still in bed.  When she tried to sit her up she felt like she was going to throw up.  She put her legs over to the side of the bed, and she felt like somebody was pushing her with her daughter over a cliff, in a tornado and on a Ferris wheel.  She started vomiting and having diarrhea.  She had heard about an epley maneuver and after a time she sat her up again and still had the previous feeling of going off a mountain in a tornado.  She did the epley maneuver and tilter her head to the left and was still very dizzy but not as bad.  She then tilted her head to the right and it was not as bad.   Things started to settle down and eventually she was able to get up, still nauseated but 90% better.  She was able to go to the restroom with her daughter&#39;s help.  She stayed in the bed all that day and finally in the evening was abler to keep food down.   She limited her distance to the bed to the bathroom.   Her doctor was notified and called in some nausea  and vertigo medicine (meclizine), which he did and only took 2 doses of that.  The next morning she went up and down the stairs to make sure she was able to.  She was very, very cautious but each day has been better.  On 2/2/21 she called and got an APT with ENT but will not see him in a couple of weeks.  They are going to send a therapist tomorrow to evaluate her for the vertigo.  She is scheduled for the 2nd vaccine on 2/11/21.   Saw her internist today and he evaluated her and did 2 blood tests and sent the referral for the therapist to come tomorrow.

This consumer reported same events for two patients (one is patient self). This is the first of two reports. This 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration to right arm on 13Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfas, Penicilins, and Avelox, Sulfa or Penicillin allergies since she was a child and had the Avelox allergies about 15-16 years ago. None concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. Did get the original Shingles vaccine about 3 years ago and then they came out with the new one and she got the first dose of that and believes she had a reaction to that one, thinks it was a rash. Also had the flu shot and she usually gets sick with it, but didn&#39;t with this last one. Thinks her body is just delicate. No vaccines administered on same date. Patient had the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on 13Jan2021 15:00 and she was fine. She had a reaction the following day (on 14Jan2021). At 11am the next day she got very dizzy and felt like she was going to faint, pass out at any second. Used cold compresses and drank water and took deep breaths, but she didn&#39;t pass out. She had a funny taste in her mouth. Then from that time until about 7pm she had urine issues and kept going to the bathroom to urinate and had diarrhea and upset stomach. Patient felt like she was out of her body, felt very weird, strange. Doctor stated she maybe had a reaction to the vaccine and recommended for her to take Tylenol. She didn&#39;t take it until right before going to bed. She was able to sleep on 14th night. Woke up the next morning and was fine. She didn&#39;t see any of these reactions listed and that happened. Patient explained to a friend of the reactions and the friend mentions that she also had a friend who had the vaccine and had the same exact reactions, everything. Everything improved and stopped the next morning she was fine, on the 15th. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. The events outcome was recovered on 15Jan2021. It was just a span of time and she has to assume that it was the vaccine since she has never had that before. Patient does not know if she should blame the vaccine because she also has a lot of allergies to a lot of antibiotics and does not know what caused her reactions.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021065869 Same reporter/ vaccine/ AEs, different patient

She exercises regularly and has become so weak that she cannot climb stairs.  Neurological exam revealed hyperreflexia, subtle proximal muscle weakness, the presence of a startle reflex and rooting reflex, clonus, and a positive Babinski.  Infectious work up has been negative, autoimmune evaluation is underway.  Inpatient neurology consultation has been obtained, she was given a trial of diazepam for stiff person syndrome and started on daily IVIG on 2/3/2021 for a 5 day course. She continues to have an elevated CRP, a mild transaminitis, and mild thrombocytopenia.  The ESR dropped from 44 to 20 with hydration.  She has had no cognitive changes. No headache, visual changes, jaw pain. We are unable to obtain MRI given the presence of these coils which are not MRI compatible.

A 79-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine; Batch/lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration injection to right upper arm  on 22Jan2021 14:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing she was a fainter (She was a fainter, she just faints so she has a hard time getting shots. Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine administered to her by nurse while she was in her car seat. She just asked the nurse to let her lay down in the car seat when injection was administered so that if she fainted she would not fall far; she was still getting the wash cloth on her head preparing when the Nurse had already finished administering the injection.); ongoing depressed sometimes (she was depressed sometimes, was stressed. She was the primary caregiver for her 96 year old mother. She had seen something about stress and COVID and shots and everything); ongoing  Very tired (She was almost 80 years old so she was very tired often. She was the primary caregiver for her 96 year old mother. By the time she comes home at night around 21:30 she was just wiped.);  Obesity (She was really overweight but she did not like the term obesity.); thyroid disorder; hypertension; Cataract and glaucoma in left eye; family history of ongoing facial paralysis (Dad had Bell&#39;s palsy that might have been 30 years ago. He died at age 87 years.); diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes). Concomitant medication included Levothyroxine at 100mcg taken once daily in the morning early before she eats with Start date unknown, but at least 10-15 years ago for Thyroid. Enalapril at 10mg taken once daily (Caller initially reported product name as Vasotec, but clarified it is not Vasotec, it is drop for eye cataract and glaucoma) for High blood pressure. Brimonidine with Strength unknown, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily, started maybe 1 year ago. Specified cataract and glaucoma in left eye; but drop was administered to both eyes; and left eye was eye affected by Bell&#39;s palsy for Cataract and glaucoma in left eye. The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergy with onset maybe about 50 years ago, she was not sure; occurred during dental procedure; had bad headaches but no lasting effects so they assumed allergy to codeine; she did not know if still has allergy but says she does if asked.  The patient experienced bell&#39;s palsy/developed facial drooping/her eye was drooping on 29Jan2021 with outcome of recovering, may have had a mini stroke on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown , fell on 27Jan2021 with outcome of unknown (reported date of end of reaction was 27Jan2021), she could not blink that eye on 29Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered. Five days later she fell and developed facial drooping.  HCP suggested she may have had a mini stroke causing facial drooping and the fall. She went to the ER on 29Jan2021 and the ER believed it was Bell&#39;s Palsy. She was still experiencing facial symptoms but they are improving.

She was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy in 29Jan2021 after having been seen in the emergency room. She is supposed to have the second dose/booster of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Feb2021. She called to ask if she should or should not still get the second dose as scheduled; and if Bell&#39;s palsy could be a reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The emergency room staff did not know how she got Bell&#39;s palsy, but knew she had the Pfizer COIVD-19 Vaccine and were kind of assuming the Bell&#39;s palsy was a reaction to the vaccine.

On Wednesday, 27Jan2021 she had a friend named (Name withheld) who came over for tea. Patient has an oriental rug, and around 15:00 patient fell face first on oriental rug. She was just fine after the fall initially. She wonders if her having fell has anything to do with the Bell&#39;s palsy. She thinks it was the night of 27Jan2021 or 28Jan2021 when she asked her son if her face looked funny, did she look ok, because her face felt a little funny. She was looking in the mirror and her smile was looking crooked, and her eye looked like it was drooping. When she got up Friday, 29Jan2021 she could see her eye was drooping, and she could not blink that eye. She called her Ophthalmologist who saw her the afternoon of 29Jan2021 around 13:30-13:55.

                                                began to hallucinate; Dizzy; bed nightmare; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 79-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Expiration Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Jan2021 at 79-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included high blood pressure from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, shrunk a little from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (&#34;about 5&#39;9 and I was always 5&#39;10 but I think I shrunk a little&#34;).  Concomitant medications included nebivolol hydrochloride (BYSTOLIC) taken for blood pressure high from an unspecified date to an unspecified date (&#34;I have blood pressure, high blood pressure. I am taking a blood thinner. I was taking the other one, but they told me to look the other one (BYSTOLIC). It (BYSTOLIC) is a new drug I would say.&#34;). The patient previously received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) for COVID-19 immunization on an unknown date and experienced adverse event (&#34;no problem, nothing happened, there were minor things here and there&#34;). On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient began to hallucinate (medically significant), dizzy (non-serious), and bed nightmare (non-serious). The patient did not receive treatment due to the events; &#34;No, I just ignored it.&#34;  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated, &#34;I took the virus vaccination shot (clarified as COVID 19 vaccine). The first one, there was no problem, nothing happened, there were minor things here and there. The second one I took was just this past Sunday. Something weird happened not right away, not the first day but probably it was second day, second or the third day, I am pretty sure I am not sure exactly, I think. I was not keeping track of all of that.&#34; The patient began to hallucinate; and when she got out of her bed, she suddenly had a feeling that she should look back. The patient stated that she looked back and there was her deceased sister (who died 37 years ago; according to the patient) and her daughter who was still alive; both were looking at her. The patient further reported the following: &#34;They remained in my bed beside me. Okay, I ignored it and thought it was kind of funny because I know that my daughter is in (place name) and my sister is deceased. So, I am having a bed nightmare or something, so I ignored it. Then next thing it happened for a few days and then the dog that we just had euthanized, my daughter (name) had cancer and it was euthanized and what happened is, I was sitting on my sofa and I have seen the dog come out of my bedroom going to the bathroom but only the back of her and she disappeared. Then I spent the night at my other daughter&#39;s house and somewhere in the middle of the night I was awake in my something and I woke up and I looked over into my sistert&#39;s dining room and there was my brother standing there looking at me and there was two of his children sitting at the table also. I thought this is getting a little weird.&#34; The patient reported that nothing like this happened before. The patient wanted to understand the event because she &#34;never had been dizzy from my drug, taking the drug (unspecified medication) that made me dizzy but that not the same thing what is going on here.&#34; The clinical outcome of the events was unknown.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

A 79-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  Concomitant medication included atenolol for blood thinner.  The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 for Covid-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event. The patient stated that she received the second dose of the vaccine on 04Feb2021 and has been sick ever since. She has a terrible terrible splitting headache on her right temple and can&#39;t sleep and was having so much pressure behind her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t even lay her head on a pillow. She stated she had no reaction to the first shot but this time her head is all fuzzy, her mind wasn&#39;t good and when she sets things down she can&#39;t remember where they are. The second shot was really giving her a fit. Her throat hurts, jaw hurts, head hurts, and feels like she is running a temperature. She is a little off balance, when she walks she falls into things because she can&#39;t see things hardly in her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t put up with the pain any longer, it is terrible behind her temple and eye. She thought it was a sinus infection but now she thinks it was from the shot. She stated she almost had a wreck today because she cannot see out of her right eye because of the shot. She hit a telephone thing and almost wrecked 3 or 4 times. She tried to get tested for Covid but she didn&#39;t have an appointment and she cannot go to work until she finds out about the virus. She was going to get tested tomorrow but was going to have to call the rescue squad because she can&#39;t drive and she was not putting her son through this if she has the virus. The patient asked if she was allergic to the second shot or if these were normal symptoms. She asked what she should do. She stated she takes Atenolol, a blood thinner, and thyroid medicine. She stated she was taking Tylenol but it doesn&#39;t help any and nothing seems to help. All the events occurred on Feb2021. Outcome of all the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Three days after second vaccine, I started to get sore in left shoulder, two hours later the pain had moved up my neck. By nighttime I could barely move my head to the left and pain was severe.  i was very chilled and could hardly stop shivering until I took a heating pad and dressed warmly and went to bed.  Sunday, still have a lot of pain and taking aspirin for the pain.  Also will use SalonPas for the painful areas to see if that helps.  Still cannot move my head to the left without pain.

                                                Dizziness; feels unsteady at times; nearly passed out/totally passed out; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 27Feb2021 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that the patient received first COVID shot Saturday. She confirms the Pfizer COVID 19 Vaccine. She says 24 hours after she had the shot she nearly passed out, she got really dizzy and someone asked, are you okay, and she said no and they caught her before she totally passed out and she sat down. She is still having waves of dizziness and she feels unsteady at times, not every second but she is a little scared to drive a car. She just thought someone should know that. It was reported that dizziness began the next day on 28Feb2021 around 3pm. She closes her eyes and says she doesn&#39;t want to look at that. It is ongoing but it is not so bad after she gets up. It seems to have lessened after about 3 pm yesterday it is bothersome. She confirms it is ongoing but improved a little since it began. The outcome of the event dizziness was recovering, while unknown for the other events was unknown.

Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events. She was scheduled for second dose on 11Mar2021, but she is scared because of events that occurred 01Mar2021. The outcome of the events diarrhea, &#34;Nose running&#34;, &#34;Her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34;, &#34;her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

Okay I went to bed and about 3 O&#39;clock in the morning, I woke up and I was shivering, I was so cold and I ached all over and I said okay I am getting the flu, went back to sleep, by the time I got up in the morning about 6 o&#39;clock the aching was gone but I could not walk, it was like I was drunk. I have a little dog and she was barking to go out and it was like 0 here so I sat there for a minute and I left her out and she started barking, to bring her back and I could not walk, I kept walking into the walls and my house was just this dark, I thought it&#39;s so dark in my house so I got my little dog back in, sat down and again and I thought what, maybe I will take my blood pressure, so I did and it was 66 over 48 so I though okay, so I started drinking, I thought I got to eat, I got to drink, so I get that, my pressure came up to 80 over 62 or something, my pulse rate was like 116, my O2 stat was like 98 percent so that was not a problem.

I was not taking any blood pressure medication, I mean I have but doctor took me off long time ago, I did not I mean I have no aches, I have no pains, I have nothing just a little bit of headache, not even enough to bother me, every now and then I think about it, I also, I mean I thought I have got to the bathroom, I had diarrhea terribly, something, I did not know if any of this is from the vaccine. I have not called my primary, I thought I called him tomorrow I mean I am fine, I am little short of breath when I walk up to the stairs but that is nothing unusual.&#34; Causality: Reporter stated &#34;I don&#39;t know, I am thinking it does I never had anything like this before but you know I don&#39;t know, I don&#39; know, I am just reporting it, I am 79 so I don&#39;t know how much this is, I don&#39;t know.&#34; When probed from where reporter got the vaccine, Reporter stated &#34;I got it the first one at (Institute name).&#34; LOT# of COVID-19 Vaccine administered on 22Jan2021: Reporter stated &#34;You know it&#39;s not on my little card, just the LOT# of second one is on here.

I feel as though I am wrapped in cotton and am seeing things from a distance.  These events generally go away in anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour.  Sometimes the recur in the same day, sometimes not.  When I am in the fogged state, when I take a step, I find I have no control of, or contact with my lower limbs and I stumble.  This has been going on for over a month.  And the feeling of exhaustion felt after dose #1 and dose #2 has continued intermittently.

We went out to assist her, she was sitting upright with assistance from her daughter when we got out there. As we asked her questions, she was staring blankly at us and not responding to our questions, we called 911. She did not answer us  for as least a couple minutes, although there was a pulse and she was breathing. She was sweating profusely.  Daughter said she was warm and dizzy right after, also that she has a history of fainting  and fear of blood.

I WANT TO BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A CHANCE THAT OLDER PERSONS ALREADY PRESENTING WITH CARDIOMYOPATHY MIGHT BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THESE SYMPTOMS WHILE NOT HAVING THE SAME LEVEL OF INFLAMATION AS IS  BEING NOTICED IN YOUNG ADULTS.   INDIVIDUALS AT MY AGE TEND TO HAVE SO MANY COMORBIDITIES UNTIL THEY MAY BE UNLIKELY TO NOTICE NEW SYMPTOMS.

                                                6 migraines after the first vaccine/Increased migraines; Dizziness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: GR8736 or GR8136), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 04May2021 (at the age of 79-years-old), as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included chronic migraine which she had them for years and then 5 years ago they came back with vengeance, herpes zoster from 01Feb2021 had shingles on her head and shingles pain. The patient&#39;s migraines got worse when she lost her husband 3 years ago, she thought it a stress migraine. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced drug hypersensitivity and botox for the past year for migraines. The patient was having around 8-10 migraines a month prior to starting Botox. The patient was late to get her dose of Botox because of covid and would have to go into the fourth month before she could get it instead of the usual 3 months. The Botox didn&#39;t seem to cover the patient with the vaccine. The patient was due 12Jul2021 for the next dose of Botox, but she had these migraines before then. The Botox had been working very well for the patient prior to the vaccines. The patient didn&#39;t know why the last dose of Botox didn&#39;t cover her like it usually does. The Botox dose was 125 units. They start on the lower dose and up it and see how you&#39;re doing, the highest was 150. Concomitant medications included gabapentin taken for herpes zoster from an unspecified start date to 28May2021; ibuprofen taken for shingles pain from 12May2021 to 28May2021. On 04May2021 (10 minutes after vaccine), the patient experienced dizziness and waiter for 30 minutes and then it went away. On 05May2021, the patient experienced first migraine after vaccine, had migraine yesterday and had migraine brain. The patient had 6 migraines after the first vaccine and 8 migraines after the second dose. The outcome of the event migraines was not recovered and for event dizziness was recovered on an unspecified date.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Amyloidosis; felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head; Eyes swollen; hands hurt; sharp pings up and down legs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 13:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and previously took the flu shot one time and started having right arm pain across her chest over to the left side right after getting it. So she don&#39;t take it anymore and takes a bunch of herbs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she has a disease, amyloidosis on an unspecified date, where there is a build up of protein in the body. She didn&#39;t know that there is protein in the shot and doesn&#39;t know the affects it has with her condition. She found out the day after getting the first Pfizer C-19 (clarified as COVID-19) shot that there was protein in it. The patient wanted to know the affects it has with her condition and if it will affect her getting the second dose and if it covers the new virus and booster shot. The patient got the vaccine on 16Jan2021 and found out about the protein in it the next day when it came across her phone. The patient received it at a school, where they vaccinated 1,169 residents. They text her to inform her she could get the vaccine. They also have the health department there. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient took 1 Tylenol about 15:00 that afternoon and seated herself in the chair about 17:45, then she felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head. She stood up and walked around to see if she was going to faint and she did not faint. She walked through the house and nothing else happened. The patient mentioned that her eyes have been swollen and her hands hurt, that&#39;s where the protein build up comes in the body. Has pings up and down her legs, they are sharp pings that lasted through on to Tuesday. She took 1 Advil to help and as of yesterday (as reported) no pings. Her hands still hurt, because this condition forms chains in the body and the chains are around the hands like carpel tunnel. The protein normally should leave the body and with this condition it doesn&#39;t and it leaves chains. When she was diagnosed with it they took a spot off the ankle to test it, the Dermatologist did and sent it off. No further details provided. Wants to know the affects of her getting the second shot. No further details provided. The outcome of the events amyloidosis and hands hurt was not recovered, the events felt a sweep over her stomach up her body and up to her head and sharp pings up and down legs was recovering, and the event  eyes swollen was unknown.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

Saturday was so dizzy I had to hold on to walls and furniture to walk around house. Sunday was still dizzy and nauseous so I ate a sandwich and 3 or 4 tums.  All came up and I continued to vomit throughout the day. Could not even keep water down. Monday I had someone bring Ginger Ale. Nausea gone, but still very dizzy. Never had a temperature but continue to be dizzy.   I am a very active 80.  Clean my own house and Mow my yard.  I play bridge 2 or 3 times a week and walk my 2 Yorkie Dogs several times a week and never have been dizzy before.

An 80-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9266 and expiry date 31May2021, via unspecified route of administration on 15Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included, broke her elbow from 04Dec2020 and surgery from 12Dec2019 and second surgery was from 15Jul2020; the patient thought that the second surgery on her arm was in 2020 and she actually broke her arm in 2019. She thinks it was actually Dec2019 when she broke her arm and the second surgery was on 15Jul2020; ongoing with the arm the pain and movement in that arm (movement disorder) and arm; weakened (same arm that she broke). There were no concomitant medications. The patient was taking the same medications she always takes, and she waited until after the dose to take them. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 lot number EL02162, expiry date 31May2021 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient was calling about the vaccine, the second Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She experienced some side effects, there was joint pain on 15Feb202 later that nigh and the most obvious thing was exhaustion that began later the same day as well; but one thing was unusual, the strange side effect that has happened on 16Feb2021 was that her hand felt like it was sleeping especially her finger tips it felt like neuropathy but it was much better now, it was the same arm that she broke, it seemed weaker now which it seemed like the side effects go to areas that were weakened before. The patient stated that the main thing was the neuropathy thing, it felt like she was sitting on her hand and that persisted, but it was 90 percent better and she thinks it will go away. The neuropathy feeling was ongoing but much less, it was improved it happens only if she squeezes her hand so it was much less and she hoped it just dissipates. The patient&#39;s main concern was the neuropathy and it has improved a great deal. The patient mentioned with the arm the pain and movement in that arm has worsened since the injection (Feb2021). The worsened pain and movement has persisted about the same since she noticed it. The patient informed that was the joint she guessed, because she broke the elbow. The outcome of the events hand felt like it was sleeping especially her finger tips it felt like neuropathy, joint pain, exhaustion was recovering, same arm that she broke, it seemed weaker now which it seemed like the side effects go to areas that were weakened before was unknown, while not recovered for the rest of the events.

They admitted me to Emergency because my blood pressure was extremely high-they said later it was about 187/ ?.  While I was there the blood pressure went up over 200 to 214/81.  I was dizzy and nausious and shaking because I became very cold even though the nurse covered me with 3 blankets.  After I left the hospital it took until after I got a prescription for meclizine filled and took one at 7PM before I was able to get the blood pressure down to a normal range - 130/64.  Today I am still taking meclizine as prescribed and am still slightly dizzy.  I do not know if this was related to the vaccine or not.

Today is March 13th the arm still hurts not just at the injection site but the pain throbs throughout the arm and it is hard to carry/pick up items.  It&#39;s not life threatening but I don&#39;t understand why it is still hurting  Also I wonder if when I get my second vaccine next Friday, March 19, 2021, if I should get it in my right arm.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Mar2021 13:30 (at 80 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, allergic to gluten, lecithin, and other barky parts of plants, high pressure, she did not hear very well, left breast surgery, skin cancer. She had a small skin cancer taken off each of her legs, one removed in Jan2020 and one removed in Feb2020. They are all healed up and they are fine, it was not the bad kind. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced choking experience in which her throat tickled, and dizziness, dehydrated, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does, couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction all on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown.   Clinical course was reported as follows. She mentioned that she was fine for 20-30 minutes to an hour after she got home. That afternoon, she noticed that her bowel movement was regular, constant, and repeating which was not normal and would typically indicate SIBO (Small intestine bowel overflow) in which the colon empties everything. She mentioned that this was indicative of her gluten allergy. She reported having had bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction she has to plants like lectin and gluten especially due to the irritable bowel system-her whole bowel system will empty and she will have to replace 2 days worth of food. With this event starting 01Mar2021 her bowels just kept emptying and emptying. During dinner while she was eating and watching tv, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, and a choking episode in which her throat tickled, and dizziness that she couldn&#39;t get up. She took hot water for the tickling sensation and took one aspirin for the other symptoms, but she still did not feel very well. She went to bed at 9pm but couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, she only slept like 2-3 hours long which she can get from Novocaine with her teeth. She got up 3 times and excreted a cup of urine per time. In the morning, she woke up and excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does. She got herself weighed and had a weight of 109lbs versus the normal 122lbs which indicated that she was really dehydrated so she took her fluids and ate breakfast. Other than this, she mentioned that she got up today and felt fine and feels that in 2 days she will be fine. She felt pretty good and she was going to run but did not dare burn any more calories or fluids so she is sitting still and taking it easy. Regarding outcome of event she reported the pounding pressure like high blood pressure are better, fine# she had a normal breakfast# she can get around and do whatever she needs around the house except she needs now to spend the day recouping from the dehydration so she needs pay attention to what she eats and drinks. She mentions that she runs 3-4 miles a day and tries to be active for her age. She is asking if she can take the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. She is unsure if this is an allergic reaction or something psychological. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips.

Medical history included Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (states she was diagnosed about 40 years ago), Allergies, lung collapses (due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), preemie, no fusion in her eyes (States she sees out of one eye most of the time), does not retain sodium and potassium (related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), egg allergy.

Concomitant medication included potassium as does not retain potassium; spironolactone; a list of medications. Her mom got her 2nd dose on Sunday and is in the process of needing to report that. She ended up with severe gut, lower abdominal, intestinal pain and bloating along with other normal things. States she saw her doctor yesterday and he believes it could be caused by the Propylene Glycol in the vaccine. Her mother received her shot at 3pm on 4Apr2021 and does not know which arm. Her symptoms started around 8:30 with body aches everywhere, a severe headache, her bones and joints were hurting so bad she couldn&#39;t barely walk much, she made it to the bathroom and that was it, and nausea. Caller states by 10 her mom had hard cramping, that it started at 8:30 with cramping in her abdomen and severe bloating.

Caller provides that her mom continues the same until Tuesday morning and then the intestinal cramping and bloating is still continuing now and it&#39;s more primarily her lower left area as of Wednesday. She has a big history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and her doctor that she met with yesterday feels this is probably from the propylene glycol component that caused the flare up, as she usually doesn&#39;t have this and he is hoping it will calm down in about a week. Her mom also couldn&#39;t eat or anything until Tuesday. She was down all of Sunday night and Monday for about 36 hours.

                                                The morning after Mom&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer shot, Dad woke up and found Mom lying on the floor next to the bed.  Mom said, &#34;I can&#39;t move my arm.&#34; Dad called paramedics who checked her.  They said her vital signs were normal and left.  On 2/9/21 in the morning my da awoke to see that Mom had large amounts of bubbly saliva pouring from her mouth onto her pillow.  Dad called paramedics, who said this was a diabetic reaction.  Mom had NEVER had anything happen like this before.  Mom was very sleepy, could not be aroused, and made only gurgling noises.  She was admitted to the hospital for care and therapy.  She pulled her own IV out.  Mom had to be restrained in the hospital and sedated, due to confusion and worsening dementia.  By 2/18 when we spoke by phone mom&#39;s speech was abnormally slow and very repetitive.  &#34;I&#39;m very tired today&#34; was spoken many times.  In morning time mom was able to follow basic conversation.  Not so later in the day.  Mom came home from rehab on 2/26/21.  She was able to walk steadily and independently at home after her therapy.  After a week or so, Mom began hitting the in-home caregiver.  Dad&#39;s presence would calm her.  In a short time Mom seemed not to know dad anymore, and would hit him and the caregiver when they helped her.  She also pulled all covers off the bed and pulled clothes out of the closet, throwing them all over the room during the night.  Mom was usually walking around the house during each night.  On 4/16/21 Mom and dad were napping sitting up on the couch in the morning.  Mom fell forward and hit her head on the hearth.  Dad and caregiver gave first aid and called paramedics, who took her to the ER.  Mom came home on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 Mom pulled her catheter out in the early morning.  In the afternoon Mom&#39;s appearance was concerning, so Dad called paramedics.  They said that Mom&#39;s BP had dropped very low and took her to the ER. Mom was combative the next day in the hospital.  Dr. adjusted her medications periodically to ensure that mom&#39;s care would be manageable when she would eventually be sent home.  Minimal therapy was done due to dementia.  By 5/3/21 doctor said that Mom is bed bound and needing total care.  Her blood sugar spiked high despite special diet.  Staff waiting for insulin order from doctor.  5/4/21 Doctor called Dad to say that Mom had died during the night.

                                                Patient is an 80 y/o right handed female who is totally independent at baseline who received her Pfizer vaccine out of the country (1st dose 2/19/21, 2nd dose 3/12/21).  She was reactive to both shots, reporting arthralgias, headache, low grade fever, chills. She had a rise in blood pressure later during the day of her shot as well as the next day (up to 180/70, from baseline of 130/70). She also had an episode of epistaxis several days after her first shot.  She traveled independently out of the country on 3/31/21 to visit her son on a leisure trip. On 4/5/21 she had headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, and did not feel well, and her systolic BP was 198, after which she took additional 40 mg of lisinopril.   Her BP subsequently decreased to systolic BP of 130 mm Hg on 4/5/21, but over the next few days she had labile BP with a range of BP of 125 to 171/ 58 - 68.  She was meticulous in checking and recording her BP several times a day, and she increased her lisinopril dose to 40 mg po qd from 20 mg po qd given the higher than usual blood pressure range.  On 4/10/21 her BP was as follows: 6:30 am, 148/60 (she took her daily lisinopril 20 mg po); 11:30 am:  132/52; 3 pm: 171/69 (she took additional lisinopril 20 mg po) after which her systolic BP decreased to 130. Then around 6:20 pm the same day (4/10/21), she had acute onset of headache, vomiting, left sided weakness, SBP 220, and was witnessed to have rapid change in mental status. There was no antecedent trauma to the head. EMTs were called immediately and she had loss of consciousness during the ambulance ride to the ED, after about 20 minutes of symptom onset, with agonal breathing and bradycardia to the 40s, but never lost her pulse. Upon arrival to the ED out of the country, her Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, she was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Head CT demonstrated massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage (140 cc) within the R temporal parietal and occipital lobes, with cerebral edema and 14 mm midline shift, associated with small subdural hematoma and small intraventricular hemorrhage within the temporal horn and body of the R lateral ventricle. They reported hyperdense &#34;spot sign&#34; within the intraparenchymal hematoma compatible with active hemorrhage, no evidence of venous thrombosis, no masses, no arteriovenous malformations. She had 2.5 mm aneurysm right  that was thought to be incidental finding unrelated to her event. She was taken emergently to the OR on 4/10/2021 for decompressive R hemicraniectomy, which she underwent successfully with minimal blood loss.  She had no coagulopathy and her platelets and hemoglobin were normal. She remained in the Neuro ICU for 3 weeks. She received a tracheostomy two weeks after her presentation, and was weaned off the ventilator. She is breathing spontaneously after 5 weeks from presentation. She remains in coma or minimally conscious state, with GCS score of 5-6 as of 5/13/2021.

An 80-year-old female patient (Weight: 53.52 kg, Height: 157 cm) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Feb2021 08:30 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. She is unable to clearly identify the Lot due to illegible handwriting on the vaccine card. She thinks it is EN6200 or EN06200. Vaccination Facility Type: Clinic sponsored by (Name). Vaccine not administered at Military Facility. Medical history included covid-19 from 2020. She was also told that she might not need to get the second dose because of having antibodies. When she had Covid it was mild. She did not have the traditional symptoms. It affected her gastrointestinal system more. It was weird. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. There were no concomitant medications. On 26Feb2021, after she got the vaccine, her arm was killing her. It was awful. She took Tylenol for it. Around 3-4pm she was feeling a little bit weird/&#34;felt a little funny&#34; like she was unsteady on her feet. She was not dizzy. She woke up the next day, 27Feb2021, felt &#34;rotten&#34;, &#34;almost like I felt when I had covid/ felt like she had Covid. Same symptoms, milder form&#34;: slight headache for 3 hours, chills lasted a couple of hours, temperature of 99.6-100.1F for 3 hours. She was awful in the morning and better as the day went on. It remined her of when she had Covid. After symptoms went away, she still felt a little tired. Didn&#39;t feel as good as she did before the day she took the vaccine. Caller said the vaccination Nurse told her that she might have more reaction because she may still have antibodies. Caller asking did she need to get 2nd dose? Should she expect reactions from the second dose? She still plans on taking it. The outcome of arm was killing her was recovering. Her arm is better but if she lays on her arm she can still feel it. The outcome of felt a little tired was unknown. The patient was recovered from other events on 27Feb2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I was very tired and my arm was a little bit sore and I ran a 99  temperature that just made me miserable. I sat around and didn&#39;t do anything because I didn&#39;t have any energy. It lasted 3 days until 02/29/2021. I did not see my Doctor for this.

An 80-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 28Jan2021 15:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included visually handicapped and could not read her vaccine card; vertigo before, a year ago. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had her first COVID 19 vaccination, on 28Jan2021, about 3PM and she will get the booster on 22Feb2021, but it seemed like she had kind of vertigo on 29Jan2021, this just happened in the last hour, all of sudden she felt unbalanced, like her head was heavy, and she was holding onto things when she walked, She did call her primary doctor, he didn&#39;t think it had to do with the vaccine, so she thought to call and ask, she was fine, and then all of a sudden she started to get this kind of vertigo, he asked if her head was spinning, but it&#39;s not, it felt heavy and she has had vertigo before, a year ago, but she doesn&#39;t know. Her doctor told her to rest, so she was laying down, and when she lifted her head she could feel, it was not spinning, she knew she was not feeling balanced. When asked to clarify her question, states she wasn&#39;t sure this happening had anything to do with the vaccination, she called her primary care doctor and he thought it wasn&#39;t, had nothing to do with it, so she thought since she called, she would wait and talk to Pfizer in case, that other people have experienced the same thing. States she was hoping this agent could tell her it would go away in a little while, but her primary care doctor said it has nothing to do with it, but it may have to do with it, it was somewhat of a coincidence that was happened, and she was fine for 24 hours, all of a sudden she started to feel this whatever. States she did not need anything else at this time. Outcome of the event vertigo was not recovered and all other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

This is a report from contactable consumer or other non health professional (patient). A 80-year-old female received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EP6955) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 31Mar2021 as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.

Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) If applicable, list any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine was none. On an unspecified date the patient experienced loss of balance. She was unsure of exact date that it began. Stated she wasn&#39;t sure at first and was staggering and has to hold onto rails when she goes up steps. Stated it&#39;s all day. Stated she hadn&#39;t reported it because she thought it would clear up. she stated it had improved, but was still continuing. Caller added she was a very active person so she just didn&#39;t associate it with anything other than her age, when it first started she just felt like it was her age, then she calculated that it started soon after the shot, and confirms it was after the second shot. The outcome for the event Loss of balance was recovering and Staggering was unknown.

By night, muscle ache was continual and continued throughout the night.  Very difficult to walk. Sunday ... called Telehealth around noon, They triaged me into Dr.&#39;s office.  By Sunday afternoon, less discomfort, but still a headache. During this discomfort time, I would take 2 Tylenol (500 mg), which relieved it. Before I settled down for the night, I took 1 Tylenol and when I woke up at 3:00 a.m., the ache was not there (the Tylenol would have worn off by then). Monday a.m. ... could walk much better. The headache and the constant muscle ache are gone.  Nurse called; I am to keep watch, and if there are any changes for the worse, I will go into the Dr.&#39;s office.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 21Jan2021 08:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included lymphoma from 2018. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer. The patient previously took rituxan for lymphoma (Reported she had been in remission for a little over a year. She said she had received only 4 Rituxan infusions for the lymphoma before she went into remission). 12 hours post injection: she &#34;experienced significant rigors and shaking, muscle and joint aches, her equilibrium was off at some point, she was tired, had generalized pain, and chills&#34;. She also confirmed feeling better.  She stated she heard the the second dose of the vaccine caused more reaction than the first dose and would like to validate the information. She explained the first instance she experienced rigors was after a lymphoma treatment. She believed the rigors lasted &#34;12 hours&#34; but was not certain because she &#34;fell asleep and got warmed&#34;. The patient felt great all day on 21Jan2021 after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said almost exactly 12 hours later, she started to have rigors. She was shaking so hard that her hands and body were jerking. Her muscles and joints were hurting, her equilibrium was off, she ached all over, she had pain, felt tired, and she had chills. The rigors started first. She said she felt really cold at the same time, so she went to bed and covered up, trying to get warmed. She fell asleep for awhile, and then woke up and went to the bathroom. When she went to get out of bed to go to the bathroom, she stood up, and every bone and muscle in her body hurt. She said she was aching all over, and her equilibrium was off. She didn&#39;t feel like getting up, and finally went to sleep to get the rigors to stop. She felt cold all the time now, but the rest of her symptoms had improved. She said it seemed like the muscle in her right leg was still pretty sore. She said she recovered from the rigors completely. She had rigors once before when she had an infusion. She clarified the infusion was Rituxan. She said she had a reaction to her first treatment of Rituxan. She said she had rigors when the Rituxan infusion was first started. She was given a couple things (but she didn&#39;t know what those things were), and she stopped shaking. She said the infusion staff waited a few minutes and tried to restart the Rituxan infusion, but she would have rigors again. She said the infusion staff tried slowing down the Rituxan infusion rate, as well. She said the Rituxan infusion normally takes 2 hours, but after 8 hours, she had only got about 20% of the Rituxan infusion, before the Rituxan infusion was stopped. She stated she had 3 subsequent Rituxan infusions at later dates, and did not have any problems with those infusions. Her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine was administered high up in the muscle of her left arm, close to the shoulder joint. She said the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection didn&#39;t hurt, and her left arm never got sore. She said on 30Dec2020 she had lab work done for her oncologist. She went about every other month for blood work to make sure she was still in remission. She saw her oncologist on 06Jan2021, and her oncologist said her blood work looked pretty good and was better. She asked her oncologist about the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her oncologist said she definitely wanted her to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. Her next appointment with her oncologist was in Mar2021. She said she had been seeing her oncologist every month, but her oncologist this time, wanted to try seeing her after 2 months. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of events rigors, shaking was recovered in Jan2021. The outcome of events muscle and joint aches/her muscles hurt, equilibrium was off, aching all over, tired, bone and muscle in her body hurt, hands and body were jerking was recovering. The outcome of event feels cold was not recovered.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

I couldn&#39;t turn over to the left or right when down because of the pain. It was not shortness of breath. It was pretty bad. This pain lasted about 3 weeks.  Soreness is my arm appeared the day of vaccination but that went away within 2 days.  I also kept sneezing non stop, and my nose was runny this also started about 48 hours after vaccination. It is better but not completely gone yet. The sneezing is not constant, as of today but still there.

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid disorder, and bleeding. The patient stated &#34;I am bleeder. My father had hemophilia and I have the female version which I never remember what it&#39;s called but I bleed easily but I didn&#39;t bleed at all for when I had the shot, it was fine.&#34; Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). Patient stated, &#34;Yes, I took my medication that morning. I take thyroid medication, blood pressure medication. I don&#39;t remember what I take for blood pressure.&#34; The patient reported &#34;Well I am calling I felt just fine right now. I had my first shot by Pfizer on the 24th and I felt great and they watched me and I left and I was driving home and I had a dizzy spell while I was driving. I don&#39;t know if I passed out or not, I might have but if I did, it wasn&#39;t for very long, they were digging up the road I couldn&#39;t stop, couldn&#39;t park so I made it home okay and I was fine the rest of the day but then the next day, I had a lot of dizzy spells but I was at home so I didn&#39;t worry, I just sat down and I was okay and then the 3rd day I got up for breakfast and I bumped into everything, I dropped everything and then I started to get out of chair and the chair fell down and I fell down and that was just a mess. So, I went to bed and I felt at least if I fall, I fall on bed and that was the day I was dizzy but then it went away and I have been fine ever since. That began on 24th, the 24th was the first day and I did call my doctor and I have been trying to call here and I never think it through but finally today, sat to watch, hang on to the phone and what I am concerned about is getting my second vaccine. Is there anything I should watch for or tell anybody or, because my doctor said you shouldn&#39;t get dizzy but I did?&#34; The patient confirmed the vaccine as Pfizer&#39;s Covid 19 vaccine. About the lot number, the patient stated, &#34;It looks like EN, I am not sure if it&#39;s E and N 6203.&#34; The patient further reported, &#34;No, I just went home and the first day I was over with it by the time I got home and I didn&#39;t had anymore. The next day I just sat down and rested, I knew it will go away and it did and then 3rd day I went to bed and just thought I would fall and hurt myself and that&#39;s everything I did. Well I used to be 5 foot 2 and a quarter but I think I have gotten shorter, I don&#39;t know what I really am but little bit shorter than that now and my weight is 100 and lets see, I am going to say 170, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s exactly right but it&#39;s pretty close to that I think, I didn&#39;t really weighed myself lately. 5 foot 2 and a quarter that&#39;s what I was when I did last but now I shrunk and less than that but I don&#39;t remember what I am.&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 29Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9262) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation (Indication: Felt that getting COVID at her age would be worse than getting a possible reaction to the vaccine). Patient had an allergic reaction to the swine flu vaccine in 1979-1980. Patient had muscular problems that resulted from the Swine Flu shot. She had weakened muscle. Most of the time she was okay, but she was more prone to getting back pain and stuff, not pain on her side and on the front side like she has now. Patient wanted to know if the swine flu shot and the covid 19 vaccine had similar ingredients. The Swine Flu shot was back in 1979 or 1980. This is the only type of flu vaccination she has ever had. She did not take more after that. She does not have a lot number to provide. She does know though, that a lot of people at that time came down with (Name) from that vaccine. With this vaccine, nobody seems to be getting strong side effects from it. No Other Products. Patient History reported as No. No Investigation Assessment. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced pain in her arm statin she could not raise her arm for a day. Her arm bothered her: she could not lift her arm on 30Jan2021and recovered on 31Jan2021. The patient experienced a day later pain and inflammation on her right side of waist and in the back down in to pelvis, ovary and groin area muscle with not recovered (reported as worsened). Caller stated that it was quite painful describing the pain as muscle pain and inflammation. Caller stated that this pain had not gone away. Caller stated she was due for her second dose and wanted to know if she should get the second dose based on her side effects to the first dose. The patient was having to take anti-inflammatory medications for the pain associated with her side effects to the covid 19 vaccine. Patient thought she had a reaction to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. The day after she had the usual side effect of her arm bothering her. Then she started to experience pain and inflammation around her right side from the waist area down to the front of her pelvis to her groin muscle. It seems like pain and inflammation. It has not gone away. If patient stays home and did nothing she felt a little better. If she took an anti inflammatory she also felt a little better. If she was going out and doing something it flares up. That was why she felt it was muscular, it felt inflamed. Caller stated that it overall had gotten worse in the last few days. She was doing more things than the first couple of days. Treatment: The anti inflammatory was Diclofenac 25mg. She had also been taking Tylenol at night. She said that it does not make the pain completely go away, but it helps keep the pain tolerable. Did not have either of these medications on hand to provide the lot numbers. The outcome of event Her arm bothered her: she could not lift her arm was recovered on 31Jan2021, of other events was not recovered.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 11Feb2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 81-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Feb2021 18:30 (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included (caller mentions she dyslexia but this was prior to the COVID vaccine). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (taking for 6-7 years) at unknown dose and frequency for an unknown indication. On an unspecified date the patient experienced pain in extremity and dizziness. Caller, reporting that she took the COVID shot and was told that if she is on a blood thinner she shouldn&#39;t have gotten the vaccine, is that true. She asks if we make Eliquis. The only small issue she had after the vaccine was some pain in her arm. She worked the pharmacy at one time. She got the shot on 10Feb2021 at 6:30pm. Treatment: Hot compress to the area. Caller remarks that just now when she stood up, she noticed she was slightly dizzy. Could that be caused by the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pain in arm (pain in extremity). The clinical outcomes of the pain in extremity and dizziness were unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible.

Reporter seriousness for pressure in both ears and equilibrium affected: Medically significant, Deafness right ear: Disabling, Arm soreness: non-serious  Reporter causality: deafness in right ear: Causality: strong suspicion it&#39;s related to the vaccine, maybe not necessarily the vaccine itself, but her immune system reaction to the vaccine. Causality for pressure in both ear, arm soreness and equilibrium: related; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of  events such as deafness,balance disorder and ear discomfort cannot be totally excluded.

                                                Two days after patient&#39;s first vaccine@ about 4 pm, I could tell that something was wrong with her. Every day she and I play cards, but this day she was really struggling. She couldn&#39;t figure out where any of the cards went, and was missing every play. I tool her up to lay down. At about 6pm, her eyes looked really glassy and she was unable to speak clearly. Her words were very slurred, and her sentences did not make any sense. I called 911, and they came and took her to the ER. The doctors said that she had a small stroke. She was put on a low dosage of blood pressure medicine, and was hospitalized for 6 days to monitor her. During that time many tests were run on her.  2nd Vaccine- 2-24-21 Two hours after returning from getting the second vaccine, the patient went upstairs to go to the bathroom and she passed out onto the bathroom floor. Again, when talking to her, her words were slurred. She was very weak. I called 911 again. Initially they were not going to take her, but when she went to get up she fell back down. She was too weak to walk, so they took her to the ER again. She was released to go home that evening. Sher saw her primary doctor and was referred by her oncologist to see a hematologist. She endured a three month waiting period until she could be tested for APLS. She will go this Friday to find out the reslts of that test. Additionally, she saw her vascular neurologist, Dr. He looked at her scans and said it was NOT a stroke. He said that  her body basically had a surge as a result of trying to fight off the vaccine. He said that the CAT scan that was done at the time she went to the ER the first time did NOT indicate signs of a new stroke, but that what they were seeing on the scans was from her past stroke. Dr. said that he saw no indication that she had another stroke and that her body was just reacting to the vaccine. He said that all of the symptoms that she had were all things that could happen because of the surge.

An 81-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 81-year-old in Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included bladder cancer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Caller states &#39;&#39;My sister and I both received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. My sister developed Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration two weeks after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. They did find a half cm tumor in her fallopian tube. Her doctors have reported the side effect but at that time she was not fully diagnosed. They thought at that time it was meningitis .&#39;&#39; Caller wants to know if Meningitis or Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration has been associated with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Response: Spoke from the attached document. These two disorders have not been listed as side effects associated with the vaccine. However we may not have the list of all the possible side effects associated with the vaccine. Caller was reporting side effects for her sister related to the Covid 19 vaccine. Her sister had received the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine and 2 weeks later developed a disorder called Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. They had found a tumor in the fallopian tube that was a tiny half centimeter tumor. Said that the doctors had reported the side effects but at the time it was not yet diagnosed as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. At the time, they thought she had meningitis. The event happened about 2 weeks after the vaccine, so about 11Feb2021, was about 2 weeks before or 2 and a half weeks before 11Feb2021 that she got the vaccine. She was in the hospital 10 and a half weeks (about for 74 days). She contacted Pfizer, she believes in Mar2021. Since Feb2021 she had been in 3 different hospitals. They did send her some paperwork but she has not completed it yet. At that point in Mar2021 her diagnosis was meningitis. As it later turns out, it turned to a new diagnosis of the Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Her sister lives in PRIVACY, she does not even know where she went for the vaccine. She hasn&#39;t filed the written report yet. She was not diagnosed with the Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration until the very end, 10 days before she died. She died on 24Apr2021. Cause of death: They had removed her ovaries and fallopian tubes had the suspicion that this might have been the diagnosis without ever seeing the tumor. She had multiple CT scans (2021) and never saw the tumor until they removed the fallopian tubes. They found a 1.5cm tumor in the fallopian tubes which is what the cause of death was. She was calling to see if this has happened to anyone else. They say the tumor was the cause because it would have been so odd that it came on so suddenly, 2 weeks after the vaccine. The caller is terrified to get the vaccine, since she had bladder cancer. She had asked if anyone had reported this because that was the diagnosis at the time. They did not do an autopsy, probably because that was up to her brother in law and can understand why an autopsy was not done. They also say when her sister was having all of these bizarre symptoms, it was an auto immune reaction. She was perfectly fine and had come home from a bird watch. She had severe headache, eyes would move back and forth involuntarily in 2021. That never went away. She had severe vertigo in 2021, and it all happened in one day, it didn&#39;t go away. They did an immunoglobulin infusion treatment, she had very good treatment. They put her on steroids. The immunoglobulin treatment was for five days and nothing touched those symptoms. They had moved her from one hospital to a rehab facility in PRIVACY. The rehab doctor reported all of these symptoms to Pfizer. At that time, they were still calling it meningitis. He said that the elephant in the room was the vaccine. Felt the vaccine is not totally what caused it but accelerated what ever was going on with her, these bizarre disorders. Maybe this would have happened without the vaccine. They will never know. She wishes that someone can tell her whether or not she should get the vaccine. She asked her doctor who said he was not going to tell her to not get the vaccine. She was calling to see if this has happened to anyone else. They say the tumor was the cause because it would have been so odd that it came on so suddenly, 2 weeks after the vaccine. She had asked if anyone had reported this because that was the diagnosis at the time. The patient was hospitalized for events for 74 days. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The patient died on 24Apr2021. An autopsy was not performed.  The outcome of event half cm tumor in her fallopian tube/1.5cm tumor in the fallopian tubes was fatal. The outcome of events Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and meningitis was unknown. The outcome of other events was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: half cm tumor in her fallopian tube/1.5cm tumor in the fallopian tubes

An 81-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6205) (at the age of 81 years) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. Medical history included low back pain, overactive bladder urgency, allergies: dye in CT scan, type 2 diabetes mellitus, flu, been achy, hip replaced about 2 years ago in 2019. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; atorvastatin taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; glimepiride (GLIMIPRIME) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; omeprazole taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Patient previously took modafinil (PROVIGIL). Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 08Feb2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9264) (at the age of 81 years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, was the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that patient experienced intense pain in upper thigh, both legs, sometimes unable to walk, general muscle weakness, began 48 hrs post-2nd vaccine (also reported as occurring on 10Mar2021 22:00). Became less in 24 hrs, became intense again in another 24 hrs, and has continued ever since. Patient cannot sleep at night. Patient clarified she had it ever since 48 hours after second dose on 01Mar2021 and it&#39;s very unpleasant and does not know what to do about it and wanted to report it. These did not happen immediately and after second vaccine, patient did not have any problem till 48 hours, 10 o&#39;clock, she had it on Monday at 12:00 and at 10 o&#39;clock in the evening on Wednesday, she started to get intense pain on right side, she could barely walk and she have never had pain there before and she tried to walk and she was 81, she goes to the bathroom frequently with bladder issues and that was hard and it went on all night. In the morning, she had it not only in right leg but upper side like above the knees but in the front not in the back of the leg and then the next day, when she woke up and then, she had it in the upper side in left leg and closer to the groin and more like around and didn&#39;t know what to do and she wasn&#39;t going to go to an emergency ward as she was 81 and she doesn&#39;t go around that easily. Patient called her doctor, and patient had pain pretty much all day and he said how was it now and told him that it was slightly better. He said more than likely it will go away but he kept saying these are the kind of side effects that they were reporting though flu like achiness was nothing like what she had, she have had the flu (history) and been achy (history) but this wasn&#39;t like that. This was intense pain and it kind of changed a little bit during the day but it was still there. Her doctor said, if it doesn&#39;t go away by tomorrow morning which was Friday, then make an appointment and come in to see her, she will do blood work or whatever. So, she got an appointment for 2:30, by noon, it was just gone totally gone like if it never had been there. She cancelled the appointment then yesterday she got it back again and she could hardly walk but it wasn&#39;t as intense, it was really painful and hard for her to walk and it was around both legs and she doesn&#39;t know what to make of that, she went to rheumatologist because she thought she might be having muscle pain in arms from something else, he did some blood work (unknown results), he couldn&#39;t make anything out of it and he said he will look at the blood work and he gave her kind of a steroid cream to rub on arm (treatment) which she thought she had a problem but months ago (consumer was not sure). Now she couldn&#39;t sleep last night, it was so uncomfortable, and she had to go to the bathroom several times and again it really hurts to walk. So, that was what happened to her and she would not call that achiness of the flu at all. Regarding treatment, patient took Tylenol, do take other medications but nothing unusual and take the same that she always have and by the way the intense pain was only in one leg for twelve to twenty hours and then all of a sudden it began in the left leg as well and slightly with different pace but still on. The one in the right leg was most intense, she could barely stand. For laboratory test, the &#39;BUN&#39; test was outside of the parameters and after getting several tests he did, she wanted to see if she had some sort of rheumatoid thing and they are all in her record. This was not one of the typically adverse reactions that people reported at least according to what she read and according to aspects of it. The outcome of events pain, muscle pain in arms, and BUN abnormal was unknown while for other events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

An 81-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for Injection, Lot number: EN6208, Expiration date: Jun2021), via an unspecified route on an 10Mar2021 and first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for Injection, Lot number: EL9266, Expiration date: 31May2021) via an unspecified route on an 17Feb2021, both as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid and blood pressure. Concomitant medication included lisinopril taking for about 4-5 years and levothyroxine taking may be for 15 years for thyroid. On an unknown date after receiving the first dose, patient experienced stomach upset, nausea, sinuses, tiredness, muscle pain and dizziness. She feels so unwell that she went to the emergency room after the first Pfizer Covid vaccine administered on 17Feb2021 for feeling so unwell. They could not find anything wrong, hence not admitted her. She had improved some but was not really good when she went for the second dose on 10Mar2021. Therapeutic measures taken as a result of the events included antibiotics after the first dose for sinuses and possible ear infection and treated with amoxicillin Clav 875/125mg tablet, dosage two times a day for 21 days, came in an orange colour. The clinical outcome of the events was still experiencing the same side effects after the second dose.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 21Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Thyroid issues, whole body hurts, car accident in 2006 (lost her arm and husband, she only has part of her right arm), A-Fib, cardioversion (about a little over a month ago), heart disorder. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for heart, thyroid medication. The patient previously received the Shingle shots for immunization and experienced tired the next day. The patient experienced increased heart rate, felt dizzy and sick on 21Jan2021. She got the shot on 21Jan2021. She was ok at first but then about 4pm when got home she felt dizzy and sick. She took her heart rate and it was 156. She had A-Fib but just had a cardioversion about a little over a month ago so this really scared her. She felt really sick and didn&#39;t want to go into the hospital. She was ok overnight other than her heart was beating too fast. She took her heartrate this morning (22Jan2021) and it was back to 67-70. Today she is just taking it easy. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room/Physician Office. The second dose is due on 13Feb2021. She is leery of getting it but is going to talk her heart doctor about it and will also see her primary care doctor on Monday. She had a Thyroid issues, things like that. Basically her whole body hurts, this is something that was going on prior to the shot. The only issue with the shot is the increase in her heart rate. There was no treatment, she had nothing to take for this, she doesn&#39;t think Tylenol would have helped but she doesn&#39;t know. The patient&#39;s mom had cancer. The outcome of the events was recovered on 22Jan2021.

She thought my reactions to the shot were probably a normal immune response to the vaccine.

Woke up Thursday morning and couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  I was dizzy and nauseous.  I got up 3 times to use the bathroom and couldn&#39;t even swallow water until 9:30 PM.  I had 1/2 cup soup and water that evening.  Thursday I was only slightly dizzy but was able to eat and drink.  I didn&#39;t feel well enough to leave my house until Sunday.  Today is a week since the second dose and I&#39;m almost back to normal, but still tired.  FYI, I did have COVID last March.  I was quite sick but not hospitalized.  I received phone calls every other day from the DOH during the almost 3 weeks I was in isolation at home.  I gave plasma 3 times after recovering.

An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 19Jan2021 (Tuesday), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization; and pregabalin (Unknown manufacturer), via an unspecified route of administration, on 22Jan2021, at 75 mg, twice daily, for an unspecified indication. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient took her first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine last Tuesday, 19Jan2021 (a week before the reporting). The patient felt fine as of Wednesday and Thursday (20Jan2021 and 21Jan2021) but started to feel dizzy and off balance on Friday (22Jan2021). The patient did start taking the generic medication, pregabalin on Friday (22Jan2021), took one pill that morning, then got extremely dizzy, has not taken any more since, still just feeling off balance. The patient was prescribed pregabalin twice a day but only took 1 pill, it is a new prescription. Medication (pregabalin) was started on the same day as the event but prior to onset of event. The patient had been dizzy ever since, it really feels more like she is just off balance. The patient can function, just an off-balance feeling. The patient read on the information sheet for BNT162B2 that dizziness could occur in the first 15 minutes. The patient was asking and wondering if this is a delayed reaction to the vaccine. This is why she thinks it could be a delayed reaction to the vaccine because she only took one pregabalin pill and it should be out of her system by now. The patient was just going back to the effect today (25Jan2021), the patient was not dizzy (as reported but also reported as not recovered), but she cannot walk, and she was little off balance. The patient was just wondering if that could be a side effect and if there was anything to be worried of. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable; and for pregabalin was temporarily withdrawn on 22Jan2021. The patient had not recovered from the events.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of pregabalin in the country of incidence. This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of pregabalin has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.

I was beginning to get slight pain in my back by late afternoon the same day.  By bedtime, it was much worse.  I woke up around 2:am to go to the bathroom.  I couldn&#39;t even stand up.  My husband was able to help me and get me back to bed.  I had excruciating pain with every step.  I couldn&#39;t bend, turn, etc.  I spend all of the next 2 days in bed.  Yesterday, on the 3rd day, I was able to sit in a chair for a short time.  Today I am better and can get along without assistance.

Upon exiting rest room, client experienced weakness, mild light-headedness with elevated BP of 203/98.  She was evaluated by paramedics on site who recommended further evaluation.  Client declined stating she felt better and would take her medication when she arrived home. RN encouraged her to call her physician when she got home. A friend drove her home . A follow-up call was made at 1:46 p.m. by reporting RN.  Client stated she took medication, was resting and BP was 168/70, and she was planning to call her doctor.  She felt the episode was due to the exertion of going directly upstairs to the rest room, rather than sitting down in observation area.

An 82-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cancer and blood pressure issues (she had been treated prior to vaccination). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient received her first dose of Pfizer-Biontech Covid19 vaccine on 27Jan2021. She has since been feeling dizzy, light-headed and &#34;crummy&#34; in Jan2021. She reports going to the ER (emergency room) yesterday morning (08Feb2021) reporting an elevated blood pressure, with dizziness and a sensation of tingling on the right side of her chest and her right arm (the same arm that was vaccinated). Her MD says that she should not take the second dose, but her daughter-in-law who is a nurse says that it is her (the patient&#39;s) decision. On 27Jan2021, patient had been having issues with her blood pressure- sent to the ER yesterday morning- blood tests twice already. BP elevated and dizzy because she had a burning sensation in her chest and right arm in 2021. The patient supposed to get second dose on Wednesday doctor says not to take it, since she was experiencing adverse event, and her HCP sited the deaths in as a reason for her not to receive the second dose. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                Got her vaccine, came home drove herself, had no problem whatsoever, felt perfectly fine during the day.  She then went out, got lunch, brought it home, nothing about the day was out of the ordinary other than the vaccination.  She often stays up too late and watches TV in her recliner and falls asleep.  She guesses she didn&#39;t put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn&#39;t come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn&#39;t remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn&#39;t remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI&#39;s, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn&#39;t think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn&#39;t understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.

                                                Fell; This is a spontaneous report based on the information received by Pfizer (Mfr Report# UNT-2021-002835). A non-contactable female consumer reported an 82 years old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation on unknown date.  Co-suspect medication included treprostinil sodium (REMODULIN, Lot# 937303, Exp. Date: 31May2022) 10 mg/ml Subcutaneous  at 0.070 ug/kg for secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension since 09Sep2010. Relevant medical history included secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension (ongoing). Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) and tadalafil (ADCIRCA). On 18Jan2021, 10 years 4 months 10 days after initiating SQ Remodulin, the patient fell after receiving the COVID vaccine and was hospitalized.  Action taken with SQ Remodulin was not reported for the event of fall. At the time of reporting, the event of fall was considered as resolved on 18Jan2021. The patient was discharged from the hospital on 22Jan2021. The reporter did not provide causality for the event of fall.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the event of fall as not related to SQ treprostinil considering that the patient has been on drug for more than 10 years. Fall was likely an accidental event in this elderly patient or could be caused by a syncopal episode associated with the underlying PAH or could also be associated with the administration of COVID vaccine. Additional information has been requested.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

An 82-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 11:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, at 82 years old. Medical history included history of a stroke from an unknown date (previous history of a stroke 19 months ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2(Lot# EW5318) on 07Feb2021, at 82 years old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event (no reaction). Other historical vaccine included Flu shot (influenza vaccine) on an unspecified date and experienced almost killed her. The patient reported no reaction and no problems (no pain, no nausea, no anything) from the second dose until the evening of 08Mar2021 when she was in her kitchen cooking and chopping vegetables, she felt the sudden urge to faint and then became so dizzy that she had to lie down on the couch. She had an overwhelming feeling of dizziness. A feeling like she wanted to faint, and she never faints. Her daughter got her to the sofa. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. The room spun unbelievably. Everything spun. She went to bed and when she woke up, she felt worse. She states that the dizziness was worse, she was unable to visually focus, if she closed her eyes and she opened one eye it would be blurry and the people on TV were sliding off the screen and  everything was sliding away, and she had pain behind her left eye into her head. When she tried to get up to go to the bathroom the room was spinning. It lasted through the next day (09Mar2021). When she got up, she couldn&#39;t put her two feet on the floor out of bed without leaning towards the left. She didn&#39;t fall. It was so bad she had to grab onto things to walk.  During that day they brought her downstairs and she stayed on the sofa and it just got worse. Her daughter had her call her primary care doctor and he said that if her neurologist had heard any of what had happened, then go to the emergency room, to which is where she was 19 months ago with her stroke. She spent the 11Mar2021 and 12Mar2021 in hospital (due to dizziness). They couldn&#39;t find anything. She had not had a new stroke.  She had every test known to man. They did a full neurological work up including an MRI, CT Scan, carotid artery studies and checked everything and could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke. The told her that she could potentially have an inner ear problem or problems with the &#34;crystals in her ear&#34; which could be causing her dizziness, however, they could not positively identify the cause of her problem. They found evidence of her previous stoke. When they were sending her home, it says on her discharge paperwork, they were going to put her in a vestibular clinic. It has to do with crystals in her ear. She was still dizzy and still walking with a walker which she hasn&#39;t had to use in 19 months since her stroke. And she has slept a lot, the night she was discharged on 12Mar2021 and the following day. On 14Mar2021 she woke up a little bit. But on 15Mar2021, she is very tired and very weak and still very dizzy. The dizziness is not the room revolving kind. She is taking an anti dizzy pill. She has to see her doctor tomorrow morning, her neurologist at hospital. The dizziness is still persisting but not as bad and she can jump up and walk and do things with the walker. Regarding tests done at the hospital, she came out with shining colors apparently.  All tests came through fine. There was no evidence of stroke, her blood pressure, triglycerides, fluids or liquids, everything tested perfect. When querying if she had gone to her physician&#39;s office, she reported she had a morning call with her doctor on a phone appointment and he sent her straight to the hospital. She is still dizzy and walking with a walker which she has not had to use in 19 months. She states that doing a lot of hand-eye coordination exercises at home. She has the television on to check her vision which seems to be returning to normal. She stated, &#34;I just don&#39;t know where to go from here.&#34; She stated that she has a follow up appointment the following day with her neurologist. She wanted to know if this side effect has been reported and how long she can expect to feel this way.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on Mar2021 which included blood pressure, triglyceride, fluids or liquids: tested perfect; and CAT scan, EKG had unknown results. On 11Mar2021, CT Scan: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem); MRI: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of overwhelming feeling of dizziness and unable to visually focus. Outcome of the event dizziness was not recovered; outcome of the event unable to visually focus (visual disturbance) was recovered on an unspecified date in Mar2021; while room was spinning (spinning sensation) was recovered on 09Mar2021, while unknown for the other events.

An 82-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscular, administered on left arm on 17Feb2021 09:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included quadruple bypass on Oct2020 with symptom of difficulty breathing. Patient was sent to heart system downtown and they cold not do an angiogram and stated she was filing a complaint against her original doctor because he sent her out to have a heart attack or stroke. The family doctor took an x-ray and said it was fine. The hospital kept her a week to get her restarted and doctors were worried of the artery involved, and was also worried if she would have a heart attack. Patient did not have pain, even now, except where surgery pain in legs was and her legs have scars. Other medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity. Patient lost height; she was 5 foot 2 inches and was probably 5 foot 0 inches now but it has not been documented. Weight was about 102lbs. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) in which patient got black and blue marks along the way. Patient previously took flu shot in Oct2020. Three days later after vaccination, on 20Feb2021 patient developed vertigo and still had it. The doctors have been doing tests but haven&#39;t got the final report. Patient reported she had even had the make you dizzy test done. She has had vertigo before but it usually only lasts 3 or 4 days max. On 26Feb2021, patient went to urgent care to see a doctor and confirmed that patient had vertigo and that was all the doctor could do. Since then, patient has seen her regular doctor, heart doctor, had audio tests, MRI radiology and seen and ENT. Patient stated that this was very disturbing. She can&#39;t drive go to store to even get toothpaste and she was used to being independent and doing this. Initially she thought the vertigo was not related to the Pfizer Covid vaccine but since has heard from people in the groups that she was in that vertigo was a problem other people have had. Patient was pretty active, just had quadruple bypass and she has been walking and everything. This going on has limited her. The vertigo has changed but she still can walk around generally. If patient turned her head or looks up she gets dizzy. She can&#39;t do yoga exercises because she has to look up and she is sensitive to that. Laying down, head on pillow or headrest was bad. She has a leaning aspect and that leaning right or left feels like a balance problem. Treatment included Epley maneuvers which hasn&#39;t worked. Patient stopped taking Meclizine per doctor&#39;s order and has been taking gingko biloba. She was taking some medication that could make her dizzy, but it has not, and she was on them on for a while. They have a dizzy effect. However, patient did not think it was from the other medications. She thought it was triggered from the shot. Patient reported no immediate reaction Pfizer Covid vaccine except it hurt on an unspecified date. Outcome of the event of vertigo was not recovered while for the remaining event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021392500 same reporter/drug/event, different pt

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 82-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8737; Expiration Date: Jul2021, NDC number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Apr2021 (at the age of 82-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included had headaches most of her life, she knew it was her cervical spine because of bone spurs, arthritis, and bulging disc; she has also had change in vision, she was coming down the road from seeing her cardiologist and was looking down the road, out of right eye the road continued straight, but out of her left eye it looked like the road was turning off to the left, it was actually going straight, her eye doctor had told her that her eyes were no longer compatible, she was having five prisms put in her glasses, the neurologist was concerned, the eye thing started four or five months ago; she had shrunk to 4 foot 10 inches or 4 foot 11 inches, she used to be 5 foot 2 inches and shrunk because she had osteoporosis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient reported that she had diarrhea one day in Apr2021. She started coughing some yesterday (14Apr2021). Then she was coughing more a little later. That was not what she would normally do. 14Apr2021, she was moving her winter clothes out to her summer clothes. She worked for three to four hours. Then she got so sore and was hurting all over. She felt the same this morning (15Apr2021). She was wondering if muscle aches could be a part of it. She was really hurting last night (14Apr2021) all over. She woke up this morning and felt sore. She was better now. It was from the waist up to the rib cage and all the way around. It was general, all over. She felt so badly last night (14Apr2021) and didn&#39;t feel great this morning. Another reason she was calling was because she saw her neurologist three days before and he scheduled her for an MRI of her head and brain. She had the appointment for the MRI on the 21Apr2021. She had been told that particular test was a magnet test and not radiation. She wanted to make sure there was nothing in the vaccine. They were not sure what the vaccine was going to do. They were not sure what was dealing with. Diarrhea started a couple of days before in Apr2021 when she was out of town, just for one day. It had stopped, she had recovered completely from the diarrhea. Coughing started on 14Apr2021. It was kind of a deeper cough. She had a little coughing 15Apr2021, but mainly body aches that started late 14Apr2021. She hobbled around and went to bed and got up to go to the bathroom and was having a hard time walking because she was so sore on 14Apr2021. The soreness was all over the body. She was having the MRI on her brain and head because she had been having headaches in Apr2021. She has had headaches most of her life. She had seen him (neurologist) several years before. She knew it was her cervical spine because of bone spurs, arthritis, and bulging disc. The doctor said that was the reason for a headache, but this was a different headache. It extended from behind her eye on the left side to the back of her head. It came on suddenly and she would have it for two to three days. Then that side of the head when she was turning in the left direction was sore and hurts. The headaches that felt different had been on and off for the past several months. She would have them for 3 days running and then maybe get a reprieve. She didn&#39;t want to take the second vaccine and had that on top of each other with the MRI. She wondered if she could take the second vaccine a little later. She was not comfortable getting it around the same time of the MRI. The outcome of the event diarrhea was recovered in Apr2021, sore was recovering, outcome of the other events was unknown. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age 82-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient states that about a week and a half to two weeks after, her left knee started to swell and reports that it is painful. She states that it is not an &#34;excruciating&#34; pain but does report that it is really bothering her and that it is stiff. She is concerned that this may be an autoimmune response to the vaccine. She also mentions that she received her second dose of the vaccine the day before yesterday. The patient states that when she took Tylenol and placed ice on it, the swelling seemed to go down a little bit and does not know if she should continue with icing it and resting it, or if she should see her doctor. Outcome of the event was not reported.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

It&#39;s more in my right arm and I cannot lift my arm when it&#39;s happening and it leaves me weak, trembling and in a cold sweat and sometimes I&#39;m real hot. In February I went to the hospital and 4 doctors looked at me, I stayed there one day overnight .  I kind of think that I was given the whole vial of the vaccine and want to know how long will it take for it to wear off, I watched them draw up the vaccine and they gave me everything in the vial. I think I got the whole vial.

                                                dizziness; fell on to her bed; feels extremely tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 15:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and no concomitant medications. Everything went fine, she felt good, nothing at all happened; then, in the morning about 8 AM or 9 AM of 20Jan2021, when she got up, she was very dizzy and she fell on to her bed and her little dog jumped on top of her, her dog was scared. She did not know if this normal thing after the vaccine. She is going to go to her regular arthritis doctor on 08Feb2021. She sees an arthritis doctor but she doesn&#39;t think that would have any bearing on this. She didn&#39;t to call them but she was thinking about calling them and telling them about how it felt. The dizziness had majorly resolved but she just feels extremely tired on Jan2021 and she is really okay but she wanted to make sure that they knew what was going on. She is just watching TV and seeing the new president come in and taking it easy today. She felt wonderful the day after she got the dose and she is not very easy person to have problems with her health, she is like a horse so this is surprising to her. She is fine now, just tired which is not anything unusual she just wanted to call to make sure they knew. She is never dizzy, she does not have any problems with her health. The administration of the vaccine does not hurt her at all, just like nothing ever happened. Outcome of the dizziness was recovered on Jan2021 while of the remaining events was unknown.

Began forcing fluids as symptoms persisted. Slept almost all of the following two days and nights. Now 3 days have passed, much better now but no appetite, still forcing water and juice. Worse than any flu I have ever had! This was my 2nd shot. After my first shot I had slight fatigue and a sore arm only.

A contactable consumer (patient herself) reported that a 83-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech covid-19 vaccine, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: Unknown, NDC number: Unknown, Expiration date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included surgery on her hips and radiation on her head. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, &#34;caller felt dizzy for about 30 minutes after the Covid vaccine she received on 28Jan2021. A few days later, she was still dizzy at her home. Also reported a history of a surgery on her hip which made her feel unbalanced&#34;. There was no PQC present. She would like to know whether she should get the second dose of the Covid vaccine; whether dizziness is a serious reaction; would she have any benefit after just one dose of the Covid vaccine; would like to know my recommendation on whether to proceed with the Covid vaccination series. Individuals who had received one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to complete the vaccination series. The caller wanted to find out what she needs to do. She had her first dose of Pfizer vaccine on the 28Jan2021. After she had given first dose, she stayed for half an hour, but her daughter said she needed to stay longer but when she was about to walk away, she felt a little dizzy. When she got home, she never mentioned this slight dizziness to the Pharmacist who administered the vaccine. She did not know it was important. After a few days, she read the pamphlets and saw dizziness is not a good thing. Several days after the injection, from time to time she would feel dizzy that she needs to hold on to something so that she will not fall. She was 82 years old and she had surgery on her hips and radiation on her head. She would like to know that what she needed to do about her situation. States that on 28Jan2021 she received a vaccine the Pfizer Covid vaccine, the first one, after sitting at the pharmacy for about 30 minutes she went to her car and was dizzy as she was walking, has a walking cane that she walks with because she is not young and has problem with her hips, did drive herself home, did not know there is a problem with being dizzy after the vaccine, after a few days she because dizzy and had a problem walking in the house, had to hold on to things, decided to call to find out what is the next thing that she should do, when she finally read the flyer it said that if someone is dizzy this is a serious thing. Caller wants to know what she should do, caller was encouraged to reach out to her health care provider for medical advice. Caller already filed a report. Did not have a reference number. Asked if the information she already provided could be looked up. Woman was reading a disposition about Pfizer and got disconnected. Caller asked should she take the second vaccine. Caller stated she used to be 5 foot 5 inches, stated she was shrinking. Declined to provide email address. Declined to provide HCP information. There was no product complaint to report and medical information requested. Outcome of the event dizzy was not recovered (reported as persisting) whereas had a problem walking was unknown.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

We saw red bumps and gave her topical benadryl, but irritation still persisted.  We called her primary Dr and she recommended we give her oral benadryl.  Yesterday we were out to lunch and the way home mom fainted in the car so we called an ambulance.  They kept her over night for observation.

She had felt well and had been in her usual state of health, and was able to cook and enjoy a turkey dinner with 5 individuals on 03/07/21, but on 03/08/21 she began to develop progressive generalized weakness up to the point where she remained in bed for several days.  She could not support herself when attempting to rise from bed.  She noted poor PO intake with nausea, no vomiting.  Loose stools for several days, no noted stool blood.  Did endorse waves of lightheadedness and had fallen backwards three times in the prior week, reportedly due to poor balance when standing.  She was unable to elaborate regarding the falls but admitted to hitting her head at least once, unable to say if she lost consciousness or if she felt presyncopal symptoms before falling.  She had initially presented on 03/12/21 to ED for evaluation, workup negative, labs and imaging normal.  CT brain found no acute process.  She was sent home with arrangements for home PT.  She returned to ED 03/15/21 when symptoms had not improved.  In the ED she was found to be afebrile, significantly hypertensive, mildly tachycardic, &#43; orthostatic vital signs.  Labs significant for heme occult positive stool, proBNP 397, WBC 10.1, H/H 13.4/39.9, PLT 493, UA neg for infection.  COVID neg.  CXR found slightly increased interstitial markings.  MRI brain found no acute intracranial abnormality.  She was evaluated by PT and found to be unsafe to DC home as she could not ambulate without leaning backward and to the right and needed 1-2 assist.  She was admitted to HM service for further management.  She has remained consistently afebrile.  She continues to experience significant gait instability, cognitive slowing, and difficulty with finger-to-nose testing with noted dysmetria, no focal weakness.

A few days prior to second shot i developed irritation on 2 days of left foot.  Following second shot, I had sore arm for a day and a half, joint pain at left hip that extended all the way down my leg which caused difficulty walking.  That pain lasted for 2 full days.  The toe irritation developed into painful blisters and extended to 3 toes on my left foot.  I am currently using Hydro cortisone cream on them.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a Contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Her leg was swollen and there was edema and there was a lump on the side and it was pink or getting red and she was on medicine (Clarification Unknown) for 7 days, twice a day and the leg is still (incomplete sentence), the edema has gone down some. The leg was still pink and it is tender to touch and if she stand on her leg for too long or walking around too much it hurts. She got pain. She was also sleeping whereby she was watching television and all of sudden she was sound sleep and she wake up over an hour or two after that and then she awake for a while but she have no trouble sleeping at night again. She had chest pain and it&#39;s not angina because that she did have (Further clarification was unknown if consumer had angina in past hence not captured on tab) but it&#39;s a sharp pain and it does not want her taking Nitroglycerin because it went away and it last for maybe (incomplete sentence) it just like a stabbed wound.

An 84-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249) via intramuscular at arm left on 13Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for prevention because of age group. Medical history included hypothyroid diagnosed many years ago, having Covid in Jun2020. Concomitant medications were unknown. The patient was really sick from an unspecified date.

Her joints were aching at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021.  She had a fever and not really chills, but she just never could get warm and was really cold at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021. She went to bed and woke up on that same date, 13Jan2021, and it started at 11pm.  She guessed it was disabling.  As it went on, it got better. By Friday, she was finally able to eat. She has plenty of weight to fall back on for not eating. By Friday, she started eating again. She was still not back to normal yet though. She just felt like she could not get up. The fever only went on for a few days. Left arm was sore after injection and she had a lump and was itching 13Jan2021. It worried her.  The lump was still itching and sore, but was getting better. Reporter stated that the shingles vaccine did the exact same thing to her with the lump under her skin and itching.  It was given on her hip because she had small arm and they were scared to give it in her arm. The reporter wanted to know if there were elderly people in the trial and did any of them have COVID. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. Seriousness for In bed 2 days was reported as disabling. Seriousness for Could not eat, Fever and really cold was reported as not serious. Seriousness for Left arm sore after injection with lump and itching was reported as medically significant.

I fell backwards into the bathtub  knocking down both shower doors.  My legs were hanging over the edge of the tub.  One shower door fell on my upper right chest area.   This happened just over 24 hours from when I received the vaccine.  I had not felt bad at all from the vaccine.  Didn&#39;t sleep too well that night (2-4-2021) because I hurt due to the fall.  I called my doctor on 2-5-2021 to let her know I fainted 24 hours after receiving the vaccine and wondered if that was due to it.  I do feel weak today (2-5-2021).

An 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm on 21Jan2021 17:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included oral cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received flu vaccine for immunization and reported that it made her sick for 10 days 4 or 5 years ago. The patient previously took Tylenol (takes 1 instead of 2, Everything she takes half the recommended dose). The patient experienced fast heartbeat, increased BP, weakness, dizziness, nausea and headache on an unspecified date in Jan2021. It was further reported that she had a fast heart beat, her blood pressure went real high, she was dizzy and weak. This was while she was there and being watched for the 15 minutes by a nurse. She is 84 years old and doesn&#39;t take any medication; she did have oral cancer but with no chemo as it had not spread and this was 2 years ago. It was explained that the patient didn&#39;t feel good about it but she drove home. When she got home she was confused and felt like she could pass out. She walked through the house didn&#39;t know who she was, she just kept walking and walking. It was a strange feeling that lasted 15-20 minutes. She called her son late in the afternoon and told him to check on her to make sure she made it through the night. She still had funny feelings over the next few days but at this point she only has the dizziness that happens occasionally. She notes also that her blood pressure was checked at home by her and was higher than normal the first few days after but is now normal. Over the next day she had a headache and a little nausea, but it was not severe. She also mentions having a little soreness in her arm but not bad. She did read about the side effects and states she had the elevated heart rate, increase in blood pressure and dizziness right after getting it. The patient wonders could she ask for smaller dose, she only weighs about 110lb. When she spoke with her doctor she was told that the COVID virus is worse than what she experienced after the vaccine. She has not been to the doctor since getting the vaccine, she just talked to them. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: high and heart rate: fast on Jan2021. The patient was recovering from dizziness, the outcome of nausea was unknown and the patient recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

                                                She got the vaccine, she had no effects, and no reaction whatsoever. The husband had no side effects either.   On 3/16/21 they were on their way to go to bed and the bedroom is upstairs and she was fine, she was in the bedroom getting ready for bed, and her husband followed 15 minutes later and when he got upstairs she was sitting in a chair next to the bed, and he noticed that when he spoke with her that she did not speak clearly back, and was very low tone, not much loudness to her speech.  He didn&#39;t think much about it, and he talked with her again and noticed that she seemed to be having some difficulty talking, but he could understand what she was saying if he paid close attention.  He then realized that something was wrong, and asked her how she felt and she said she felt strange.  She was trying to take a pair of socks off and could not reach them.  She tried to lift her leg to put one knee over the other for her to remove them and was not able to do that.  He helped her take the socks off, she wanted to put some cream on her foot and was not able to do so, which is her usual routine.  He put that on her foot while he was talking to her, and her speech was different than it was earlier.  She was wearing a turtle neck shirt and was not able to take it off to get dressed for bed.  Her husband assisted in dressing her to get ready for bed.  He was thinking that she may have been having a mini-stroke.  She tried to get up from the chair and was not able to get up on her own.  He went to try to help her to lift her and it was hard.  When she did get her bottom up off the chair she stayed in a bent position and was not able to stand up.  He put her back down on the chair and tried some more times, and ultimately able to get up and he was able to get her into the bed (the chair was next to the bed).  She could sit on the edge of the bed, but was not able to move her legs on her own to get into the bed.  He struggled to get her in the bed and was not in a mood to talk and just leaned over on one side to try to go to sleep.  He told her he was going to get the walker in the basement for her to use.  He brought up the walker and put in by the bed, and informed her that it was there, and reached to see where it was in the event that she needed to use it through the night.  She did get up around 3:15 this morning to use the bathroom and her husband asked if she needed assistance, and she said that she was able to get up and go to the bathroom, and moved her legs just slow and was able to use the walker.  She was feeling much better at that time.  She got up one more time during the night and was not in need of the walker and was back to bed.  This morning when they got up at 8:00 Am and she was back to her normal self.   She came down the steps and was like nothing had ever happened.  They called her son who works in the hospital and he told them to call us to see if there were any other people that had the same reaction.    She stated while he was giving me this information that she did not recall a lot of the events that he was telling me.

                                                A few days after receiving my second vaccine shot I lost my hearing. it was mostly in my right ear .  Went to Dr he gave me Afrin for 3 nights, flonaze during day and claritin.  After one week no improvement.  Went back and was given predzone for 10 days and went for a hearing test.  Test showed way below normal both ears.  Now have an appointment with an ENT specialist next week.  Ears seem to build up with pressure and noise and cause lightheadedness.

A non-pregnant 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 13Apr2021 (at the age of 84-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidaemia (HLD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM2). Concomitant medications included regular prescribed medications for HTN, HLD, DM2 (drugs unspecified). No other vaccines prior to four weeks. Known allergies were unknown. No COVID prior to vaccination. Covid test post vaccination in May2021 was negative. The patient had no acute issues prior to her 1st COVID vaccine. In Apr2021, the started experiencing progressive weakness and poor appetite to the point of hardly being able to walk. The patient saw her primary doctor who ran some blood work and noticed she was dehydrated with mild elevated liver enzymes and WBC count. The patient was admitted to the hospital (for 21 days) for IV fluids and was on oral antibiotics. The patient started having some SOB and scans done indicated possible lung infection. The patient was switched to IV meropenem which did not help. The doctors also noted some lesions on her liver and a small mass in her lung (no biopsy was done cause she declined) which they said were suspicious for cancer. The patient then suffered a large ischemic stroke and she passed about a week later. The patient was feeling well before her vaccine and everything started to go downhill after her vaccine. AEs result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent covid test: negative in May2021. The outcome of events weakness, decreased appetite, unable to walk, dehydration, elevated liver enzymes, white blood cell count increased, short of breath, lung infection, hepatic lesion, lung mass, and lung cancer was unknown. The patient died on 27May2021 due to ischemic stroke and infection. An autopsy was not performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information  and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported suspicion on malignancy and BNT162B2 use is  unrelated while the causal relationship between the remaining events and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. There is limited information available which precludes a more meaningful assessment. However, the underlying conditions and the age of the patient maybe risk factors.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate; Reported Cause(s) of Death: ischemic stroke; infection

Medical history included blood cholesterol (abnormal) and psoriasis. Concomitant medications included ixekizumab (TALTZ) for psoriasis and statins for cholesterol. The patient took injection on Thursday (21Jan2021) morning. Yesterday (22Jan2021) the patient began to get, her left knee had some pain and like a swelling. The patient didn&#39;t know if that&#39;s related to the injection. It was not her right knee also, it was only her left knee and it looked like it&#39;s inflamed a little bit in the areas to the interior of my knee toward her upper leg. It was very painful to stand on or walk on. The patient did not have any pain at the injection site. She did not have any fever that she was aware of, she had no nausea, she was not dizzy. The patient wanted to know if the reaction that she had in her left knees was possibly connected to the injection. The patient put some ice on it and had no other treatment. Outcome of all events was unknown.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

An 85-year-old female patient started received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9264 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm, on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was received on 11Jan2021 (lot number: EL0142) Medical history included GERD. Concomitant medication included pantoprazole and other unspecified product. Patient got the first shot of the COVID vaccine three weeks ago, and she didn&#39;t know anything had happened to her. She got the second dose of the vaccine yesterday at noon, and she was fine, although she didn&#39;t sleep very well on 01Feb2021. But the morning of 02Feb2020, she went in the kitchen and dropped some blueberries because the plastic boxes don&#39;t close easily, and she bent over to pick the blueberries up and she got dizzy. She did not know why she should get suddenly dizzy, and her stomach seemed a little upset, but she has no fever on 02Feb2021. Patient was just wondering if the dizziness is a side effect of the vaccine. Patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine and stated when she had the incident where she bent over and was dizzy, it felt just really terrible, but she was feeling fine now, but the incident did shake her up a bit. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                fainted; passed out and was unconscious; still kind of feel weak; bruise on both knees; fall; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable registered nurse (patient, Retired RN). An 85-year-old female patient received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982) at single dose via an unknown route injection in left arm on 23Jan2021 around 08:15 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high which was controlled with medication, allergic to penicillin and acetylsalicylic acid;ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN).  She had lost weight and shrunk according to when she went to the doctor 2 months ago. No other products were taken. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect; no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine, no events following prior vaccinations. No family medical history relevant to the events. Patient passed out on her way home on 23Jan2021 (unknown time). The event required a visit to Emergency room, but not a Physician office. The event clinical course was as follows: She got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. Patient reported that after being monitored at the vaccination site for 20minutes, she left to go catch the bus and fainted before boarding the bus.  She remembered getting on the bus, but did not remember crossing the street. She passed out and was unconscious. An ambulance was called and they took her back to the hospital where she got the vaccine. She was taken by ambulance back to the ER, stayed for half the day, she received IV fluids, and a brain scan due to her fall. She stated that she still feels kind of weak as of 29Jan2021.  She did not know what time it happened, because she lost her sense of time on that day because she did not remember. When she got to the hospital she woke up and wondered where she was because she did not remember what happened. They got an x-ray of her head to see if she had bumped it, but it was negative. She did have a bruise on both knees. They gave her IV fluids, and kept her there for a little while, then sent her home. She called her doctor the next day, but he was busy, so she talked to the nurse. No treatment was recommended, just said to get a lot of rest. She was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 13Feb2021 and was scared to death. Patient verified that she was not admitted to the hospital. Investigation assessment were performed. They hooked her up to the monitor, did an x-ray and a CT scan while at the hospital on 23Jan2021 which were normal (both fine), and gave her IV fluids. Outcome of fainted, fall, passed out and was unconscious was resolved on 23Jan2021. Outcome of kind of feel weak was not resolved. Outcome of the other event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of fainted and unconscious cannot be fully excluded.  The underlying history of high blood pressure for this 85 years old patient  might provide an alternative explanation.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Severe and acute swelling of right hand. Hand was swelled to an extent that only the top first joints of the fingers were discernible and this prevented use or any movement of fingers. Swelling began on April 19th, late afternoon. Swelling peaked on the 20th very severe, and gradually subsided over following days. Now 10 days later, hand is again usable, with very little residual swelling, though still visible different from left hand.  Took Advil for 4 nights beginning on the 20th, and everything seems fine now. Despite 30 years of rheumatoid arthritis, no such swelling event or attack had ever occurred for any reason, so we believe it was related to the vaccine, and felt we should report it. But everything seems fine now. No other reactions or side effects were noted.

An 85-year-old female patient received second dose of (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: and expiry date was not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Feb2021 (at the age of 85-year-old), as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: and expiry date was not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 85-year-old), as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that the events happened after the second dose of the vaccine. The patient received the second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine on 16Feb2021. A couple of days after, on 19Feb2021, patient had chills, patient was dizzy, aching all over, had a fever, and it felt like she had the flu. These symptoms resolved within a day, she felt better the next morning when she woke up. A few weeks later, the patient thinks it was 01Mar2021, she began having joint pain that was quite painful all over. The joint pain seems to be worse at night than during the day. Last night the patient had a joint pain attack, it was extreme, the patient wanted to die. It was in the patient&#39;s shoulders, knees, and joints. Patient has been prescribed 3 or 4 medications and opioids, none of which have worked.  She took one of the pills last night and 6 hours later, she had an attack with pains in her shoulders, knees and joints. The reporter and patient called 911 but they did not take the patient to the hospital or admit her. The patient took one of her opioids last night- Tramadol HCL 50mg and 6 hours later the joint pain attack happened. The Tramadol did not help the patient&#39;s pain, in fact it made it worse.

An 86-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EC9231, expiry date Apr2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from 13Apr2020 and she got a plasma donation, in Apr2020 because she was not in good shape when she had COVID. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported) on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter said that the patient&#39;s doctor told her to still get the COVID vaccine and on 10Jan2021, she had been throwing up, sweating, and lightheaded and these were the side effects with the second dose. The caller stated that no one else had side effects like these. It was reported that the patient had no other family and the reporter felt really bad for the patient and wanted to get her some sort of information. The patient said that she was feeling a little better than she did last night, but she was laying in bed. The patient&#39;s symptoms started yesterday 10Jan2021, the next day after receiving the vaccine. The reporter said that the patient can barely speak to her. She said that the patient said that she was feeling a little better, but she just whispered it. The reporter asked if it was because the patient had antibodies. Clinical outcome of the events was unknown.

I offered to call 911  and did so after she consented.  The police arrived within two minutes and the ambulance arrived approximately 90 seconds later.  The police officer was interviewing the patient (who was still conscious and alert) about what was wrong.  I was asked what the patient received.  I responded that she had been given the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine and was then told that I could go back inside by the EMT&#39;s who showed up relatively soon thereafter.

An 86-year-old female patient (mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 12Jan2021 10:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for years; COVID-19 Virus from 23Apr2020 to an unknown date, patient was not on a vent or in the ICU but did receive plasma as part of her COVID-19 Virus treatment; ongoing cough. Caller&#39;s grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and had significant side effects. Patient weight was 175 lbs as provided by caller, who stated her mother recently moved into an independent living facility, and gained weight because the facility has a really good pastry chef. Patient height, reported her mother shrunk, and was 5&#39;5-1/2&#34;. Reported her mother couldn&#39;t walk after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was not able to walk the next morning, 13Jan2021. The caller stated she had to spend 3 days with her mother, after her mother received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021. Reported she thought initially what her mother was experiencing was either neurological or muscular. She said it was like her mother&#39;s brain wanted her to move, but her mother&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t move. She said her mother needed to use a walker and have someone hold her from behind. She said now, at a week later, her mother still was not back to normal. She clarified her mother needed a walker to maneuver around, but didn&#39;t need someone holding her from behind. Reported she assumed her mother may have had tiredness, weakness, severe muscle weakness from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She clarified if her mother wasn&#39;t able to walk after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, then what her mother had was the epitome of weakness, and the weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body. She said her mother had tremendous fatigue on days 2, 3, and 4 after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was able to function as of 19Jan2021, but her mother couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open during that time period. Reported her mother developed a congestive cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not continual, but persisting. She stated her mother said the cough was there before she had her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The caller stated she disagreed with her mother. She said her mother has COPD, but her mother was not a cougher. She said her mother&#39;s cough now, reminded her of the cough her mother had when her mother had the COVID-19 Virus in 2020. She clarified her mother was tested on 23Apr2020 for the COVID-19 Virus, and diagnosed positive for the virus on 24Apr2020. The caller said she was perplexed by her mother&#39;s cough, and her mother will be seeing her doctor this Thursday, 21Jan2021. She said she gave her mother some Robitussin for the cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not persistent, but the cough was still there. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not constant, but her mother&#39;s cough was congested. She said she didn&#39;t know when her mother&#39;s cough started. She said she thought giving her mother the Robitussin doses was kind of insignificant, because her mother did not have a constant cough, where she needed to take the Robitussin. She said her mother didn&#39;t even use half of a normal sized Robitussin bottle. Caller stated she did not have the Robitussin UPC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reported her mother has an annual lung x-ray and MRI, clarifying she believed her mother had both within the past 3 months. Reported her mother was concerned about receiving the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she told her mother that it was better to get the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine than to get the COVID-19 Virus again. Reported her mother had asked her primary care doctor if she should get the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her doctor told her absolutely. She said her doctor told her she needed to take the COVID-19 Vaccine even if she had the plasma treatment with the COVID-19 Virus in Apr2020. Reported she planned to stay with her mother after her mother received the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t anticipate her mother having a reaction after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose because people said most reactions are happening after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said now people are reporting having reactions after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported she thought her mother&#39;s side effect after having the COVID-19 Vaccine to be unusual, since most people say it feels like they have the flu, or they are tired, or they have a headache. Reported her mother not to be able to walk wasn&#39;t that her mother was not walking, but that her mother&#39;s foot wouldn&#39;t move. She said mother not walking was either neurologic or muscular, unless that is what extreme weakness is. She said she wondered if others have experienced what her mother has. She said if her mother was experiencing just extreme weakness, the extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body, not in her upper body. She said her mother didn&#39;t have an appetite, but her mother was not too weak to put a spoon to her mouth. She said her mother couldn&#39;t move her legs, and her mother said her legs felt stiff, or almost frozen. She said if her mother had extreme weakness, and couldn&#39;t walk, what did that mean. She said if a person is really tired, the person can still move and get out of bed. She said her mother said she was really, really tired, and couldn&#39;t move. The caller said her mother said she couldn&#39;t move, and it took her mother 20 minutes to get her legs over the side of the bed. She said her mother not being able to move her legs could be extreme weakness, but observing her mother first hand, she said it looked like her mother not being able to move her legs was neurologic. She said her mother was strong in character and body, and her mother would do everything she could in her body to move, but it was like her mother&#39;s brain said &#34;go&#34;, and her body said &#34;not now&#34;. The outcome of the event Congestive cough was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 25Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for protection against virus. Medical history included COVID from 18Nov2020 and ongoing (recovering/resolving). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry: Mar2021) intramuscular in the left arm on 04Jan2021 for protection against virus with no problem. On 26Jan2021, patient had one tiny blood blister but now was covered in them. Her hands, feet, and torso are covered and are painful. The patient has trouble with ambulation and using her walker since. The palms of her hands are covered front and back too. The patient was also covered on her toes and areas of the abdomen around the umbilicus area. Had the first dose on 04Jan2021 and the second on 25Jan2021. Her mother has an appointment on 03Feb2021, and caller wanted to know if this is uncommon or a rare side effect. The reporter has found a couple of articles, but most of them refer to pediatrics and rashes and she didn&#39;t see any side effects about blood blisters for her mother&#39;s age group. Further stated that areas covered are progressively worse and disabling since her mother was using a walker to ambulate. Has not been able to really use the walker due to the soreness and tenderness of palms. Her mother had the disease (COVID) back on 18Nov2020 and was symptomatic and was mild. No other vaccines received the same time. No history of problems with vaccines in past. They can&#39;t think of nothing that was new, no new medications, lotions, creams, or detergents, nothing new. The events did not require a visit to emergency room nor a physician office. Onset date of events reported was on 26Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered. The reporter assessed the seriousness of events as disability. The events were assessed as related to vaccines.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Clinical course was reported as follows: she was just released from hospital yesterday, she took the second Pfizer COVID shot, on 12Feb2021, and became so very very ill, she expected some side effects, the first shot wasn&#39;t bad, the first all she had was a severe headache and arm hurting, but that was 3 weeks ago, and the second one she can&#39;t say how horrible it was: she had to get the paramedics there, she was very very ill. It was the worst night she has had, and she is 86 years old, and has had a multitude of serious issues but that shot was the worst. It was a combination of high blood pressure, over the top, and insomnia like she couldn&#39;t budge and open her eyes, she couldn&#39;t see anything but squares, it was like a horrible, if there is such a thing as a trip, a horrible trip, something she can&#39;t imagine wishing on anyone. The county administered it, she has several doctor, she initially provides her primary care doctor, for consent to contact, but says her nephrologist would be better, as she hasn&#39;t seen her primary care doctor in some time. Her primary care doctor doesn&#39;t know she had this, another doctor gave her permission, her nephrologist. States they were more concerned in the hospital about her kidney, she has one kidney functioning and, on mistake of the hospital, they didn&#39;t connect her to hydration, the night nurse didn&#39;t, and she was dehydrated and it was affecting her kidney. Her husband tried to call Saturday, when she had this reaction at like 06:30/07:00, but there was a huge long wait, he was calling to see about side effects, but they were beyond waiting, had to get the paramedics, her blood pressure was 178/113 and heart rate was 103. First shot was 3 weeks back. It looks like she had it on 22Jan2021, the headache and arm hurting started towards the evening, the shot was taken earlier in the day, and they started in the evening, her headache was quite severe, but with Tylenol it went away, the arm is still sore from the second vaccine, but is slightly better. Clarifies she was hospitalized for the blood pressure and delirium, like, it is best explained, like delirious: incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware, all she could see was, like if she talked about people who did LSD and trips, it was a bad trip, it was squares, she wanted to open her eyes, but could only see squares. She fell asleep Friday night about 11PM, and felt this at 04:00, and she pulled off her sleep apnea mask, she had to run to the restroom, she was weak, feeling like she would slip onto the floor, and had to get right in bed, and the insomnia continued until about 7AM, that was when she started to be able to focus on like words, she was able to say words in her mind, it was like a bad nightmare. She was admitted to the hospital, she was in the emergency room (ER), the paramedics took her there Saturday, about 07:30, took her to the hospital after immediate heart checking, an intravenous (IV) of some kind, and brought her to the hospital and she was in X-rays and what not, they did procedures in the ER, and they suggested her to be observed overnight, they watched her and things started to become more normal, but she is still not clear headed, she is woozy, like foggy. High, over the top blood pressure outcome: It has been back to a good blood pressure. Insomnia is ok- she slept ok last night. What is left: the night she woke up, so early Sunday morning, in the hospital, she was profusely sweating like someone came to her room and showered her bed with water, her sheets and blankets were soaked and this morning she woke, she got up, was still very woozy, and asked her husband to help get her out of bed, and she changed her nightgown and after an hour she got in the shower, as she was sweating again, not sweating, but occasionally on and off chills, she is taking off her nightshirt and putting on a bed jacket, she gets warm and cold, hot and cold. She had blood labs a chest X-ray, heart monitor the whole time until she was discharged, and everything was good except the kidney was extremely dehydrated. This was all on Saturday as well. On her first visit to get the vaccine, at that time, the facility was a big mall, and they handed her what to look for after the injection, and she didn&#39;t notice until this morning, it says if you have an immune system that is compromised, it could affect it, and she has immune system that is compromised diagnosed many years ago. Over the top blood pressure and insomnia had resolved, arm sore was resolving, dehydrated and affecting kidney had not resolved, final outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

We placed her in a wheelchair and she then said that her throat was closing up.  She said that it felt like someone was choking her.  A moment later, she felt like her jaws felt huge.  We quickly gave her about four or five large glasses of water  (one right after the other) and quickly took her blood pressure which went up to 170/80.  We then gave her one of her blood pressure pills.  After this, she started to finally feel better.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ET7534), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 (at the age of 86years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, blood pressure high, multiple sclerosis, and wheelchair user; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing baclofen (10mg, three times a day), metformin (750 mg, twice a day), amlodipine besilate (10mg, once a day), losartan (50 mg, once a day), magnesium (two times a day), metoprolol (50 mg, 3x/day), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B 12), and glimepiride (takes 1mg in one meal and as another meal she takes half of a mg); and Statin (unspecified) 10 mg, once a day; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine on 18Mar2021 and she did fine but an hour later when she got home, the reporter tried to help her up off of her wheelchair onto another chair and she could not stand. She had extreme weakness and then she felt like her throat was, like somebody was choking her, like their hands around her throat and then her jaw felt like it was getting huge. Then, her blood pressure went up to 170, the patient was given lots of continuous water and blood pressure pill. She started to feel better after that. The reporter further stated, &#34;She has had various different problems. I do not know if it is allergies or what from what she already has but she did have a lot of it and exhausting stuff afterwards. There is mainly that choking feeling that is frightening that she had one hour after&#34;. It was also reported that the patient developed some rash on her back and hives on her legs. It was not right away. It was kind of a day or two after. The outcome of events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts needed. Further information is expected.

An 86-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed in 1971 (reported as 50 years ago) and ongoing; type 2 diabetes in 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) which resolved in 2019 (about 2 years ago) after the patient lost some weight; she had an episode of A-Fib in 2019 when her potassium was low (lower than the current hospitalization), once the potassium was corrected, her A-Fib resolved. The physician stated that patient has shrunk and was now about 5 foot 2 inches. Clarified that this has not recently occurred since the vaccine; stated it was happening just with age. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any issues with the first dose of the vaccine. She received her second vaccine dose on 24Mar2021. The physician spoke with the patient on Friday, 26Mar2021, and the patient was fine. On Saturday, 27Mar2021, the patient had an episode of diarrhea, vomiting and was weak. The lady cleaning the patient&#39;s house found her slumped against the wall. The physician met them at the hospital and said the patient seemed okay. They thought it was just an issue from her potassium being low on Mar2021, so they gave her that. The hospital did a CT scan that showed nothing on Mar2021. The hospital did an MRI of the head that showed multiple small emboli in the brain on Mar2021. The physician believed that the patient must have thrown more clots because she became aphasic on Mar2021 and could not name things. The patient also had difficulty walking on Mar2021. The physician felt it was important to call and report this since she has heard of people throwing clots with vaccines. The physician did not know if the events were related to the vaccine. The patient was in the hospital for 7 days (as reported). She was now able to walk with some assistance. The patient&#39;s son thought that the patient was okay when he went to see her. Since the reporter was a physician, she knew which questions to ask the patient and saw that she still had some problems. The patient could remember some things but has problems with recent memories on an unspecified date in 2021. She also has some confusion on an unspecified date in 2021, such as she thought she was in a boat hospital. The physician was uncertain if the vomiting and diarrhea was somewhat better. They were wondering if the patient has some food sensitivities (2021). The patient also had carotid studies done in the hospital on Mar2021 and they were fine. They believed that patient&#39;s potassium dropped, and she went into A-Fib and threw clots on Mar2021. The clots must have come from the heart valves since the carotid studies were fine and if the clots had been in her legs, they would&#39;ve gone to her lungs not to her brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan: negative, potassium: low, carotid studies: fine, MRI of the head: multiple small emboli in brain, all on Mar2021; and potassium: low, height: 5 foot 2 inches (shrunk), and weight: lost, all on an unspecified date. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness and fall required emergency room visit. The outcome of the event difficult walking was recovering and unknown for all other events. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fall, potassium low, cerebral embolism, thrombosis, and &#34;potassium dropped and she went into A-Fib and threw clots&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and being life threatening; and the events aphasia and gait disturbance were assessed as serious due to hospitalization. All other events were non-serious. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 until 02Apr2021.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 86-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 16:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing multiple sclerosis , ongoing hypertension, ongoing diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing stent placed and spasms; and from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously had flu shot and feel a little bit sick, it hit her lot harder with the flu shot. Concomitant medication includes, unspecified, diabetic and hypertensive medication and medication for spasms. On 25Mar2021, 45 minutes to an hour after the patient&#39;s first dose, the patient felt like someone was choking her and felt like her jaw was &#34;getting large&#34; without physically getting large. The patient was not able to get out of her wheelchair, even though she was normally able to do so on her own, and her blood pressure systolically reached 170. Her mother was given &#34;excess water&#34; and was given her hypertensive medication &#34;a little early&#34; which caused her pressure to come down quickly. Based on this reaction that her mother had, caller would like to know if it was safe for the patient to receive her second dose of the vaccine. They stayed about 15 min at the drive thru to make sure there was no reaction. It was about a 30-minute drive home with traffic. It happened within the hour, right when she got in the house. The patient had a reaction to the first dose, and the caller wanted to know if it was safe for her to get the second. Within the first hour the patient felt like someone was choking her, she felt like her jaw was swelling, she felt extreme weakness and could not stand, and her blood pressure shot up. It shot up to 170, but she did not know the diastolic. The patient felt like she was choking so she was doused with water to push anything through in case that would help. Within a couple of hours, the patient started to feel better. They gave her excess fluids and gave her blood pressure medication a little bit earlier and everything came back down. She was frightened when this first occurred. The feeling of choking and the feeling of jaw swelling got better and went away within a few hours. The patient had multiple sclerosis so weakness is always an issue and mobility is always an issue. She knew her tolerance and what she could do. That day they had taken her in a wheelchair from the car to the house and she could not get out of the wheelchair, which was not normal for her. This happened within an hour of the shot. The weakness lingered the longest. That side effect did linger. It took a couple of days. She was using a Hugo again to get herself around the house and believes this extreme weakness has gone away. She was exercising on a stepper when the caller was talking to her. Caller did not believe there had been any lasting effects. Blood pressure shot up: Started within an hour of the vaccine. She had been hypertensive for quite some time historically. Her medication had been keeping it under control. They administered her dose early that day and it brought it down, it did not linger. The patient had been housebound since the pandemic started. The outcome of the event blood pressure shot up was recovering, while the outcome of the event couldn&#39;t stand was unknown; and the outcome of the rest of the events was recovered on 25Mar2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

By the 4th day, her legs would not hold her when she tried to stand getting out of bed.  She was nauseous to the point of not being able to eat or drink.  Infact, she did not have the strength or desire to eat or drink.  By the 5th day post vaccine (02/20/21), I took her to the Emergency room because she was so fatigued, she just slept, and couldn&#39;t stay awake to eat or drink.  She was able to get to the car with a walker, but that was the last time she walked.  After time at hospital and then Skilled nursing, she passed away on 03/21/21.  She never regained the ability to toilet herself, eat on her own, failed to eat and drink, and eventually was put on hospice because she lost 30 pounds over the month from failure to eat or drink, even though I was there or the nurse was there to feed her every meal, and try to get her to take fluids.  Her fatigue was just overwhelming. When she first arrived at the emergency room, she: ? Presented with 2 days of weakness and AMS; fever, nausea  and generalized fatigue ?

This 86 years old female patient received the second single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6203) on 04Mar2021 at 11:00, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were administered on the same date. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 vaccine intramuscular, on 11Feb2021 at 18:30 (lot EN6201). The patient received some years ago an unspecified pneumonia vaccine and an unspecified tetanus vaccine experiencing after both headache, swollen arm and rash. She didn&#39;t react to the flu vaccine. Her body didn&#39;t want any more vaccine. Concomitant medications were none. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, maybe a week or two after the second vaccination, early to mid afternoon, the patient had what felt like a charley horse in her lower leg while walking, but didn&#39;t pay any attention to it, just put ice on the leg. She then got sciatica in her leg on 24Apr2021 and couldn&#39;t walk; that was what sent her to the hospital as it was getting worse and she went to the hospital because of the pain. She just ignored it for at least a week but she was still having pain after the second week and could hardly walk due to the sciatica in that leg. At the hospital they found she had a blood clot in the calf of her leg on 28Apr2021. She was hospitalized from 28Apr2021 to 02May2021. The doctors in the hospital recommended that she should report her experience even though they didn&#39;t know if it was due to the COVID vaccine due to the proximity. The hospital doctors took care of her but her primary care provider knew that she had been in the hospital. The doctors gave her medications in the hospital that helped the pain in her foot and the sciatica but her lower leg/calf still hurt so they decided to do an ultrasound and found a blood clot. The patient still had to give herself injections in the belly for blood thinner to treat the blood clot. The patient also experienced soreness in arm on an unspecified date in 2021. Sciatica required ER visit. Blood clot was resolving. The other events outcome was unknown. The doctor said that there was a possibility that the blood clot could be related to the COVID vaccine, but it may not be related at all.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, including a prolonged onset latency of nearly two months, it appears unlikely that BNT162B2 contributed to the reported events. These are likely intercurrent medical conditions in this elderly patient. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) :PFIZER INC-2021501847 same patient/drug, different vaccine dose/AE

                                                The day after the first shot, my mother had bad knee pain in her left knee. It went on for days/week. After the second dose, days out she started feel very tired and bad pain in her feet that went to her hands and she couldn&#39;t get out of bed or urinate properly. Her facility doctor gave her Gabepentin for the pain but it did not help. She declined over a week or so and then She was admitted into the hospital for dehydration (March 19, 2021). The put a catheter in her to get urine out and bring her kidney function back to her normal (she does have kidney disease). Gave her more Gabepentin (which does not help pain in feet an hands) and released her to rehab. and she is now on oxygen.  Rehab was bad so I got her out and released to her facility so she could receive rehab there. She declined again with the same reaction: extreme fatigue, can&#39;t walk and now urinates and defecates in an adult diaper and now breathing is very labored.  She was admitted to the hospital and they can&#39;t find out why she is in this way. They did blood work, tests, scan and X-rays without any answers. They switched up meds on her and then released her to rehab since she hasn&#39;t walked in weeks/month at this point. She is regaining strength but now on oxygen even when sitting. She is 86 and walked with a walker all around her facility and when going to doctor appointments. Now she is in a wheelchair for doctor appointments since she has no strength and needs oxygen to walk. Her facility saw her decline after the second shot and my mom is very vocal and each day told them how she felt awful and it is because of the shot. She still has neuropathy in her feet and hands but it is not as painful as it originally was and it peaked and now just painful about a 5-6 on a scale of 0-10.

Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number EK4176) on 27Jan2021 received in one of her arms for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe pain in her left knee. The patient received the second vaccine on 17Feb2021. A week out or so she started having pain in her feet and she was very fatigued 19Mar2021; both still ongoing, both on a week. The patient had had 2 stints at the hospital, and 2 rehabs. Both of these have very slightly improved. The patient went to the hospital due to the pain in her feet that moved up to her hands, she was very fatigued, and she couldn&#39;t walk; she was bedridden on 19Mar2021. Weeks after the shot it continued day after day after day up until 19Mar2021 where she was admitted to the hospital. The patient just had her last stint in rehab this past 2 weeks and could get up with physical therapy. Hospitalization was from 19Mar2021 to 27Mar2021.

In the hospital they could not find anything seriously wrong with her. The patient had total fatigue and the caller begged them to give her mother a (vitamin) B12 shot. They gave it to her but there was no improvement with patient&#39;s energy. They put a catheter in her to get her kidney function back to her normal level. It was because she was not urinating properly. They ran a bunch of tests and there was not anything wrong with her. They did cardiac tests, lung tests, and XRays. The patient&#39;s breathing was labored. Started sometime after the second shot leading up to the hospital and that the patient had to be on oxygen. She said she was still on oxygen and that the labored breathing was ongoing, persisting. Reporter said all of these above listed were from 25Apr2021 to 03May2021.

The patient was on oxygen 24/7, all day when she was walking, sitting in a room in her wheelchair. The caller said she was hoping patient could get up and walk around but she was still weak. She said with time she hoped she got better on feet, got back to her normal. The outcome of the events were not resolved. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 87-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: E1 1283), via an unspecified route of administration injected into right arm on 12Jan2021 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history included vertigo (she hasn&#39;t had vertigo in the last ten years, she did not remember when the first time had it, it was years ago), congestive heart failure (CHF, diagnosed a little over a year ago), diabetes (diagnosed about 10-15 years ago, her A1C is always good, she has good control over that), and she got a pneumonia thing but not recently in the last 6-8 weeks. No further details provided about unspecified pneumonia thing. There was no concomitant medications, also she has no other recent vaccinations or started no new medications. Patient reported that she had been having challenges with her blood pressure going up after receiving first Pfizer COVID vaccination. Her appointment of 1st dose was at 13:45, she probably got it close to 14:00, she was out of there by 14:15-14:30. Patient reported that ever since she had the shot, her blood pressure continued to go up, so she would like to ask if she should get a second dose. She takes her blood pressure every morning since she was diagnosed with CHF and they advised her to take that every day and weigh herself to make sure she is not getting fluid build up. Patient said that on 16Jan2021 when her blood pressure was 169/91 she woke up very dizzy and thought she was coming down with a vertigo attack, which she usually has had in the past that when she had attacks her blood pressure doesn&#39;t go up, so she realized her pressure was causing her to feel dizzy. She took it later on in the day and it was 157/84. She looked back and every day it had gone up, and it fluctuated. She says on the time of reporting (on the 25th), it was 160/90. She is scheduled/due to get her second dose of the vaccine on 02Feb2021, and she could contact her doctor for her question. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: 136/69 on 30Dec2020, 134/86 on 31Dec2020, 132/76 on 02Jan2021, 138/73 on 04Jan2021, 133/68 on 10Jan2021, 142/72 on 11Jan2021, 149/75 on 12Jan2021, 150/81 on 13Jan2021, 156/86 on 14Jan2021, 146/77 on 15Jan2021, 169/91 on 16Jan2021, 157/84 on 16Jan2021, 160/90 on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She seemed unable to control her legs and feet and was unable to sit up unassisted. She was admitted to the hospital on February 11, about 36 hours after receiving the vaccine. She had elevated levels of troponin, but all other cardiac tests came back normal. She had no other abnormal test results. Today, February 13, is the first day she has been able to walk a few steps and sit up without assistance.

                                                Patient reported dizziness and a fainting episode the morning after her immunization. She knew she was getting dizzy and she attempted to get into her recliner, but fell into her recliner and injured her rib and possibly her &#39;tailbone&#39;. She went to the Emergency Department  where she was examined and scans were taken of her ribs. She was determined to have &#39;bruised&#39; ribs and sent home with advice to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen alternately every 4 hours for pain relief. She has been at home since this episode. We only found out about this adverse event this week when we called her to confirm her second immunization. She reported this fall to us and was reluctant to get the second shot. I reported the event to her provider, and now to you at VAERS.

An 87-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 01Feb2021 14:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure abnormal, glaucoma, thyroid problems, mild cognitive impairment and memory problem. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin and carvedilol for blood pressure, donepezil for mild cognitive impairment, ezetimibe, levothyroxine for thyroid problems and ongoing latanoprost for glaucoma. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL3246) on 11Jan2021 for covid-19 immunization. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient had fallen, did not hit her head, but she has extreme fatigue, memory loss (she has seen some improvement now) unable to be by herself now and take her medications. The patient had a mild case of memory loss and had delirium. The reporter cannot say these events occurred from the vaccine of course. However, the work up that has been done has been negative and reporter was worried. It was reported that the patient had a little memory problem prior to getting the vaccine, however, now it was worse. It was like the patient cannot be alone now. The patient did not have a stroke. However, this like sent the patient over a cliff. This is a life changing event. If patient gets better it&#39;s all good, but if she does not they are in big trouble. Patient was previously able to care for self and now she was not able too. Patient underwent lab test (unknown result) in Feb2021. Patient was taken to Urgent Care, was seen by a physician and basic blood work was done and a urine test was done (unknown result). The outcome of event delirium was recovering; all other events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch has been requested.

I didn&#39;t think it could be related to the vaccine as it was so soon, and only in the one place.  It had lasted until now and I&#39;ve had three physical therapy visits so far, though it is not as bad, but it&#39;s over three weeks.  I didn&#39;t think it could be related until my doctor&#39;s office said they had four cases of the exact same thing, and in younger people. (20&#39;s and 30&#39;s).  At first, the PT said it was due to a pulled muscle, though I had done nothing at all to account for that.

She woke up around 5:00 AM and was a little light headed, but as the day went on she found herself holding onto the wall and then had to get her cane.  She does have Meniere&#39;s disease.  She had a sick stomach, not nausea.  Some days were a little better than others.  She got up slower, and that didn&#39;t help that situation.  She called her doctor and told them how she was feeling, and she was asked if she wanted to come into the office, and she declined.  Then a few days went by and she did not feel any better.  She reached out to her family and they told her to call somebody and that&#39;s when she read her paperwork and called us.

                                                Patient received the injection on May 2nd.  Following the injection, we noticed an increased weakness and general achiness.  On the  8th she was so weak that we purchased a gait belt to assist her.  We were not super concerned as we were expecting the second shot to cause body aches or flu like symptoms based on what we had heard from others who had received both vaccine shots.  She continued to be unsteady and we found that she has a mild UTI which we had begun treating with prescribed antibiotics. Late afternoon on the 11th, mother suffered a major stroke.  we did not take her to the hospital because we had already been told that they would not be able to do anything at her age should she suffer a stroke.  On the 12th I called the doctors office and asked for them to send Hospice to the house as we could tell that she was dying.  Mother died on the 13th.    Just a week prior to her death I had spoken with Dr. and we had discussed how that she was declining in health but that she was not even close to needing Hospice, yet she is dead a week later.  Less than 2 weeks after getting her second Covid Shot.

On 22Feb2021 she was prescribed cyclobenzaprine and tramadol as pain medication. Before she took any of the cyclobenzaprine or tramadol on the night of 22Feb2021 her legs collapsed on her. On 24Feb2021 they called the doctor and told them that she had collapsed again, and he said to stop the cyclobenzaprine and changed tramadol dose to half strength. She started being shaky. On 26Feb2021 they called the doctor back because she had the same symptoms with the addition of vomiting. They said to stop the tramadol and start taking TYLENOL. On 27Feb2021 they went back to the urgent care for the same symptoms as well as leg pain, thigh pain, hip pain, being really shaky and real weak.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: everything was ok (her bloodwork is fine) on an unspecified date, computerized tomogram (CAT scan): everything checked out just fine on 14Feb2021, Urine test: urinary tract infection on 04Feb2021  and worsened urinary tract infection on 16Feb2021.   Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with cyclobenzaprine (strength: 5mg) as a muscle relaxer and tramadol (strength: 50 mg) as pain medication both from 22Feb2021, tramadol was stopped on 26Feb2021 and TYLENOL (every 8 hrs. strength: 650 mg, Lot Number: SBA002, Expiry date: Dec2022) was started on the same date. The patient outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Dizziness; Pain in the lower extremities; pain in feet; legs hurt; Felt poorly; Blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly; Left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s sister). An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 07:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, bypass in 2010, hearing is very bad on the phone, arthritis pain, headache, and blood thinner. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included metoprolol for hypertension, quinapril for hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) for hypertension, ascorbic acid/ calcium/ minerals NOS/ retinol/ tocopheryl acetate/ vitamin B NOS/ vitamins NOS/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER), calcium carbonate (CALTRATE), atorvastatin, warfarin as blood thinner, spironolactone, and paracetamol (TYLENOL) for arthritis pain and headache; all were ongoing. The patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 vaccine on 13Jan2021 and had reactions to the vaccine or something else. That day, the patient&#39;s left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain), but that was expected, and it went away within 2 days (initially didn&#39;t report it because it was expected). Yesterday (18Jan2021), the patient experienced dizziness and pain in the lower extremities. Last night (18Jan2021; about 6 days after the injection), the patient woke up, felt poorly, and was very dizzy (feeling of dizziness), then, later on, had pain in both lower extremities. The patient took her blood pressure which was up a little but not terribly with result of 159. The patient&#39;s heart rate, temperature, and pulse oximetry were okay on 18Jan2021. She then walked to the bathroom, came back, and went back into bed. The second time she said her legs hurt but this morning she is feeling better than she was. Today (19Jan2021), the pain in feet is better, and the dizziness is gone. Pulse oximetry and temperature were okay this morning (19Jan2021). The patient was wondering if these effects could be related to the vaccine, since the dose was received 6 days ago. The patient was not sure if could possibly be related to the COVID-19 vaccine or if it was that she spent a lot of time doing paperwork on the computer yesterday (18Jan2021) and perhaps that caused some of the symptoms. The patient&#39;s sister called to ask if Pfizer has heard of any late adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccine like this patient&#39;s, 6 days later. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 04Feb2021 (day 22) and her sister asked what if it&#39;s not available. The patient&#39;s sister was concerned about interval and potentially being unable to gain access to the second dose due to supply issues. The patient recovered from &#34;Left arm where she got the injection was sore (localized pain)&#34; on 15Jan2021; and from &#34;Dizziness&#34; on 19Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the other events.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number=EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 13:15 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated at the Clinic facility. Patient age at vaccination was 88 years. No other vaccine was given within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Medical history included high blood pressure, and Hashimoto&#39;s Disease. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHYROID), fenofibrate, lisinopril, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D). On 27Jan2021 at 06:00 AM upon waking up the morning after the shot, before getting out of bed, the patient felt like the whole room and bed were spinning and moving like in an earthquake. She stayed in bed for about 15 minutes, then sat up on the edge of the bed. She was still a little lightheaded so waited a few more minutes and then the feeling went away. The patient reported this has never happened to her before. No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was reported as resolving.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

This 89-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number PFREL1283, Expiration Date 30Apr2021), via intramuscular, on 15Jan2021 (at 12:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing lymphoedema (she gets water in her legs), ongoing severe arthritis of both knee caps (she had a cortisone shot and lidocaine in her knees), and dust allergy. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine received in Jan2020 and in Oct2020 (with terrible reaction: pain in arm, numb in arm and muscle pain arm for 6 weeks). Past drug history included allergy to lidocaine (her face swelled up), and hydrocortisone (CORTISONE). She was in a wheelchair. Surgical history included 2 hip replacements. Relevant concomitant medications included drug for lymphoedema. The patient stated she started having side effects almost immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. She felt very panicky, felt very weak, felt very tired. She had like a headache. Some of the symptoms started the day she got the shot and then more symptoms arose the day after. She was very tired and was sleeping a lot the next day. She felt very like groggy. In fact, she was so groggy, she pressed the wrong button in her chair. She clarified she has lymphedema and she has to be in a lift chair to keep her legs elevated. When she needs to get up, she presses a certain button to raise and lift the chair into a sitting position. However, that day, her doorbell rang (her meals are delivered to her) and she was so groggy and confused, that she pressed the button that put her straight out into a lying position instead of a sitting position. She ended up sliding off the chair and onto the floor. She had to call for assistance (there is an emergency button she can press). She had to be lifted off the floor. She explained to them she didn&#39;t end up on the floor from walking, she slid off the chair. She was so disoriented she pressed the wrong button. She felt like she had the flu, she was cold, she had the chills. She was laying down, covered up with 2 blankets. She couldn&#39;t move. It was terrible. At the time, she slid off the chair, she had to go the bathroom. She is on a water pill which makes things worse, but she has a bedside commode close to her lift chair. When she was trying to get off the chair go to the bathroom (which is only 4 or 5 steps away from the commode), she was so disoriented, she pressed the wrong button. She has had this chair for 5 years.  She slid off the chair and ended up hitting the floor with her rear end. She remained on the nice cold floor (its a ceramic tile floor) until they came to pick her up. She mentioned she has had 2 hip replacements and once she is on the floor, she can&#39;t get up. Once assistance from where she lives came to pick her up, she was asked if she need to go the hospital or call ambulance. She explained to them she didn&#39;t fall. She slid off the chair. She is a very active person. Although she is almost 90, year is not senile. She slid off the chair, she didn&#39;t fall. The patient stated that she got the flu shot this past October and had a terrible reaction to that, too. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her system. She has had a flu shot every single year for the past 10-15 years and she has never had a reaction at all. She received the regular flu shot at her doctor&#39;s office in Oct2020 had a terrible reaction, she had severe pain in her arm where they gave her the shot, the pain wasn&#39;t at the injection site, the shot was high up the arm, her arm was numb and she couldn&#39;t raise it; she had muscle problems with the arm, she had trouble with her arm for 6 weeks. She has been taking naproxen sodium (ALEVE) for the headache. She has just been treating it symptomatically. No fever and she has just felt cold. The patient stated she really is not sick. She went to pick up dog medicine from the vet and when she leaves her facility, her temperature is always checked when she comes back. She was told her temperature was 97 something. So, she wasn&#39;t running any temperature prior to the vaccine. The patient was planned for the second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient stated her symptoms are not so severe it affects her breathing or something serious. It&#39;s just a pain in her neck to walk around with a headache. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 89-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number and expiration date unknown, first dose, intramuscular on 26Jan2021 at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included mastectomy, surgery for metaplastic carcinoma. She received 4 units of blood and reacted to the blood and itched from her head to toe and they treated her with prednisone for that. She said that the metaplastic carcinoma was 10 inches big and half of her front was removed. Other medical history and past drugs included allergic to Bactrim, Sulfa drugs, Cortisone, Zocor, Keflex, Macrodantin, Penicillin, Vicodin (took three times and thought she was going to die; coughed for a year and couldn&#39;t even sleep because she developed Pericarditis), Benazepril, Levaquin, Losartan, Niaspan (whole body turned red), Pravastatin. On 07Jan2021, she had an appointment with her doctor who first advised her not to take the vaccine because of all of her allergies but she said there is an antidote if she has a reaction so she said she could take it. She had the first dose of the vaccine on 26Jan2021 and had a bad reaction. She was very dizzy and got sick. They didn&#39;t catch it at the vaccination site because they only had the patients wait 15 minutes. Her drive home takes 10-15 minutes. She thought she couldn&#39;t drive home because of the dizziness. She got a tightness in her chest and started getting so dizzy that she ran into the living room and slept on the sofa because she couldn&#39;t handle it anymore. It was reported that she passed out from about 12:00-15:00. She was completely out. She took a Tylenol right after the shot for dizziness and sick because when she told her healthcare professional about the symptoms, she said to take a Tylenol. She also had shortness of breath on 27Jan2021. This morning (28Jan2021) she had a headache but she was feeling much better. The caller asked if she should get the second dose due to her reaction. The patient stated she has a whole list of allergies that she gave the other agent. The patient stated that she doesn&#39;t think she will take the second shot. She also stated she takes Tylenol after the Flu shot so she doesn&#39;t get so sick. The patient mentioned that her physician does not know about any of this and said that she received the vaccine at a hospital. She said that she only contacted her doctor to notify her that she was dizzy. She was directed to take Tylenol. She said that she did take Tylenol as directed by the people administering the vaccines too and she did get sick. The patient said that it helped a little and she knows that it was not the Tylenol that caused this. She does not want to get the second shot if she gets sick like this. The patient said that the fact sheet said to call 911. The shot did not hurt her at all, and she did not know that she even received it. She said that the person who administered the vaccine was very good. The outcome of the event headache was recovering, dizziness, shortness of breath recovered on 27Jan2021, Tightness in her chest, passed out was recovered on 26Jan2021 and sick was unknown.

He called 911 and the firemen helped me sit up.  I was cold and clammy, but could talk and answer all questions.  The firemen said I should be all right and they left.  They said they had had extra calls for the same symptoms.  I went to bed, and my blood pressure was 93/53.  I slept all right.  The next day, yesterday, I was tired but feeling all right with the highest temp of 98.4.  Today, February 25, I am doing better.  I called and left a message for Dr.
