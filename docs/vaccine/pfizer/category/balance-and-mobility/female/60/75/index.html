                                                No symptoms or pain with initial injection.  I came home about 2 hours after the injection and took one 200mg ibuprofen and one 500mg acetaminophen and put an ice pack on the site briefly.  Later that afternoon I developed pain at the injection site that progressively got worse over the course of the evening so bad that I could not raise my left arm of touch the site.  I put an ice pack on again and that night I slept with a heating pad on.  I would rate the pain 8/10.  When I woke the next day the pain was still there, but not as severe.  I got in the shower and let the hot water beat on the injection site and that seems to help a lot.  The pain gradually lessened over the course of the day to a 2/10.  By the following day (3rd day post injection) the pain had completely subsided.  There was no redness or swelling at the site and I did not have any other symptoms other than the intense injection site pain.

The pain in my arm woke me up. I never felt like I fell asleep. I woke up at 530am and took my Thyroid medicine and went back to bed until 6:30am. Felt fine until about 830am. I noticed I was starting to feel lightheaded and had this pressure on my head. I went back to bed and tried to fall asleep but really never did. I noticed that I would lose track of my train of thought often. Got up at 11am and  took a shower and still just didn&#39;t feel like I had any motivation to do anything, so rested again. I then noticed my face, ear lopes and cheeks felt a little numb. I would pinch them and I noticed they were numb. Also, there was still pressure on the back of my head and on the bridge of my nose. Still light headed. I layed in bed until about 3pm when I did notice the numbness going away and the pressure on the back of my head and on the bridge of my nose getting a little better. Also, no appetite.

A 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on the arm left on 05Jan2021 around 12:00 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient used to get legs cramps when she was pregnant with her twins, but it was only one leg. The patient stated she delivered six children, was in car accidents, and had surgeries. And the patient stated the pain from the COVID-19 Vaccine was beyond any other pain she has experienced. The patient needed glasses to read patient card. And stated her eyesight was going. The patient was pretty healthy. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. And the patient did not receive additional vaccines on same date that administered BNT162B2. The patient experienced deaf and couldn&#39;t hear on 06Jan2021 09:00, leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out on 05Jan2021 19:00, dizzy on 05Jan2021, nauseous on 05Jan2021, threw up twice on 05Jan2021, things started looking funny on 06Jan2021 09:00, pain through whole body and tremoring on 06Jan2021 10:00, bruise at injection site on Jan2021. All the events (except for event bruise at injection site) were reported as seriousness as life threatening. Clinical course: the patient worked nightshift. Laid down that afternoon to take a nap and got up around 10:00. Around 05Jan2021 19:00 PM had sever leg cramps in both legs where her toes were curled out. Leg cramps after vaccine wouldn&#39;t go away and it was in both legs. Just wouldn&#39;t go away. Around 05Jan2021 21:00 PM it went away. The patient was dizzy, nauseous, and threw up twice on the night of 05Jan2021, and going into 06Jan2021. The patient went to the couch in the hotel room and started going deaf. She couldn&#39;t hear anything on 06Jan2021 around 09: 00 AM. Things started looking funny on 06Jan2021 around 09: 00 AM. Woke up at 09:35. Hour after that there was pain through her whole body and everything was hurting at 10:00 AM on 06Jan2021. The patient was tremoring at 10:00 AM on 06Jan2021. Couldn&#39;t reach the phone to dial 9-11. Thought she was going to die. Last until about noon and then started to go away. Doesn&#39;t know if it is safe to take the second vaccine. Doesn&#39;t know if these are thing that should have happened to her. She started to get real concerned. Went into hotel room and started feeling dizzy again. Stopped haring things. Funny feeling in her ears. Was seeing things, got dizzy, and everything got dark. Everything lasted until 12:00 PM on 06Jan2021. Everything was good now. The patient had a bruise where injection was in Jan2021. Stated it was nothing compared to what she went through. Woke up around 10:00 AM. Then went back to sleep and got up around 18:00 PM. She felt fine. Her whole body was sore from the muscle spasming. The outcome of the event bruise at injection site was unknown, of the event leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out was recovered around 05Jan2021 21:00, the outcome of other remain events was recovered on 06Jan2021 12:00.  The reporter considered (method of assessment: Global Introspection) that all the events were related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: All the reported events were possibly related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship. However, it is worth noting that the 60-year-old female patient had car accidents history and had surgeries. All the events started when she worked nightshift, including leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out, nauseous, threw up twice, pain through whole body, tremoring and transient deafness. Patient did not get rest after vaccination may a risk factor to the onset of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears.

Last time she went to work after receiving the first one and today (on 12Jan2021), there was no way she could go to work. She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away. She got to sleep after she took the TYLENOL. Her back and jaw was bothering her. It felt like the flu. She had upper jaw pain and pain in her back. She didn&#39;t have a good back and just aches.

Her thighs were burning at 03:30 on 12Jan2020. It was persistent weak and burning. She can barely walk.

                                                Severe Left Leg, Hip and Lower left leg pain (Sciatic Nerve) it appears the vaccine may have irritated sciatic nerve pain.  Left left leg numbness.  Decreased mobility, difficulty sitting, walking, and even lying in bed.  Started very quickly without andy known injury.  Pain continued to worsen.  Pain even worse after second injection.  Now two weeks after second shot, the pain is going away.  It is like the nerve irritation is subsiding.  The way the irritation is subsiding makes it seem that the vaccination may have caused irritation to the nerve. After receiving 1st and continuing through the second vaccine, started having severe sciatica pain going down left hip and leg.  Left leg pain and numbness.  Thought I had done something to damage the nerve.  Hurt to sit, hurt to stand and even hurt when in bed. The pain was so severe it caused issues with any mobility.  Took Advil, Aspiring, Tylenol and nothing helped.  Received second vaccine 1/12/2021 the pain continued and even got worse.  It was to the point I couldn&#39;t even walk.  I couldn&#39;t figure out how I had damaged the nerve.  I am now thinking it was from the vaccine.  I believe the vaccine irritated the nerve.  The nerve pain is starting to go away.  Normally if you  have a sciatic nerve issue, it just doesn&#39;t go away on its own.  I know there have been reports of severe back and neck pain.  I believe it can irritate the nerves which cause severe pain.  I wanted this reported in cases others complain of similar issues.  The good thing it is improving.

Then my arm pit was swollen, hot and the swelling went down my arm.  I also had diarrhea, Nausea, slight head ache, chills, body ache with a temp of 101.5.  Went to the doctor yesterday because of my armpit swelling, hot to touch and it had a red band.  She said where they gave it  was not in a muscle.  It was given sub Q &amp; that it went into my lymph gland and leaked down my arm to swell.   Right now I just have on and off nausea , pain in my lymph glands in my arm pit.  The swelling and pain has gone down and the other symptoms have faded away.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 60-year-old female patient started to receive bnt162b2 (manufacturer unspecified), lot number: EL4238, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 21Jan2021 15:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis. Patient&#39;s known allergies are Penicillin, Peanut and Dairy. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient&#39;s whole/entire arm was killing her; she was hurting across her shoulder blades down to fingers. Her elbow and wrist were hot and she was feeling a tremble in hand which she has never had before. She later added that her joint in elbow and shoulder was now reaching down to her arm. She couldn&#39;t even wear her watch today to her work, it felt swollen, like there was liquid in it. She also can&#39;t lift her arm, move and the pain was like going into her back. The patient was taking Aleve and Advil and &#34;it doesn&#39;t take away all but it takes away enough that she can function.&#34; She also bought a topical ointment to help numb the area and she was wearing a pain patch on my back. The outcome of events was reported as &#39;not recovered&#39;. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information on the batch/lot number has been obtained.

                                                Vaccine given 2/9/21. On the afternoon of 2/12/21 I began to have joint pains in my right wrist. By 2/10/21 in the morning both elbows, knees and wrists were sore. Elbows and right knee felt warm to the touch. Nodules or red spots developed around the joints. I could barely walk or climb in and out of the car, the bed, and had a very difficult time standing up from the toilet or a low chair or couch. No fever, but did have a few chills with teeth chattering at least twice.

As the day progressed the pain increased substantially into my shoulder. It then started to hurt on the left side of my neck.  I took Tylenol before bed, 500 mg is all I can take. This pain kept me awake all night and this morning I am not able to lift my arm up or down or sideways without pain, quite a bit of pain. Today is Sunday and I do not plan to seek medical care unless it continues to worsen. I will probably talk with my medical provider tomorrow if this continues.

My body felt weird.  I had a small headache and was very tired and laid down.  I fell asleep pretty quickly.   I woke up around 2:30 am the following morning, with a greater headache.  I took tylenol  for the headache.    I took another dose of tylenol 4 hours later.   I had loose stools, fatigue and my lungs felt heavy  (cough) for approx 12 hours.      Most symptoms resolved by the following day.   A little fatigue and heaviness remains.

                                                On  the day of the shot, by Noon I could feel the vaccine moving into my throat and my  face. My throat and left cheek started to swell and turn slightly red.  I took more Benadryl and called my allergist in the afternoon. They told me I needed to get to the hospital for treatment.  At the hospital, they gave me steriods, benadryl and Pepcid in an IV.  After allowing this to work, they sent me home with a  steriod prescription for 60Mg for the next 5 days.  They asked me to follow up with my allergist if I had other issues , they also told me that I would not be able to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine.  Over the next several days, I continued to have issues with this redness that had grown over my entire face. I looked like I was totally sunburned.  I did not feel well, the redness was very hot, and I struggled with some breathing. I made an appointment on  Monday morning with my allergist, and they adjusted my allergy medicine and gave me more asteroids for 5 more days.   They advised me to use my nebulizer treatments as needed to remove the heaviness in my chest. This redness and swelling has moved around my body, almost as if I can see where the vaccine is at in my body.  It went from my head to my chest/back and right arm. Down to my abdomen, and then down below my knees.  In the morning, it is usually in my face and then it moves around during the day.  I can feel this fluid moving around in my body because the redness brings swelling/fluid.  This last saturday 3/6/2021 was horrible, it was in my right ear and right foot.  It was very painful and made me very dizzy. I struggled to walk.  Then on Sunday morning, I felt fine all day.  Today Monday, it feels like it is in my right foot again, but I feel like It is  getting better.

Went to doctor and had MRI done.      Then by early February started having insomnia, hard time falling asleep and staying asleep . I feel the second dose of vaccine might have caused my immune system to become over active.  The back is now ok after rest and physical therapy but the insomnia still persist.

Woke up at 7:05 am Sunday, March 7 with dizziness, nausea and sweats that would last about a minute.  Remained  sitting still with my eyes closed about 3 hours and then eyes could be open but could not move without the dizziness and subsequent nausea. I did not vomit. My temperature was-low in the morning but climbed just to 99.3 Sunday. By Sunday afternoon, I no longer had the short sweats but remained dizzy and nauseous mostly upon any movement. I went to sleep at 11:00 pm Sunday night with the slight 99 fever. Woke Monday , March 8 much improved  from the dizziness and temperature 98.6., but felt extreme tiredness. I did not go tot work Tuesday and rested on the couch most of the day-temperature 98.6.

Itchy red spots all over head, ears and neck, some on lower part of body.  Swollen lip.  Took two benadryl at 1:45 am Wednesday .  This helped to ease the itching.  Had a headache so on Wednesday morning I took two Tylenol and made a Dr. appt.  Also was weak and faintish on Wednesday when I got up.   Dr&#39;s said to keep taking anti-histamines and report to ER if tongue or throat starts to swell.

The tingling/numbness lasted about 10 hours and gradually diminished from my feet up to my head.  About 2 hours after the tingling/numbness started I felt my blood pressure or blood sugar start to fluctuate up and down for about 2 hours.  I stayed in bed for this time period.  I felt light-headed and scared.  After about two hours, I felt stable enough to get out of bed and ate some food and drank some liquids.  The numbing/tingling sensation seemed concentrated around my head for hours.  I couldn?t really focus on anything.  It felt like when your foot falls asleep.  I felt as if I was having a neurological reaction because of the weird tingling numbness sensation.  It felt like my nerve endings were firing all over; like having the chills without being cold.  Although the biggest event was on 2/28, I felt the tingling ing/numbness in my arms on and off for at least another week.  I?m scared to get the 2nd dose.

I also started shaking uncontrollably particularly hands and arms. Vaccine administrator was immediately notified and they summoned the closest EMT. Emergency Services took my BO and pulse oximeter. A few minutes after the start of the symptoms. They explained that since  my HR was at 84, BP was 110/68 and oxygen saturation was at 98% and I wasn&#39;t having difficulty breathing that I was not having an allergic reaction to the vaccine but a parasympathetic response instead. They sat with me until the shaking stopped approximately 15minutes later.

Event details: The patient had the second COVID vaccine on 04Feb2021. Was fine that day. Had heaviness in her arm and little bit of headache. Was fine the day of the shot. 04Feb2021, felt a little heavy in the arm where she got the COVID shot. Received COVID vaccine in left arm. Drove home and was fine. Sat down and watched TV and had a frontal headache. Took Tylenol. By the time she went to bed, around 10:00 PM, her neck was so sore to turn from side to side. On top of her arms where shoulder pads would be is there the heaviness was. Both arms became sore. It was manageable and she took Tylenol. Eventually it went away. Friday morning 05Feb2021 when she got up, got to the point where she got out of bed and couldn&#39;t get up. There was no possible way for her to get up. Her husband had to buy her a 3-in-1 potty chair so she could just stand and pivot, seriousness was provided as disabling, could understand hospitalization, but confirmed she never went to the hospital. Could not rest that day or go back to the bathroom. Didn&#39;t walk anywhere. Was in a chair that she could sleep in. Husband bought her a potty chair. Was able to use the lift on the lift chair later that afternoon. Definitely debilitating. Sister who was an orthopedist nurse had to help her and secured she wouldn&#39;t fall.

The outcome of events could stand, couldn&#39;t walk, heaviness and soreness in arms was resolved on 06Feb2021, outcome of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, due to close temporal association, a possible contribution roe of bnt162b2 to the onset of &#34;unable to walk&#34; cannot be excluded.

Got up about 4:30 am to use bathroom, felt lightheaded and blacked out and apparently hit my head on something.   Realized ears were closing up and had soreness in chest that made deep breath&#39;s difficult. Called 911 and nursing line and decided to go to Emergency Dept. Did CT scan for bumps on head and IV and gave me epinephrine and Pepcid.  Was discharged with prescription for Epi Pen, Zyrtec, and  Pepcid.  Still have rash and hives but not as extensive, comes and goes.

                                                8.5 hours after vaccine injection, I suddenly began experiencing fatigue and extreme joint and muscle soreness.   Initially I noticed my knees hurting with radiating pain up into my thighs.  My head hurt, particularly at the back of my skull, near my neck.  My neck muscles were sore, as were BOTH shoulders - my right shoulder (injection site) was only slightly sorer than my left shoulder.  I called a 24/7 nurse associated with insurance company to ask if ibuprofen or tylenol were acceptable treatments for my symptoms.  She told me I could take either and alternate if I felt I needed to maximize relief.  I noticed the joins in my toes and fingers were hurting.  It was frightening to experience tightness in my chest and back muscles.  I never felt like my lungs were compromised, there was just a heaviness as the muscles seemed constricted.  I felt a slight rise in my heart rate and experienced a few palpitations mostly because I kept pondering how much worse my symptoms could get.  I was a little cold, so I decided to go to bed after drinking extra water (also a suggestion from the nurse).  I slept for a few hours 10:00 PM - 4:00 AM then got up and called an advise nurse to report that my joint and muscle pain were not subsiding.  She encouraged water and more painkiller.  As the day wore on, I felt less achy and more shaky/jittery.  My thinking was somewhat unclear - I felt a little dizzy, out of balance, off-kilter and brain &#34;foggy.&#34;  As I write this 36 hours after my injection, my symptoms are subsiding.  Where I felt a little chilled during our cool and rainy afternoon, I now feel a wave of heat sort of traveling through my body.  It isn&#39;t a fever - just an odd sensation that something is still going on.

                                                By eight pm my left arm started hurting. At 2:30 am Sunday morning it was hurting so bad it woke me up. I could not raise my arm up past 6 inches. My left arm and side down to my waist was hurting. I took some Ibruprofen. Used a heating pad on my shoulder. Finally got back to sleep for a few hours. When I woke around 7:30 am, most of the pain had moved under my arm and to the front of my shoulder. I sat in my hot tub (100 degrees) for an hour and took more Ibruprofen. I was able to raise my arm up about half way. Was very tired. Went back to bed around 10 am and slept until 2:30. Had a headache and fatigue. Napped off and on the rest of the day. Today I can raise my arm all the way up, slowly. It is still painful to do so. The headache and fatigue are minimal.

Pain to the back of my neck, a flush of warmth to my upper body and difficulty breathing.  Felt like a truck ran over my chest.  I was weak, dizzy and nauseous as well.  The tingling sensation also affected both my legs. The RN took to their infirmary area and began taking my vitals.  Vitals seems normal, Blood Pressure and Pulse were high.  I am asthmatic but did not bring my inhaler with me.  Because of my difficulty breathing, they decided to inject me with Benadryl which is all they had.  After about twenty minutes, my breathing started to calm down and blood pressure began coming down as well.

                                                Patient was walking to the bathroom when she became dizzy.

                                                Within 1 hour after receiving  vaccine, approx 45 min., Both ears suddenly felt as if I was on a plane and was blocked as you would feel by altitude change.  I kept trying unblock by swallowing etc.  That last 15ish minutes followed by a constant sound in both ears as if someone was rubbing sand paper back and forth in front of each year.  That lasted 40-50 minutes.  Approximately 32 hours after feel like I have to keep swallowing to unblock my ears.  That altitude flucuation again feeling but not as bad as the first encounter.  This was related to the vaccine.  No doubt in my mine.  Never had anything like this before unless on an airplane.  Sand paper sound, never.   I let my physician know tonight via email.  In addition I felt dizzy within 5 minutes of receiving the injection.  Subsided within 15 -20 minutes.  Felt aloof the remainder of the day.  Also arm hurt so bad the next day I had to cancel golf.   Low grade fever plus headache

When I got home, I had difficulty getting out of my car.  I  sat in a chair and within the next few minutes I was not able to stand. My husband had to come help me get up and stand, there was pain across my lower back like pin needles and up part of my spine. I took Motrin and it helped it subside somewhat not much.  The second day it continued but later started to ease a little but I was not able to walk upright.  Third day, 3/24,  it is starting to ease up and I am able to walk upright, there is still discomfort.   I have contacted my physician to report the issue.

This pain also make it difficult to sleep through the night.

Solicited report from a consumer of a 60 year old female with events of heart/atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, eye surgery and arm surgery and non-serious weight gain due to attempting to stop smoking, lower  back issues, felt fuzzy, got first dosage of covid-19 vaccine and experienced sore arm, fatigue and dizzy from  the blood thinners after surgery, still not feeling as much energy as before and walk about a block but then starts to hurt with humira 40mg/0.4ml (adalimumab). The patient had a relevant medical history of tobacco use/four cigarette sticks per day, seropositive high titer rheumatoid arthritis, fingers swelling, joint pain, joint swelling and lost of blood flow in hands and legs. On unknown dates, the patient experienced eye surgery, arm surgery, lower back issues, felt fuzzy, got first dosage of covid-19 vaccine and experienced sore arm, fatigue and dizzy from the blood thinners after surgery, still not feeling as much energy as before and walk about a block but then starts to hurt. In 2020, the patient experienced heart/atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. In Sep2020, the patient experienced weight gain due to attempting to stop smoking. On 24Feb2021, the heart/atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation resolved. Covid-19 vaccine was also considered suspect. The patient had eye and arm surgery in the past. On 24Feb2021, she underwent pulmonary vein cryoballoon ablation surgery for the atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. She had a procedure done and went into her heart and froze the nerve endings that were causing the atrial fibrillation, and also fixed the flutter in her heart. The causality as per reporter for this procedure was reported as no reasonable possibility. She still recovering. She discontinued the Humira two weeks before the surgery and took her last injection on 10Feb2021 and was paused it for four weeks, but she started back it on 10Mar2021. She follows up with her surgeon at the end of the month and she hopes this helps got her off of the blood thinners and other medicines, she been on for this. She stated that this was not related Humira. She was advised by her physician to increase the exercise to lose some weight. With her lower back issues, she was hoping that when she got off of the blood thinners, she could do pain shots again and start exercise. She could walk about a block but then she started to hurt. She had been careful with her diet also, cut out the salt also. This had nothing to do with Humira and she did not want to be contacted about this again for this also. She felt fuzzy, it took her most of the morning to get woken up. Her Doctor thinks once she would off of the blood thinners she would be back to normal. Other than that she feels fine. She does not wanted to be contacted about this. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. On unknown date, patient received first dose COVID-19 Vaccine manufactured by Pfizer, lot number unknown. She agreed to have physician contacted. Blood thinner was also considered as co-suspect.  Other medical history included abstains from alcohol, contrast dyes allergy manifested by scratch throat, allergy manifested by bowel movements (oral medications for rheumatoid arthritis; up to eight times a day and slept 15 hours per), prevent esophagus damage, heart, low thyroid, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

A 61-year-old female patient received 1 dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686) via unspecified route on left arm single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 02Jan2021, 02:30 PM, at 61-year-old. Medical history: allergies to sulfa, paclitaxel (TAXOL); breast cancer in 2003 and 2007. Prior to vaccination, the patient did not be diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication in two weeks included: escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO, strength: 10m); omeprazole; multivitamin; ibuprofen. About 5 minutes after the vaccine (02Jan2021, 02:35 PM), the patient had a strong wave of burning sensation growing inside the body, lightheadedness, blood pressure went up, heart rate went up, hands freezing, mild difficulty with thought/speech/concentration, weakness, mildly shaky, anxiety, feeling that may pass out. Emergency room/department or urgent care visited. Treatment received for the adverse event included: heart rate H20 and BP monitor, water, observation. Since the vaccination, the patient did not have been tested for COVID-19. Action taken for BNT162B2 was not applicable. Outcome of the events was resolving. It was reported as non-serious per the reporter.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Mental impairment cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 30 minutes after taking the vaccine, when I was driving home, my face got very hot and red. I also started feeling lightheaded like I might faint. I pull over into a parking lot and had a family member come get me to drive me home. I was extremely thirsty and drank a lot of water at home. Eventually, my redness went away and my face did not feel as hot.  I did feel other more typical symptoms too such as painful arm, and flu like symptoms. I am mainly concerned about the reaction I had when driving home since it was similar to what happens when I take cortisone or Doxycycline.  I am needing information as to whether it is safe for me to take my second dose of the covid vaccine.

I fell forward and sustained bruising to my right cheek and temple.  I will be reporting another report regarding the second dose with adverse reaction that is the same but required EMS and Emergency Room visit. Approximately 3 hours after injection I was getting ready for bed (as I work nights). I was talking with my daughter and I stood up and remember waking up on the floor. Bruising to the right cheek and temple. I did not seek medical attention and went to bed. I had no further episode but remained dizzy for several days.

                                                I had an immediate reaction to the covid vaccine within 30 seconds after the injection.  I felt a warm sensation after the vaccine in my deltoid muscle then felt it go up both my ears, around my head.  I then felt the same warm sensation in my abdomen, followed by buzzing of my entire body with light headedness.  I could breath, I could talk, but I had an urgency for others around me to know that I wasn?t feeling well and something was not right.  I asked my colleagues if someone could take me to the ER for monitoring.  They immediately put me in a recliner and elevated my legs.  This did not relieve my symptoms and asked to go to the ER.  I got to the ER and laid on the stretcher with continued increased buzzing sensation especially in my finger tips and arms.  My vital signs were 148/88 and HR 88 (elevated from my normal of 100-120/60-70, HR 60s).  The buzzing turned into a sensation in my arms that rumbled erratically.  I thought something bad was about to happen and that my blood cells would burst. Then I also felt icy cold in my arms and my gut.  Next what happened were teeth chattering shivers.  All these symptoms occurred in a matter of minutes.  They started an IV, drew blood, gave me Benadryl and ran IV fluids.  My vitals did not reflect what I felt inside, but as symptoms let up, my VS returned to normal.  As quickly as the symptoms started, they eventually calmed down and I was able to leave the ER in 1.5 hours to go home. I was very scared.  The ER doctor thought I had a hyperimmune response to the vaccine.

                                                Slightly sore left deltoid, cleared up in a few days.  16 hours after shot, experienced the dramatic sensation of tilting while sitting on a couch.  Had I been driving, this would likely have caused an accident.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this feeling.  There were 2 or 3 other episodes of feeling like I was falling.  2 of this happened while lying down.  They were sudden sensations that made me gasp.  Spent most of 1 week in bed with fatigue, vertigo, and 2 times vomiting.  Vomiting occurred day 2 post vaccine.  Fatigue was continuous for about a week.  At day 16 now, certain movements still illicit vertigo.  All vertigo symptoms have lasted under 1 minute. However, some have been back to back, such as after repositioning multiple times in bed.  Ears have felt very full for almost 2 weeks.  Certain head positions or movements, still illicit sensations of the room moving.  There was no specific headache, but my head did not feel good for about 2 weeks.  There was no fever, but there was chilling one night, a couple of days after the vaccine.  I don&#39;t know if getting 2nd vaccine is wise.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140 and Expiration Date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the right deltoid on 27Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  Concomitant medications included progesterone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), estradiol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), testosterone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); all taken for hormonal treatment from an unspecified date to an unspecified date.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: some extreme fatigue (non-serious) on 27Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, nausea (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, dizziness/lightheaded (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, vertigo (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, felt very uncomfortable (non-serious) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, mental fogginess (non-serious) on an unspecified date with outcome of not recovered. The patient stated she wanted to report her experience with the first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine (COVID Vaccine), which was received on 27Dec2020. The patient stated she experienced some extreme fatigue starting that first day and then about four days later on 31Dec (not clarified), she experienced some nausea, some dizziness that advanced to vertigo and that occurred late at night; at the time she was getting ready for bed time around 22:00, but it just lasted for about one hour.  The patient &#34;went to bed just thinking about and staying in bed and then I felt very uncomfortable and I got up and then I went back to bed about at 01:30, that&#39;s how I just fell asleep.&#34; Then the next day, the patient was not feeling the vertigo, however, she was feeling lightheaded for about two days and then the fatigue continued to 08Jan (not clarified). Then starting on a Saturday, the patient &#34;felt normal myself energetic and positive.&#34; The patient was still feeling mental fogginess, &#34; I was getting here.&#34; The patient stated that dizziness and vertigo, or the mental fogginess were not listed on her list of possible side effects. The patient even asked her doctor what it would be, and the patient let her know that she received the vaccines. The events did not require any emergency room or physician office visits. The causality assessment from the reporting patient was reported as: &#34;Yes, I believe it did.&#34;

A 61-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 18Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been otherwise well prior to receiving the bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020. Within 72 hours, she experienced fatigue, body aches, chills and sweats since 21Dec2020, though she was able to work Xmas week. On 31Dec2020, she contacted her PCP to report neck and leg muscle stiffness and pain, difficulty ambulating, fatigue, chills and sweats. She had a negative COVID test on 02Jan2021 and essentially negative blood work, other than an ESR of 124 mm/hr and CRP of 4 mg/dl. I had a negative PET scan on 12Jan2021. Currently, she had pain/stiffness in her neck and legs, and progressive difficulty w/ ambulation (both of which are worst in the early hours of the AM), and difficulty with ADLs since 31Dec2020. She had been unable to work since 03Jan2021. Her physician had not indicated or endorsed any relationship between her symptoms and the vax. She forewent dose 2 out of an abundance of caution. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events muscle stiffness , neck pain and gait disturbance appeared 13 days after administration of single dose BNT162B2. The Company considers that the events are less likely related to suspect BNT162B2 injection given the weak time association. The detailed clinical course and cause of the events would be helpful for further assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She had the vaccine on Thursday (31Dec2020) and by Sunday (02Jan2021), she had a horrible headache, all the muscles in her shoulders and back were tightened up. And all the week long, she kept trying to keep care with hot packs and cold packs and Advil and Maxalt and all kind of things but could not. Yesterday morning (as reported), she lifted nothing heavy, did nothing different at all and she could not pick her head up. Patient had to seek for medical attention just at her doctor&#39;s office not at the hospital. She had to have somebody and take care of muscle pain.

Nurse further stated that she didn&#39;t do anything as a precursor before the vaccine or after the vaccine. The muscles in her neck were all tied up between her shoulder blades, and her shoulders all was shrugging and could never release the muscles back that was what she felt like. Nurse stated that she just have to take the second shot, that was just the first one. Somebody told her that she have to report it because it took her off the work for two days. And her muscles were still tight and at all the way to my neck and still have headache. She had a shot on 31Dec2020, and symptoms started on the 2nd. Patient reported that she never had such kind of pain before and her muscles never acted this way. She was advised by her healthcare provider that there were side effects and this one she consider severe. She was advised to continue to take the second one. Outcome of the events headache/could not pick my head up and all the muscles in my shoulders and my back were tightened up/muscles are still tight and at all the way to my neck were not recovered; outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                I had flu like symptoms headache and dizziness with both doses. The symptoms of the first dose stopped at day 3. After the second dose, 3 weeks later, the symptoms appeared later but held on to day 5 or 6, except the more extreme dizziness which I still have. It is worse on some days and there is some nausea in the mornings with headache. I have never had vertigo but this is what I imagine it to be.

                                                I am a teacher, so thankful to have received my vaccines.  40 years ago, as a young teacher I had a bad reaction to a flu shot and I have never had another one.  I didn&#39;t think this vaccine would be similar.  I am not someone who gets very sick often and I don&#39;t miss days of teaching for illness. Note that my first vaccine on 1/21 had no effects.  I did not even get a sore arm.  I even sort of bragged about it. The 2nd vaccine on 2/11 seemed fine until I woke up the following morning feeling like I had been hit by a truck.  I yawned for 3 hours straight, but still made it to school and worked and taught 6 online classes.  I took an ibuprofen that morning because I was feeling so odd.  By 3:00 I was driving home (40 minute drive) and I cried uncontrollably the whole way home while my hands and feet were shaking.  Not normal for me. When home I went almost immediately to bed.  I had a slight temperature and was dizzy. I thought I had the chills but it didn&#39;t feel like any chills I have had before.  Usually my teeth would chatter and I would feel hot and cold at the same time. The hottest temperature I had was 100.5.  But by 9 I started shaking so profusely that I couldn&#39;t pick up the thermometer any more, I couldn&#39;t use my phone, or take a sip of water.  I stumbled to the bathroom holding onto things all the way.  My husband was not home, or I imagine he would have called 911 at that point.  I kept shaking a lot through the night and kept praying that it wouldn&#39;t happen to my heart.  I fell asleep eventually and dreamed of fish flopping inside me and my neighbors coming over to to see why the bed was knocking against the wall.   Saturday morning I woke up and all the shaking had stopped, but I found I was too weak to get up much.  Today is Monday and I mostly feel normal, except a little dizzy when I move and the top of my head is tender to the touch.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A non-pregnant (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) 61-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, lot number: EN5318), intramuscular, first dose on 23Jan2021 09:45 at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was seated in observation area for a 30 minute observation after injection of COVID-19 vaccine on 23Jan2021 09:45.  At 10:00, after 5-10 minutes stated she had tingling to tongue and lips. Shaking noted to hands and patient stated she felt numbness to upper extremities with dizziness then felt light headed.  Patient transported to first aid room for further assessment and observation. Patient was alert and oriented (A&amp;O) x4, lungs clear to auscultation. Patient also stated she felt like she needed to take a &#34;deep breath&#34;. Patient had O2Sat of 95% on room air (RA) and blood pressure (B/p) of 130/80.  At 10:16, physician ordered to give patient 12.5mg of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) liquid oral 1 dose with 16oz of water intake during observation period. Patient was continuously monitored and noted that was able to ambulate at 10:25 to bathroom with assistance but still experiencing dizziness. Patient was monitored for a total of 45 minutes then discharged home. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at a public health clinic/veterans administration facility. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered on 23Jan2021 10:30. Case was reported as non-serious.

But the ringing in my head/ears is still going on. It?s driving me crazy. It?s a high pitch buzzing sound that never stops. At times I feel dizzy and nauseous because of it.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Blood pressure high diagnosed a couple years ago. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) for COVID-19 immunization on 29Dec2020 and unspecified flu shot last fall, she thinks in Sep or Oct2020, but she has never had problems with those. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient called and said she had reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 12 hours after her second dose and wanted to report it. She said also this past weekend, on Sunday, on 24Jan2021, she started to develop a localized rash that has like a border to it. She added that she got her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021 at about 01:30 PM in her right arm. She said that she woke up the next morning, 20Jan2021 at 03:00 AM with a high fever, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and rapid heart rate. She said that the high fever that started the temperature she took was 103 initially, she says she took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and it came down to 101, and the next day it was probably 100 most of the day, then it broke that evening. She said the Tylenol, the dose was the extra strength, unknown if it was 500 mg, they were capsules. She says she normally doesn&#39;t keep it around, the in-house nurse suggested it so she went and got a sample thing and took a couple doses, she doesn&#39;t have it with her as she is at work and is not at home. She said that the nausea and vomiting subsided after the first day or second day, she had the on and off fever and slept most of the day both days. She said that she doesn&#39;t have a fever now. She said that she doesn&#39;t have her exact heart rate from when she was having the rapid heart rate, she just felt it in her chest. She added that the only reason she said anything was because she called in sick last week on an unspecified date in Jan2021. She said that the rash started developing after that and it is now probably the size of a 16 oz or 60 oz cup, unable to clarify number with caller, she said that it is definitely big but it doesn&#39;t bother her, though she is concerned it is there. She clarified that it is a couple inches in diameter and kind of looks like the state of (State Name), on her injection arm which was her right arm. She said her arm is not sore now, it was after the shot on an unspecified date in Jan2021, if she pressed where the injection was it is still a little sore. She said that the hospital said to report it. She said she also has a concern if she should she get another shot if they decide this is needed for more than two vaccinations. She said that she knows they are still gathering information at this point, so she thought she should better turn in, hopefully there will be solution later on. The outcome of the events localized rash, dizziness, heart rate increased and sickness was unknown. The outcome of the events fever, nausea and vomiting was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021 while the outcome of the event vaccination site pain is recovering.

                                                The next day, when I woke up I was unable to stand on my left leg. Pain in the posterior knee. Felt like I was walking through mud. Joints were all loose. Just a really bad left knee pain. They  a lower extremity doppler to that leg - to look for blood clot and that was negative. Physical therapy - taped my knee; pain was so bad I had to stay home a couple of times. My hands (both) were so painful. Like I had frostbite. Occupational therapy did hand massage and paraffin for the pain. And isotoner glove at night and that helps with the buzzing. I am 2 months out today from the vaccine and I&#39;m starting to feel like normal. Took two months to fade away. It may have been because I was still having COVID antibodies. COVID antibodies on August started at 6.95. I&#39;m not totally recovered right now but I&#39;m close to normal.  Doctor visit - January 29, 2021 and February 5, 2021.and February 19th.  They put me on high dose of Steroids - 20 mgs Prednisone daily  and another round of blood thinner -ELIQUIS  mg which helped me with pain and joints.

A 61-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm shoulder (as reported) on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included high blood pressure from 2017 and ongoing, open heart surgery in Aug2017 (for 2 holes in the heart), complete heart valve replacement in Oct2017 and ongoing, &#34;pacemaker&#34; from Oct2017 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included metoprolol for thyroid condition, amlodipine for high blood pressure, clarithromycin (CLARITIN [CLARITHROMYCIN]) for allergies; all from 2017 and ongoing. Patient previously took first dose of BNT16B2 on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization and experienced heart rate increased. She was brought to the emergency room and they gave her an intravenous medication for cardioversion where they stopped her heart and restarted it to get the rhythm back to normal. Family medical history included mother and sister died from lung cancer; father died of pancreatic cancer. Heart rate increased following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine administered on 29Jan2021; onset of event was in the afternoon on 30Jan2021 while at work. Her heart kind of jumped, skipped a beat and then just took off; she could feel her body twerking. Her heart rate went up to 193 beats per minute. She went to the nurses station at work, they took her blood pressure which was 193-verified this as same number of bpm of heart rate-documented as provided. That nurse told her she should go to the hospital, so patient just left work and walked to the hospital which was a block away from work. She did not feel lightheaded, sick, or pain, just heart racing. She was again seen in the emergency room in response to this event, but was not admitted to the hospital. She was again given an intravenous medication for cardioversion where they stopped her heart and restarted it to get the rhythm back to normal. She does not know the name of the intravenous medication for cardioversion that she was administered. The only thing still ongoing related to this event was that she feels a little lightheaded still. Relevant Tests: All were good. They tested her kidneys, heart did an X-ray, EKG; tested her liver and thyroid and they said everything came back good; They said her heart rhythm was fast, and irregular, but something else was normal-she does not remember what that was. She had no further details or results for testing/investigations to provide at this time. Outcome of increased heart rate was recovered while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the batch number has been requested.

                                                On day 2, I developed confusion and could not focus making it impossible for me to complete my work at my job. The confusion made driving dangerous. By Friday, I went to my PCP and they noticed that my blood pressure was only 90/58 and they were concerned so she told me that she was calling my cardiologist who said to reduce the dose of my Diltiazem from 180 mg daily to 120 mg daily. She also said to take a few days off of taking the Diltiazem. I have also had a serious increase in Tachycardia. That evening I went to the ED because I was so weak and couldn&#39;t breath well. I am also retaining a lot of fluid. The lab work indicated an elevated Pro-B-Natriuretic Peptide level of 227. I am still not well and each doctor I have spoken to said they believe it is due to the vaccine. I do not know if I should take the second dose.

In 2 hrs., varicose vein in left thigh was extremely throbbing, I could barely walk on stiff knee.  I had a trouble night of pain on Sunday 2-28, Monday , I could barely walk on left leg  &amp; still had thigh pain, I almost fell down stairs 2x from leg buckling, I did fall down in the kitchen  and the fam. room from knee buckling, not supporting my body. I used heat, ice, rest, ibupfen, advil, tynelol, ben-gay, icyhot, CBD cream. I used it all. Today is one week and the thigh pain is gone but knee is still stiff. It no longer buckles, but I still can not fully walk. I am using a cane. I have been working from home all week, but can not cook for myself. I have to sit in a chair in the shower. I did contact my Dr., who said keep doing everything I am doing, that as long as it getting better every day. I am afraid to take 2nd dose.

                                                I felt a shooting pain immediately from my arm into my shoulder area, and then felt itching and had  a slight rash on chest area. When checked to be released, upon mentioning the rash, they checked my blood pressure, which is normally in the 90-100/68-70 range (low!) and it was 138/80.  Sounds normal, but I?ve never had a blood pressure reading that high!  I felt ok enough to leave with my husband, but later got dizzy, nauseous  and throughout the day my joints (neck, shoulders, arms and legs) got increasingly painful, to the point where I could barely climb the stairs that night without assistance.  Note: I run 5K every other day and bike or walk on off days, so I?m pretty active.  I took Tylenol and went to bed early and was stiff, but better the next morning.  Made myself get outside for a light run and was basically fine (albeit very tired) the next day.  First day was a little scary though.

The third day after shot, my fever went away and most of the body aches except I still have the headache and my arm is still hot, and swollen. Just have been taking tylenol this whole time and cold wash cloth for fever and swelling.

Concomitant medications included insulin glargine (LANTUS); metformin; hydrochlorothiazide; candesartan; glipizide (GLIPIZIDE XL) and; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) - all taken for unspecified indications with start and stop dates not reported. The patient previously received sitagliptin (JANUVIA) and experienced allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the Covid vaccine. The patient did not have Covid prior vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in a public health clinic/veterans administration facility. The patient received the Pfizer vaccine dose 1 on 02Feb2021. The patient experienced nausea, chills, diarrhea and bad chest pain could barely breathe - these have passed. Her left arm where the injection was given was very painful from the injection site to her wrist and she has been alternating ice pack/heat pad and taking Tylenol 650 mg for the pain. She can barely lift her arm over her head. She also noticed an increase in her blood sugar and her blood was really dark - she stated this was unusual. She asked if there was anything she can do or take that might decrease her arm pain. All the adverse events happened on Feb2021 and resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was reported that the patient had not recovered from all the adverse events at the time of the report. No treatment was received for all the adverse events, except for &#34;left arm where the injection was given was very painful from the injection site to her wrist&#34; (alternating ice pack/heat pad and taking Tylenol 650 mg for the pain). The patient has not been Covid-tested post vaccination.

I Waited 15 min, got in my car, and felt the need to defecate. Went back in the store, completed, got in my car to drive home.  Started to feel even dizzier but kept driving. Felt like maybe I was having a little bit of a strain swallowing but was breathing fine. I took 2 puffs of my Albuterol. Still felt unnatural and anxious. Got home and started to feel a little better within 15 minutes. The arm is sore, not too much of a bother, body aches.  Chills for a few hours. Got up and went about my day. Tired and anxious.

                                                At about exactly 12 hours after receiving the vaccine. I was sitting in my living room watching TV and a sudden severe pain shot through my chest and followed by tightness and difficulty breathing. It was immediately accompanied by a pain between the shoulder blades, cold sweat, nausea, then neck pain and faintness along with the uncontrollable need to move my bowels which was in diarrhea form and continued 3 times within 20 minutes with the other symptoms. After about 5 minutes of receiving the onset of the initial shocking pain, the intensity of the chest pain left but the tightness remained and faded but would return and then subside again every 10 minutes.  I went to the emergency room at 11:20pm discharged at 2:50am on 3/19/21.

I was very weak and at times was unable to get out of bed or stand.  I had significant joint and overall body pain, at times unable to stand up straight.  As this subsided about 36 hours I remained quite weak.  On the night of 16 March I was woken up at 1 am with a very severe headache.  I took Tylenol and 5 hours later still had the headache - it subsided after about 8 hours.    I additionally had stomach cramping but no vomiting or diarrhea, and  had no bowel movements until the episode cleared up.    During the 4 days that this occurred I tried to keep well hydrated but still had quite concentrated strong urine.  I took Tylenol periodically throughout the 4 days, not starting until after the injection was administered.  I still feel a little loss of balance/brain fog and have recurring headaches (not migranes).

She has no history of dizziness and no history of health problems.  Reports she does take Fosamax on Saturday and normally feels some nausea with that.  She did take the Fosamax on 3/13/21.  She questioned if this was a normal reaction and said it was severe enough that she did not feel she could walk to the office on the college campus.  I recommended she call her doctor and if she continued to feel severe dizziness go to Emergency Room.  I called her back at 4:54 pm on 3/16/21 and she reported she did go to the Emergency Room and they did a CT Scan and also some other tests but she could not remember everything.  She said her blood pressure was elevated while in the Emergency Room.  Was discharged and has a follow up appointment with her normal provider.   Client called on 3/18/21 at 4:46 pm and said the dizziness continued and she was started on a steroid and meclizine by her provider.

                                                I woke up at 2:30am morning of March 19, 2021 with fever, chills, severe headache, throbbing arm pain in left arm from shoulder to elbow  (injection was in left arm), and nausea.  Got up to try to get Tylenol tablets, but returned to bed because I was unsteady on my feet &amp; didn&#39;t feel like I should try to go downstairs to get the Tylenol or a thermometer to take my temperature. But my husband said I was warm to touch when he brought me extra blankets to help mitigate persistent chills I was having t/o the night.  Symptoms continued until morning of March 20, 2021 and gradually lessened by evening.   Stayed in bed all of March 19th and took Tylenol 650mg every 6 hours to lessen bad headache.  Ate a few saltine crackers to lessen nausea symptoms &amp; drank ice water.  Had a small nosebleed evening of Mar 19th that resolved with pressure to the bridge of my nose. Today (Mar 20th), I have residual light headache that goes away with Tylenol, but no fever, chills, nosebleeds or arm pain.

I was called over when she looked pale and felt dizzy a few minutes after receiving the vaccine. We took her vitals and her O2 was 98%, HR 61, and BP 92/67. Her normal BP is in the 110s. No history of syncopal episodes or diabetes. Patient then became unresponsive to questions and stared off into the distance for about 10 seconds. She never lost consciousness. She proceeded to gurgle up vomit and I called 911. She became responsive again and able to converse normally, but still felt dizzy. We wheeled her to the front, and EMS arrived. She agreed to go to the hospital due to the concern for her unresponsive episode, inability to walk on her own, and living by herself.

                                                Around 11, 11:30 the pain woke me up because it was so bad. It was hot and there was a big lump under my left arm pit (was very tender). I did not go to sleep like that. I did not have any symptoms by the time I went to bed. I also felt hot, and then cold, then hot, then cold, I would feel too hot and then too cold, freezing, I could not keep my temperature under control. I had to call in at work during the weekend I was feeling so bad. I had a lump under my armpit the size of a fist and I could not close my arm completely. It was huge and painful. I decided to go to a clinic over the weekend (unsure if Saturday or Sunday) to seek medical care and they ran some labs and a CBC to check for infection.  All results came well no infection. They suggest to keep taking Tylenol. By Monday or Tuesday I started feeling well enough to return to work. The lump was still present and took about a week to go down. The injection site also was sore for a while, about a week also like the lump.

                                                About 50 minutes after the vaccine was given, my tongue began to swell and I experienced tightness in my throat and chest and shortness of breath. (This was occurring while I was driving myself home from the vaccination site.)  I administered my Epipen.  And I then drove myself to the Emergency Room, which is near my home.  At the ER, I was injected with cortisone, Benadryl, and Pepcid, and had my heart and blood pressure monitored for about 3 hours and then I was released, with a prescription for 50MG Prednisone (1q/day) and 10MG Pepcid (2q/day) x 5 days (for both scripts).  I finished the prescriptions, but am still feeling some discomfort in my throat and some dizziness.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 05Mar2021 1:45 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the BNT162B2. Medical history included allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, brain barrier fever, epilepsy, encephalitis and meningitis. She had epilepsy as a child. She gets epilepsy when she gets sick. The last 4 times she got sick she had a seizure. The last seizure was 1 year ago (in 2020). She may have had COVID, but she got really sick and had a seizure. She is not sure if it was COVID or not. If it was the flu, she does not want that again. She had ataxia and ended up in hospital two times but did not stay. Prior to this, she did not go to hospital for 30 years. She was unable to walk, her gait was real bad. The neurological disorder messed her up for a while. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE first dose and experienced autoimmune response. After the vaccine, she had pain and tingling sensation from head to her to spine (05Mar2021), BP dropped to 70/40 (06Mar2021), seizures (06Mar2021), and delayed allergic reaction (Mar2021). She wanted to know if she should take the second dose or not. She also wanted to know if that would be considered the anaphylactic reaction. It was also reported that the patient experienced funny taste in mouth, back pain, hands tingling on 05Mar2021. The patient further explained that when she got the shot, she had a funny taste in her mouth. It started immediately after she got the vaccine and it lasted 30 minutes. She mentioned this to the people at the facility, but they said she was crazy and no one else has mentioned this. She thought they would be interested, but they did not care. About 20 minutes later she had a tingly sensation. It was in the back of her head that developed into a stingy, painful, heat, funny type feeling. It was all the way down to her back. She later further explained the back of her head was tingling (05Mar2021). Like were the cerebellum is to spine. This sensation is still there, but better. After she felt this feeling her back then started hurting. She bent over and her back went out. She felt achy. She already had what she called a tweaky muscle (05Mar2021). She had pulled a muscle in her back, but it was nothing that had caused a problem. After getting the COVID vaccine it triggered an immune response in her body. She started to have pain at the top of her head down to her hip (05Mar2021). She bent over and she could not stand up (05Mar2021). Her husband had to help her put her pants on and sit down due to this. She started to have horrible back pain (05Mar2021). She could hardly move (05Mar2021). She was having trouble walking (05Mar2021). She was having trouble holding her urine (05Mar2021). On Saturday evening (06Mar2021), her blood pressure started dropping and she later had a seizure. After the seizure occurred it seems like everything got better and she did not have any trouble since. It was very scary. She mentioned she was in the bathroom and there was a tub full of water. She had a hard time already getting to the bathroom. She was in a lot of pain. The amount of pain she had she thinks affected her blood pressure. She had pain in the back, middle of her back. It started at her head, back of head, down her spine, came down to her back and hips. She was hurting a lot and having a terribly hard time getting around. She could hardly walk. She was going to the bathroom because she felt like she had to go. Her husband was helping her sit on the toilet. When she stood up it was like her blood pressure dropped, she almost went headfirst in the tub full of water, but her husband caught her, laid her down, and had a seizure. This was a very unnerving feeling. The seizure did not last more than a minute, maybe two at the very most. The seizure occurred probably around 6PM or 7PM. It did not last long at all. She woke up on the floor. She had been sitting and she thought she had fallen off the toilet. However, her husband had to remind her that a few things happened in between. She almost fell in the bathtub and she has glass doors. She mentioned she felt as clarified and confirmed sped up. She did fall into a cabinet and is bruised up from that seizure (06Mar2021). She is sore from the pain from that. Still inflamed (06Mar2021) possibly due to the seizure. Like she has ruminants of what occurred to back of head, cerebellum. Before she had the seizure, her blood pressure had started dropping. It started dropping in the evening around 5PM or 5:30PM. Mentioned she is a little confused about the time onset because she was hurting so much and bad all day. She does not take any pain medication. She has an autoimmune disease and it is difficult for her to take medications. On top of that, if she wanted to take an Aspirin she was told she should not take one. She was informed she was trying to promote an auto-immune response to the vaccine. As the day ran on, she was in a lot of pain. She had been in pain since Friday and was trying to deal with that. The patient further stated her blood pressure is back, no illness. After the seizure her blood pressure went back to normal and at this time it is perfectly fine. The back pain she experienced went from the brain down to her backbone. The pain is gone. It started to go away after the seizure and by Sunday 07Mar2021 it was totally gone. At first it was like she could not walk (05Mar2021). It was like she/her back was on fire (05Mar2021). The patient also mentioned if she moves her head quickly, she can feel like she will have a headache, hangover. She feels it in her back. She feels like she is near recovery, and this is a feeling she does not thing will stay. She further went on to say her hip where she fell is a different story. However, this is associated to a fall and not a vaccine. She was having this problem when she had the vaccine, but the vaccine caused it to be more and extra aggravating.  She later added, when she first got home along with head tingling her hands were tingling as well. When her brain and hands were going through this tingling sensation, she started to notice the back trouble and it was also in her abdomen area and in her legs causing trouble walking (05Mar2021). The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events trouble walking, could not walk, tingling sensation and hangover was recovering. Outcome of BP dropped to 70/40 was recovered on Mar2021. Outcome of seizures recovered on 06Mar2021. Outcome of funny taste in mouth was recovered on 05Mar2021. Outcome of back pain was recovered on 07Mar2021. Outcome of bruised up was not recovered. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown. The patient provided an unrelated causality between the vaccine and event fall.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Fall is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.

                                                started with slight headache early in the morning.  I attributed this to pollen and allergies.  It last most of day.  Then at 4:30 my head began to pound.  I felt dizzy and extremely nauseous.  This lasted about 4 hours and then I felt much better.

Medical history included chronic pain, pancreatitis, allergic to medications, old injury in her right arm, menopause and an ongoing mass in parotid lobe discovered in 2019 with CT scan. MRI performed in Mar2020 and CT scan in Oct2020. She stated that they are just watching it because it has not changed. Well defined borders are present, caller stated that doctor was unconcerned. Her mother had heart disease. Ongoing concomitant medications included ibuprofen for chronic pain and gabapentin from 2019 for chronic pain. The patient also took unspecified medication for pancreatitis. She has taken all kinds of stuff after pancreatitis but they do not work. The patient got deadly ill from the flu shot. Unsure of onset age, vaccine/brand name, or vaccination date. She stated that it was before 2003, possibly in the late 1990&#39;s or early 2000&#39;s. The patient had no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine and no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. On unspecified date the patient experienced diabetes; on 25Feb2021, the patient experienced dizzy, stomach feels odd, hot flashes, severe fatigue, sweating, stomach aches, acid reflux, upper abdominal pain radiating to back; on 26Feb2021 she experienced tightening of chest every so often; and in Feb2021, she had headache. It was further reported as follows: The patient stated that she took the Pfizer shot, clarified that she received the Covid-19 vaccine, on 25Feb2021, not quite 2 weeks ago. She stated that she had a little bit of a reaction after receiving the vaccination while there, so they were monitoring her. She has been experiencing hot flashes, sweating, and stomach aches for 2 days. She cannot get rid of hot flashes and that she has not had a hot flash in 2 years. She states that she has been down for 2 days with fatigue, that it&#39;s really bad. She is inquiring if the side effects that she is experiencing are common side effects and if it is ok to get 2nd shot.  Her second vaccine is scheduled for 17Mar2021.  She stated that she wanted to take the time to make a report as she is allergic to medications. While inquiring about dates of vaccines and side effects, she stated that she was experiencing tightening of chest every so often. She stated that she only had a few days of stomach pain and she has not stopped eating. She is unable to concentrate (unspecified date) and she has been experiencing headaches, experiencing them twice in 2 weeks.  She also reported that she has been having upper abdominal pain radiating to her back. This concerns her, every time she gets it, it scares her. She had pancreatitis when she was 36. It is a nightmare thought. Does this sound like maybe she is possibly starting Diabetes? She reported that this shot has triggered everything. She has an old injury in her right arm. Her arm is killing her, her hands are swelled up, she has acid reflux again, she felt terrible. She stated that the dizziness not as strong as it was at the beginning. The fatigue it comes and goes and that she has spurts where she is energetic.  She stated that it&#39;s more on than off. She is no longer having stomach aches. She compared the pain to pains of constipation. She also stated that she was constipated after receiving the vaccine on unspecified date. She had nausea at the beginning.

She experienced upper abdominal pain yesterday and some this morning, but it was mostly in her back this morning. Her Sweating is off and on. She experienced headache just a couple of times but that she has not had one in a while.  She stated that they lasted only an hour or two, and that she does not usually get headaches. She suggested that these may be due to sinuses and weather change. She has been taking Ibuprofen twice a day as treatment. But she normally takes Ibuprofen for chronic pain. Supposed to be 3 times a day but she does not want to take that much. She stated that all of this could also be stress related and that this could also be menopause.

The outcome of the events dizzy, sweating, tightening of chest every so often, upper abdominal pain radiating to back, headache was recovering; the outcome of stomach feels odd, hot flashes, severe fatigue, acid reflux was not recovered. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                Directly after getting the shot I was sleeping harder than I ever have for about 14 days then on March 4 woke up after a very deep sleep tired the next day the same thing March 5 woke up extremely fatigued March 6 same thing woke up extremely fatigued and after going for a short bike ride started getting an intense headache, set up got very dizzy, then proceeded to throw up harder than I ever have and so debilitatingly that I had to call the paramedics and they took me to the emergency room. The ER doc at first said that this could not be an adverse effect 14 days later of the first Covid shot, but then he said he didn?t know, for the next nine days I did not leave my house I was so exhausted. I am an athlete and exercise every day have tons of energy all day long and have never felt this way before.  I then met with my regular Doctor Who ordered tests of different varieties everything came back normal and to this day which is now March 25 I have extreme fatigue and I can barely work. Like I said above I am an athlete I run five days a week ride my bike two days a week and swim generally two or three days a week and work as a teacher and I can barely do any of that.

                                                Between 10 and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt like someone had thumped me in the chest over my left breast. I tried to breathe deeply, and I started to feel light headed. I didn&#39;t tell anyone, I was let go after 15 minutes. I sat in my car about 5 minutes and then decided I was worse. I was weak and shaky and light headed, my top lip was fuzzy feeling. I didn&#39;t feel like there was a blockage in my airway but I felt like I was having trouble getting my rib cage to expand so I could breathe. I went back in and was sat down, I was evaluated. Paramedics were called, by time they came I was lightheaded and I was foggy brained. I couldn&#39;t respond easily. My BP was 165/99 and my heart rate was 98. my O2 was fine but by that time I felt like I had to work hard to get a deep breath. I was feeling worse quickly. I was taken to the ER in a wheelchair. I was put in a bed and hooked me up to monitors. I was left alone for a while. When the dr came in he checked me out and listen to my lungs. I had a hard time getting my lungs to expand. Doctor ordered a blood sugar test and it was below 100. Chest x-ray, EKG and blood work. He told me later that everything was normal. I was there for 2 hours before I felt like I could go home. I didn&#39;t receive any medication. I was able to breathe easier by time I left the hospital. I was thinking more clearly as well. The next day I was still feeling shaky and weak. I went to my PCP on friday and I was feeling normal by then.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: EN6208; Expiration Date: Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Mar2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing celiac disease diagnosed in 2012 and has been gluten free ever since, allergies, and anxiety. Concomitant medications included zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) taken for sleep; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for allergies; alprazolam (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for anxiety; vitamin d nos (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for immune system health; and magnesium (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for health. The patient previously received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (Lot number: EN6203) at 61 years of age on 26Feb2021 between 5:15PM and 5:30PM in the left arm at a single dose for covid-19 immunization and the flu vaccine (INFLUENZA) for immunization 15 years ago and experienced arm was sore. There were no other prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. On 19Mar2021, the patient experienced sore arm. On 21Mar2021, the patient experienced a little off, fatigue, brain fog, a little tired. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced severe vertigo, fall down on the floor, nausea, vomited, horrible spinning, generalized weakness. In 2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t open her eyes, couldn&#39;t eat, nystagmus, could not walk at all without help. On an unknown date, the patient experienced dizzy. The events, severe vertigo, fall down on the floor, nausea, vomited, and horrible spinning, required emergency room and physician office (video) visits. The patient was hospitalized for severe vertigo, fall down on the floor, nausea, vomited, and horrible spinning from 31Mar2021 to 02Apr2021. The clinical course was as follows: the patient received the second dose on 19Mar2021 and she didn&#39;t really have any bad side effects, a sore arm, and a little tired on the second day, maybe a little off but was fine. 12 days later she was vacuuming and had severe vertigo, she was down on the floor, just horrible spinning, horrible nausea and laid on floor and vomited all day. Her doctor told her to go to the ER. They did all kinds of tests with unknown results on an unknown date and she could not open her eyes for 2 days, she was so violently spinning with vertigo, they gave her fluids. She went in on Wednesday and by Friday she was a little better, she could open her eyes, still had spinning and vertigo. It was like nystagmus, her eyes were, she just really couldn&#39;t open her eyes for the doctor, had generalized weakness and couldn&#39;t walk at all without help in the hospital. The only time she moved from one position was to go to the bathroom with assistance. In the ER, she could not get up out of bed the first night they were trying all ways of catharizing her. She could not even get out of the bed with the help, they had to carry her to the CAT scan with negative result on 31Mar2021. She had slightly improved but still had vertigo and she was not vomiting anymore, that was only the first couple days. She was sent home with medications for dizziness and nausea but they didn&#39;t do anything. Two weeks later she was still dizzy, had vertigo, it was way better than it was, she can open the windows a little bit but she was basically in a dark room for like the first week and a half. Not violent like it was the first couple of days. The events were further described as: she was a little sore on 19Mar2021, 20Mar2021, 21Mar2021, and maybe the 22Mar2021 her arm was still sore. She clarified the sore arm pretty much ended on the 22Mar2021. She was surprised she felt fine on 19Mar2021 and 20Mar2021 and on the evening of 21Mar2021, in the middle of the night between 20Mar2021 and 21Mar2021 she felt a little off and a little more tired. On 21Mar2021, she didn&#39;t feel great, fatigued and brain fog but was fine after that. She began feeling a little off and a little tired early morning on the 21Mar2021. That was pretty much gone by the 22Mar2021. The feeling tired and a little off and the brain fog and fatigue went away 22Mar2021. She vomited constantly, started suddenly and violently and was incapable of moving, all she did was vomit and lay on the floor. It was a complete 360, she was fine vacuuming a minute before and then suddenly got dizzy and went down and could never get up. She had to be taken from upstairs in her house and transported to the hospital. She was not really experiencing the nausea now, she was not completely herself but she can eat, she couldn&#39;t eat for the first couple of days and was on IV fluids and once she got out of the hospital was able to eat a little and now eating almost normally. It took a week to eat normally and she couldn&#39;t eat holiday dinner on 04Apr2021. From 31Mar2021 to 10Apr2021, every day the nausea has slightly been improving. She was not quite herself and still has vertigo and was making herself eat her meals. She vomited 30 times and in the hospital they gave her an IV to stop that and never vomited in hospital, maybe once in the ER. She confirmed the 31Mar2021 was the last time she vomited. She had not recovered completely from nausea. She used be running around all the time, she would walk 10 miles per week to exercise, yesterday she had a mammogram scheduled and she was just so wiped out for doing something for the first time and had to lie down for the whole rest of the day. She was hospitalized from 31Mar2021 until the evening of 02Apr2021 when they let her out. She was given medication for nausea and dizziness didn&#39;t do anything. She was given ondasetron (ZOFRAN), 4 mg and meclizine. Because of her weakness, the patient was checked to see if there was any brain bleed or brain stem problems that would explain the vertigo and did not find anything. The tests were negative for any brain problems on an unknown date. Lab data included: blood levels: low on vitamin d (probably because she was not absorbing nutrients as well) on an unknown date, endoscopy: unknown results on an unknown date, and MRI: negative on 01Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe vertigo, fall down on the floor, nausea, horrible spinning, vomited, and dizzy. The clinical outcome of the events, severe vertigo, nausea, generalized weakness, could not open her eyes, nystagmus, could not walk at all without help, was recovering. The clinical outcome of the events, fall down on the floor, horrible spinning, dizzy, was unknown. The clinical outcome of the events, a little off, fatigue, sore arm, brain fog, and a little tired, was recovered on 22Mar2021. The clinical outcome of the event, vomited, was recovered on 31Mar2021. The clinical outcome of the event, could not eat, was recovered in 2021.    No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 62-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 26Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8733; Expiration Date: Jul2021) as single dose at age of 61-year-old for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant medications included methotrexate; hydroxychloroquine. Adverse event following prior vaccinations violently ill from flu shot, ended up in urgent care, 20 years. The patient experienced every time she bends over, if her head gets below her shoulders to pick something up she will black out, fever, everything in her body ached, vertigo on an unspecified date in 2021. Clinical course: The first Covid 19 vaccine she ran a fever and everything in her body ached. Every time she bends over, if her head gets below her shoulders to pick something up she will black out. She reports she has blacked out in the shower and blacked out from leaning off the sofa to pet her dog. She almost went into her coffee table trying to pet her dog. This lasted for about 5 days after she received her first Covid 19 vaccine. After about 5 days it cleared up and went away. She called the facility that gave her the Covid 19 vaccine, a drive thru facility and they told her she had vertigo. She knows she didn&#39;t have vertigo because she didn&#39;t have these problems until after she received the Covid 19 vaccines. Outcome of event black out was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown.

A 61-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (BNT162B2) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot Number: TW0151) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cancer, pneumonia, pain in her lungs, smoker and arthritis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced what scared her was not feeling like she was getting enough oxygen on an unspecified date, problems breathing/her breathing still almost feels labored on 11Apr2021, arm hurt on 09Apr2021, pain in her back where her lungs are on 11Apr2021, hot and cold sweats on 10Apr2021, dizzy on 10Apr2021, shaky on 10Apr2021, nausea on 13Apr2021, body pain/flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders on 11Apr2021, out of it on 11Apr2021, weak on 10Apr2021, tired on 10Apr2021, headache on 10Apr2021, anxious on 10Apr2021, fever on 10Apr2021, itchy on 09Apr2021, feeling like maybe there is something wrong with her spleen on an unspecified date, the pain is in the left side of the back kind of by the lungs on an unspecified date, she has been sick on an unspecified date, her mental status was also affected on an unspecified date. Patient had the first dose of the Covid Vaccine on 09Apr2021 and gradually her arm hurt, she had hot sweats, she felt dizzy, was shaky, had nausea, and had body pain. The one thing she is concerned about was she had pain in her back where her lungs are and she was having problems breathing. She has a little bit of that still. She has also been out of it. Her breathing still almost feels labored, and this past weekend she thought she would go to the emergency room. Her main concern is this awful pain in her back while she was having problems breathing and getting enough oxygen. She felt weak, dizzy, and shaky. She got scared. She has been sick, she had cancer a long time ago. What scared her was not feeling like she was getting enough oxygen. The pain is in the left side of the back kind of by the lungs. It goes directly from the front to the back. On Monday it started feeling better. Today it is so much better. She will feel like she is not getting enough oxygen or giving a full breath and then this in her back. She remembers having pneumonia years ago and having pain in her lungs. That&#39;s why she knows the pain is in the back of her lungs. She has to say she is a smoker. She slowed down and couldn&#39;t smoke this week or during that. She kind of quit, that&#39;s her reality now. The pain comes and goes throughout the day but it is not as bad. She didn&#39;t have this shortness of breath and other things until a couple days after she got the vaccine. It gradually came up on her. She was not having trouble breathing, it was more slightly labored. It was not profound, just there. Sometimes when she is speaking after a while she gets tired and will have to take a moment and take a deep breath. It is so much better. She called her primary care physician and was anxious, and all he said was she would feel effects for 2 weeks. He wasn&#39;t very helpful. Her arm hurt the day that she had the shot. Even today there are little bits of pain but very light. 09Apr2021 through 11Apr2021 was when everything really hit. It was hard to lift up her arm. It was a little pain, it was no big deal. She would have the AC on and blast it when she had the hot and cold sweats. She was using napkins because she was sweating profusely. It felt like she obviously had a reaction to the vaccine. It&#39;s normal she guesses. She didn&#39;t expect it for the first dose. The 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th it was really bad. Her whole body was sweating and would get wet. She&#39;d be hot and then cold. She was anxious because she was having problems breathing. She still gets a little bit of hot and cold sweats, but nothing compared to what she went through. As the days go on she is slowly getting better. She was dizzy not just during the day, at night she couldn&#39;t sleep because of it. She has gradually gotten better. Yesterday she tried to do some gardening but felt so weak she had to come back inside. When she gets up she feels weak and a little bit of lack of air. She has labored breathing. She was real itchy. The shakiness, dizziness, and anxiety all came on and were horrible. She doesn&#39;t know if the nausea was because she couldn&#39;t eat and had to take her regular medication. It was very light nausea. She had flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders. Her headache was major too during all of this. The headache is something that comes and goes still. It is a weird kind of headache. She had a fever and got like flu all over body pain. She doesn&#39;t know how to explain how she felt out of it. She doesn&#39;t know if it was the fact she was so sick. She had a feeling of did she do that. She couldn&#39;t make decisions. She would need to take the garbage out and go back to the garbage and think what did she come here for. Her mental status was also affected. The weakness gradually got really bad, and she still hasn&#39;t recovered from it. She still feels weak and tired when trying to do things. She was tired the day after she got the vaccine. The first day she thought it was nothing and she was fine. Gradually it got real bad when she was sick. She didn&#39;t feel that flu-ish feeling but was weak and tired. She got dizzy and she had the brain fog thing. She was having really bad headaches during the same time. The weakness and tiredness go hand in hand. She takes a mineral for her thoracic spine, but she takes that more for elderly arthritis. She doesn&#39;t have any conditions that she thinks played a role. She has been feeling like maybe there is something wrong with her spleen. Took Tylenol for her fever. Mentioned fever would go away and come back. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 102, 99 and 100.1 (unit unspecified) all on unspecified dates.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever and itchy. Outcome of the event problems breathing/her breathing still almost feels labored, arm hurt, pain in her back where her lungs are, hot and cold sweats, dizzy, out of it and headache was recovering. Outcome of the event fever was recovered on 13Apr2021, itchy was recovered with sequelae on 14Apr2021, body pain/flu-like body pain in her muscles over her shoulders was recovered on 16Apr2021, nausea was recovered on 16Apr2021, shaky was recovered on 19Apr2021. Outcome of the event weak and tired was not recovered. Outcome of all the other events was unknown.

I felt more dizzy and laid down. I also had a rapid HR but did not take my pulse. The dizziness fluctuated and gradually cleared over 20-30 min. A third bp was 146/84 and a last bp approx 30min after the injection was 124/76 and I felt well enough to get up and walk.

A 62-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT#: GL3248 (Caller said that the G may be an E.)), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at second single dose for working with cancer patients. Medical history included ongoing diabetic and ongoing hyperthyroidism, both diagnosed about 6 years ago and were under control. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 for working with cancer patients (First dose, lot number: EJ1685, injection in the left arm). On 11Jan2021 the patient had chills, joint pain, and lower GI symptoms. Her lower GI symptoms included diarrhea. Then caller clarified that it was not diarrhea but the urge to go. The stools were solid. She also had lots of flatulence. She was also wiped out of energy, around like 2 PM on 11Jan2021 she went up a flight of stairs and was so exhausted. The patient is a nurse. She was in her office that day and had to literally lay on the floor because she was so wiped out of energy. She left work early and went to bed. Then the next day 12Jan2021, she was unable to get out of bed the whole day. She is so sleepy and has no energy. She went to bed last night at 08:30, but is still so sleepy. Today she is feeling better, but still had lower GI symptoms. She was also feeling cold, which she normally is always hot. She was having to put 5 blankets on her. Outcome of the event chills was recovered on 12Jan2021, of events joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed was recovering, of events flatulence and feeling cold was unknown. The reporter considered the event chills, joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed as serious (disability) and related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported chills, joint pain, lower GI symptoms, wiped out of energy, unable to get out of bed and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, given the plausible temporal association.

EMTs were called but I didn&#39;t go to the hospital.  My son picked me up and took me home because I was unable to drive.  On the way I experienced loss of vision and speech for about 5 minutes.  When I got home, my legs were so shaky that I had to have help walking.  I started getting severe chills that took 3 hours to get warm (2 heavy blankets, space heater, and heating pad).  I was very fatigued and felt bad the rest of the day.  (Saturday)The next day I had flu-like symptoms; headache, joint aches, chills, nausea, extreme fatigue.  Sunday was better but still had to rest most of the day because when I would stay up for over 30 minutes, the symptoms would return.  Monday-  stomach cramps, headache, fatigue  but went to work (30 minutes late due to stomach) and left 30 minutes early.

                                                The vaccine was injected too high in left arm. I know this because I am a retired pharmacist and when I removed the bandage noticed injection was near the shoulder and not in the mid deltoid area. The left arm/shoulder began to feel sore in the evening and was very sore the next day. Was unable to lift arm or move without pain. Over the next several days the severe pain decreased, but I continue to have pain in the arm, especially the bicep area. Range of motion is limited. Severe pain when trying to lift my arm from resting position while in bed. Severe pain when rotating arm inward. Pain occurs with certain movements.

Predisone and Benadryl was prescribed.  Thurs. 01/28 Call to let them know that it wasn?t working.  I went into the office for one shot of Solumedrol.  This help and they were gone.  They gave me second dose of Predisone to take in case it came back and to continue the Benadryl.  02/8 Second vaccine.  Hives began that night: arms, torso, thighs, hair.  Call the Dr. on 02/10 and suggested I go to an allergist.  Went to allergist on 02/11 she said to only take one Predisone, Allegra one am and one at noon, then take zertek at nighttime.  The Predisone created a major brain fog, I had to stop.  Saw the allergist on 2/18, she agreed to get off the Predisone.  02/11 I passed out in the am and when I woke up with vomit running down my face.  Still suffering with hives this entire time.  02/17 my face, lips, tongue started to swell and I had chest pain for 90 minutes.  My feel swelled and I have hives so bad on my feet I could not walk or put on shoes.  02/20 Woke up with sweat on my chest.  My hands were so swollen I had to have my wedding ring was cut off .  02/21 I went to the Urgent Care and received a shot of Solumedrol.  They said this should last me for a few days. 02/21 woke up 3 time throughout the night soaked in sweat.

Within a few days it was painful to move my arm backward, upward and forward. The pain lasted over a week; I contact Primary Physician and he recommended ice and acetaminophen. I did that for several days and by day 10 it was spreading to my shoulder area and radiating down my arm. On 2/25 I went to urgent care (primary is 50 miles) and then my Primary is preparing consult for Ortho.

                                                About 7-8 hours after Vaccine (1st dose), I developed severe arm pain and could not lift my arm and noticed numbness/tingling in my right little finger.  I went to bed and woke up at around 2:30 AM, I had very hot, stabbing, shooting pain running up and down my arm into my neck and upper shoulder. I also had pain running down my arm. This pain was a 9/10 and lasted for 3-4 hours non stop. I was up most of the night and considered going to the ED. The following day, I still had numbness/tingling in my right little finger.  I was able to move my arm a little more but not enough. The numbness/tingling took 3-4 days to go away and the arm soreness took 5-6 days to go away.  I received the shot from a Pharmacy Intern. I do have shoulder problems but this was not normal. I am a RN. I am very thin, weighing around 107 lbs. I wondered about the technique used or the length of the needle, or the possibility that I was allergic to something in the vaccine. I was also very, very tired for 2-3 days. I do have a sore arm after the flu vaccine but not like this. I will not be receiving the second vaccine, even though I am immunocompromised. I did call my MD office but did not go in.

                                                The first reaction - 15 minutes after the vaccine - I felt really dizzy and loopy. She told me, I think you better sit back down. I felt better after sitting there for 30 minutes after. I didn&#39;t get dizzy again. I finished my workday. Next morning, I woke up with a fever 100.8 (about). I woke up with sore muscles - I tend to get sore muscles easily but I felt more sore than normal and I had a headache. Fever stopped after 24 hours. Note: I also get dizzy really easily - and so it isn&#39;t difficult for something to make me dizzy.  I also felt really tired. And over the weekend, I felt nauseated (not initially but over the weekend.) And that lasted until about midday Monday (over the weekend) to be getting better . I took Tylenol and I rested. That helped with the symptoms.

I stayed in place until I felt better about 30 minutes. For the rest of that day and the next day I was extremely tired, a little nauseous, and kind of out of it. The third day I had very sore left arm at site and very sore and tender lymph notes on left side of Arm and trunk. Six days after the shot I came suddenly down with a massive headache and diarrhea. Al has since resolved and I am on day eight.

                                                The night of the injection, I had severe pain in my neck, back of my head and right arm.  The pain was so severe that I could not move my head or arm all night.  I took Advil but could not sleep from the pain.  When I did manage to sleep, I would have horrible dreams.   By morning, I was feeling better but still sore from my neck and arm.  I felt very tired and rested the entire next day.   Pain has not returned.  It was very scary.

I still have some chest heaviness and still having asthma issues which includes coughing.  I also had side effects of sore arm, chills, fatigue.  Did not seek treatment.  I had no idea how long this would last.  I wish I would have read the paperwork for severe allergic reaction, but I didn&#39;t. I would have gone to the ER.  I have suffered with this since Saturday.

Two days after the vaccine, while at orthopedist (for a Rotator Cuff Surgery), I began to feel dizzy.  I sat down for a few minutes, drank some water, and then resumed my therapy.  After the first set of my 4th exercises I began to get dizzy, I sat down on the PT table, then laid down and fainted for about 1-2 seconds.  My blood pressure plummeted to 60/?. EMT?s and an ambulance were called.  I was given an IV and taken to hospital.  In the ER, my blood pressure elevated to 205/121. (I think that was it.)  I was given a cat scan, ekg, chest X-ray, blood tests, etc.  All tests were normal except a very slight (by one number)  magnesium level.  I was admitted for observation and more tests where performed.  My blood pressure remained high, but I had no more dizziness or syncope.  I was given many more blood tests, imagining, ultrasound of heart, ultrasound of carotid arteries,  ultrasound ?bubble test,? nuclear heart treadmill stress test.  All tests were normal.  The only change in my health that can be attributed to this episode is the Covid vaccine.

Immediate reaction to Pfizer vaccine #1--flushed/hot, strong metallic taste, chemical smell, tachycardia (156-158),  nausea, some chest discomfort and dizziness.  BP 158/85 (my normal is 100/60). O2 sats 98%.  I did not feel anxious until heart rate would not come down to baseline. Clinic staff monitored me and did not treat. Allowed heart rate to decrease  over time. Took over 20 minutes to get below 120.  At 35 minutes, it was below 100. Stayed at clinic for one hour and released. Still had metallic taste (over 3 days now), loss taste, loss of appetite, headache, and fatigue.

                                                Ever so slight tingle in tongue within 30 mins with difficulty moving legs.  Arrived home and slept 5 hours.  Spouse woke me up to eat.  I was polite and took a few bites.  Went to bed @ 10 pm.  The next morning I woke in the fetal position and COULD NOT MOVE!  Called husband for help.  He lifted me to the sit up position by my rib cage.  Very difficult to move for 4 days.  Had Gammagard treatment on March 16. 2021.  That was a mistake, I guess.  I could not even think clearly enough to try to fill out this form.

I left work early and went home to lay down.  I took 2 aspirin.  I slept for 20 minutes and woke up feeling better.  My doctors office was closed since this happened on a Friday.  I consulted with a friend that is a RN and she advised going to emergency room.  I have horrible health insurance so I didn?t want to pay 650.00 to go to emergency room. I?m not sure I want to get the second shot since I have heard that adverse reactions increase with the second shot.

A 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 12Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation; cyclobenzaprine, prednisone and hydrocodone; all via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated, &#34;First, I had COVID back in early December and then on 12Mar2021, I got my first vaccine and I have lot of aches and pain and very foggy brain. I was just with the &#39;chiropractor&#39; and he was just with me and I stood up and we were talking and I just got super dizzy and almost passed out, I just don&#39;t know. I missed, I can&#39;t even focus.&#34; When clarified the concern, the patient stated, &#34;When I stood up and I had been standing for a minute or two and it wasn&#39;t that I got up too fast and then I got very dizzy and almost passed out, luckily there was a chair to catch me. So, my concern is, do I get the second vaccine if I already had COVID, should I didn&#39;t had this first vaccine since I already tested positive? When I had COVID, I was very cloudy in the brain. I don&#39;t know if this is a part of side effect, I am trying to find out if I can get the second vaccine.&#34; The patient experienced kidney stone. The lab data is clear, upon checking, the blood and urine samples. CAT scan has been done and the report is clear. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 62-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: FR8737and expiry date was not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm, on 07Apr2021, as a single dose (at the age of 62-years) for COVID-19 immunization. Patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6201 and expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, in left upper arm, on 05Mar2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient arm hurt after first dose (began immediately and lasted for about 4 days) which was resolved on 09Mar2021. Patient second dose was scheduled on 27Mar2021, but she did not get it till 07Apr2021. It was reported that on 08Apr2021, patient had such an awful reaction to the second dose of the vaccine. She started to get dizzy and weak, chills, everything was a blur, sweating, could not drink threw up if she tried dry heave went back to sleep and slept for 48 hours had just chills the whole time. She was in bed sleeping trying to drink, getting up to go to the bathroom and feeling like she was going to die for the next three days. She was nauseated and is still nauseated and could not drive. She took Tylenol an antiemetic at urgent care that stopped. She took Zofran with the saline solution infusion and she went home and slept. She was dehydrated and had soreness all over. On 09Apr2021, she could not roll over and had a sore on her left butt cheek that was still there cold sores on lips. She thought the sore on her left butt cheek came from laying in bed so much, and it was not in any other space but that one spot almost like she would have gotten the shot there, but she didn&#39;t. On 10Apr2021, patient felt like she was going to die, and went to urgent care and asked if they could give her fluids. They gave her fluids and Zofran and that helped a lot. This one shocked the hell out her, she thinks it was her gums that started to bleed on 11Apr2021. She had the best oral hygiene and went to the dentist all the time. She was flosses like crazy. She started to drink a ton of water and has not seen it since. She cannot guess what the reason was. On 11Apr2021, she could function a little and had chills again last night and sweating. She did not have a fever. She ate chicken noodle soup water and a little bit of ginger ale. She started to feel better, but not 100% better not even 90%, not even 80%, but was heading towards the right direction. Patient also hasn&#39;t eaten for 5 days after second dose. She experienced cold and hot. She was not complaining at all and she has been sick for days and cannot eat and will throw up but will gain it right back. The dizziness and weakness were subsided. She feels like she is getting beat up but is recovering. Patient thought that vaccine pulled out with a syringe and that&#39;s the problem everyone gets the same dose. Patient&#39;s weight was 136 or 138 lbs. Outcome of the events nauseated after second dose was resolved on 10Apr2021, and dizzy and weak after second dose was resolved on an unknown date in Apr 2021, and for the events chills and sweating it was recovering, and for all other events, it was unknown.

Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207; Expiry date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration to the right arm on 13Mar2021 at 13:30 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine other than dose 1 of 2 of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. Regarding concomitant products and other medical conditions patient reported none other than just her inhalers which doses of had to be increased in response to symptoms after first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. Concomitant medication included tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) taken as Dose increased to twice in the morning daily for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing, (Lot number: 0014678, ; Expiration Date: Jan20230); fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) 500 taken as Dose increased from once daily to twice daily an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; azelastine hydrochloride (Lot Number: 3N2E, Expiration Date: Feb2022), fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing (Lot number: GA00510, Expiration date: May2022); prednisone (PREDNISONE) taken for an unspecified indication with quantity of 27, Dose: 3-20mg daily for 7 days, then 2-20mg daily for 2 days, then 1-20mg daily for 3 days and Ongoing therapy. She also used a nose spray that didn&#39;t work so they switched her back to Dymista nose spray.   Consumer stated that she received both doses of Pfizer&#39;s COVID vaccine and had reactions to both of them. Consumer stated that, &#34;The second dose was even worse. They put her on Prednisone. She did not know if she should be tested again or not? She was sitting up but she could not walk around anywhere. She had 2 broken knees. She could not walk anywhere. After the second dose, they had to bring her to the hospital because she couldn&#39;t even walk to her car. She got home and she had been sick ever since. She had allergies too. She could not do anything. she had a hard time breathing. she was hesitant to get the 2nd one, but everybody said to get it. Her IgG level was down to 300 something. She was also tapering off of prednisone and she did not want to be tapering off it because it was worked well for her. She could tell by her breathing that it was helped her. She could taste sodium in her mouth constantly since she had got the vaccination.&#34; Second dose completed her prescribed therapy. Dates for Symptoms From 15Mar2021 to Ongoing Reported seriousness for Symptoms reported as Unspecified and the Symptoms was reported as worsened. Patient&#39;s doctor dropped her last week, told her she didn&#39;t know what to do with her, and that this was too stressful.  Onset of symptoms following first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine was on 17Mar2021. She couldn&#39;t breathe very well when she went in for the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She was ok the first day after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, seemed ok, arm didn&#39;t hurt; but then had onset of symptoms. She has been in bed the whole time since onset of symptoms, was in bed for over 2 weeks. She slept for 2 days straight, only got up for water and the bathroom. It was bad, getting hard to breathe. She had to use her emergency inhaler. The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine messed up her Meniere&#39;s disease. Doctor started patient on Prednisone for these symptoms, and Prednisone is really the only thing that clears up Meniere&#39;s disease because her ears was full and she could not get up. Prednisone helped her and I relayed in her &#39;rescue&#39; inhalers (treatment) because she did 2 in the morning, two inhalers anyway when she started to feel better, she got her second one and it made her worst.  She did not eat anything salty or anything, the barometric pressure was not bad. It was really funny because she had just finished everything and it was a few days before she had to go get her second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine shot. She was just starting to feel normal, at least normal for her, she could get up normal and drive. They gave her the second shot of Pfizer-BioNTech and it was like a double. She clarified as she got like double the amount of symptoms that she had experienced following the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine.  She is tasting sodium in her mouth from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She can&#39;t have much sodium which struck up the Meniere&#39;s disease really bad the second day after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine; her allergies in her head went bonkers. She could not talk, it was closing up her throat, she was coughing every time she eats or dinks, and she&#39;s having a &#34;really bad&#34; adverse reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after the second dose. They had to take her out of the hospital to her car in a wheelchair &#34;right after&#34; getting the second shot. She could not get more than 1000 mg of sodium a day, she tastes it in her mouth constantly, she could not get rid of it and it was &#34;going through her system&#34;. She wanted to know what to do, since her doctor told her to contact Pfizer. She wanted to know what part of the vaccine is doing that, she assures it is sodium, because sodium is in her mouth 24/7 and she could not get it out, she could not have that much sodium in her body. It was still getting really hard to breathe. She is still taking the Prednisone she was initially prescribed and started on for the symptoms that started after her first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. She is tapering off of Prednisone, and she shouldn&#39;t be tapering off, she thinks she needs to be Prednisone for some more days, maybe 3 more days, then she would be ok. It was prescribed as a 7-day burst of Prednisone. She mentioned that the only Prednisone that works on her is the Actavis manufactured Prednisone; her pharmacy orders it for her because they know that. She called the emergency room Saturday when she was really bad. They said they had a line there and it was going to be at least a 4 hour wait. With patient&#39;s low immune system, Meniere&#39;s disease and that she could hardly breathe she did not go to the emergency room because she could catch something and die while waiting. She decided she would just stay at home and rest. She has not had any Physician&#39;s office visit relative to event; she has a telephone appointment tomorrow to see if the doctor is going to be her doctor. She had to cancel her appointment with the doctor today because if she has something she doesn&#39;t want to spread it, she feels worse now and with the Meniere&#39;s she is tasting sodium in her mouth constantly from the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, she does not eat a lot of salt. The flu shot takes her a couple of days, then she is right back up and Vaccination Last dose on Oct2020. Consumer stated that she has &#39;Meniere&#39;s&#39; disease (History) and it made her worse. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included IgG level: 300. Reporter stated the seriousness for the events was Unspecified. Seriousness of event Meniere&#39;s disease aggravated was medically significant. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Injection was given very high on my L arm. Vaccinator said she had difficulty injecting vaccine-taking about 15 seconds to complete injection. Injection was painful. Within 1 hour I could not raise my arm more than 30 degrees without severe pain. Diminished ROM and pain at night is ongoing. Within 4 hours, I had a low grade fever with chills, headache and myalgia that persisted for 12 hours then respoved.  I am awaiting an appointment with my primary care physician and will know then if more treatment will be recommended. Incident Report filed at the hospital.

The tachycardia resolved without medical intervention within 2 minutes.  The remainder of the symptoms remained the rest of the day, along with profound fatigue and intermittent self limited tachycardia.  The headache was managed with Tylenol.  I slept most of the  day and through the night.  The following day, I had a headache, which was mild.  Fatigue remained.  I also noted intermittent tachycardia with mild exertion, self limited, less than 1 minute.  Mild soreness at injection site.

Re the Vertigo, I didn&#39;t fall but experienced it whenever moving.  I was bumping into walls and was dizzy whenever I moved position (e.g. sitting to standing &amp; vice versus).  These symptoms lasted 5-7 days after they began (both shots).

                                                2.5 hours after receiving vaccine, I started getting dizzy and vomiting. I vomited 6 or 7 times. I was so dizzy I couldn&#39;t open my eyes without getting sick. We called ER and explained that we thought I was having a reaction to the vaccine, and their response was they had never heard of that type of reaction. I was sick all night, called my primary Dr in the am and they told me to go to ER. We had to call ambulance to take me there because I was so sick and couldn&#39;t open my eyes without having to vomit. Room spun in circles. My arrival at ER, they did MRI, EKG, blood work. My blood pressure was very high, so they connected me to a heart monitor. I had low Magnesium due to vomiting so much.  I was treated with Valium and anti-vert medication and fluids. I stayed overnight in hospital- had PT Jan 13th  for DX of Vertigo. Then referred to Outpatient PT for Vertigo.  Dr&#39;s felt it was a &#34;coincident&#34; that I got Vertigo shortly after vaccine, and strongly felt it was not related.  . Today is Jan 17th, and I am still dizzy, but feeling better. I have an appointment with my primary Jan 18th and not sure if I should take the 2nd dose. That is the question.

Just the injection process alone made me feel ill. So I waited the 15 minutes before I left, until I felt safe to drive. At noon the meds started affecting me, which is what I expected. I&#39;ve continued to experience arm pain, weakness, armpit swelling and tenderness, arm not wanting to work and posturing. This is day four and its just starting to feel like its coming back &#34;online.&#34; Monday I reported to Colleague Health, who advised me to contact my physician, who I consulted via phone this morning. Physician requested I fill out Adverse Event form.

                                                As I was sitting at my computer and suddenly I could barely keep my eyes open, I was so tired I couldn&#39;t lift my arms and once I closed my eyes, I could not muster the strength to open them.  I felt like I was going to faint and then I got nauseated and I knew I was going to throw up. With my husband&#39;s help, I did manage to get to the bathroom (about 6 steps away).  I threw up and immediately sat down in the nearest chair.  I threw up a second time into a vessel after that.  I then got a massive headache and chills.  I could barely walk with assistance up the stairs to go to bed.  I have never been more fatigued.  After going to bed, I slept all night and woke the next day still fatigued, but nothing like the night before.  I was able to work, even though I felt really tired.  I did not have much of an appetite all day and two days later, I still feel fatigued.

Second dose nausea the first night, extreme fatigue the second day which was gone by day 3. Headache from day after vaccine until today (5 days later)  with more severe headache and dizziness today, but not bad enough to make me not be able to function.

Injection was painful. Within 1 hour I could not raise my arm more than 30 degrees without severe pain. Diminished ROM and pain at night is ongoing. Within 4 hours, I had a low grade fever with chills, headache and myalgia that persisted for 12 hours then respoved. Incident Report filed at the hospital. MRI done on 1/20/2021-saw Doctor on 1/22/2021 who diagnosed adhesive capsulitis.

                                                Patient received her vaccine on Thursday, 1/21/21.  From then until Saturday afternoon she had been experiencing extreme fatigue.  On Sat. around 5:00 PM she was standing at her flat-top stove cooking dinner.   A wave of very extreme fatigue came over her, so she leaned over to turn off the burner.  When she did this, she passed out leaning forward with her hand on the burner and touching the frying pan.  When she came to, she went to the couch and laid down - not realizing for 10 minutes that her hand and right breast were burned.   The resulting injuries lead to her having to see her PCP on Monday, and then a General Surgeon on Weds 1/27/21.   Injuries sustained include a second degree burn on her right breast, On the right arm, laterally above the wrist is a small superficial partially healed burn.  On the dorsal aspect of the right fifth finger there is a longitudinal burn that goes from the MCP joint to almost the tip of the finger.  She has limited range of motion due to discomfort and swelling.  The blister encompasses the entire dorsal lateral aspect of the finger. The fourth right finger has a less extensive blistered area on the PIP joint.   The burn on the fifth finger is  deep second degree.

The next morning I was dizzy, lightheaded, mild headache, nausea, chills. It went all throughout the day. I just drank some clear liquids and ate some soup. When I woke up the next day about 36 hours after receiving the vaccine I had low energy, nauseous, and lightheaded . By that night my arm started feeling weird, it had a tinging feeling, I went to look at it the mirror and there was a red area and bumps but  it was lower under the injection site. It seemed to get worse, swelling and more rash so I took Loratadine 10 MG (antihistamine). I went to bed and when I woke up this morning the rash was gone but the soreness is still there and the tinging feeling in my arm is still there. It feels like when your arm falls asleep.  I tried to called my doctor but their phones are down and I will try reach back out this afternoon.

                                                Pt complained of throat tightness and being lightheaded beginning at 1127 hours (5 minutes after vaccine).  She arrived at emergency/symptoms reporting station at 1129 hours.  She denied tongue swelling, denied rash, denied difficulty speaking.  No rash was seen by medics either.  Pt did not have wheezing or stridor.  Medics on scene and student medics under the direction of Medics, placed the patient on the monitor.  Her HR was stable in the 70s and her sats were 99-100% on room air, with a strong pulse and RR of 16.  The pt became more anxious and demanded that someone assist her with her Epi pen administration. RN explained sxs of anxiety and sxs of anaphylaxis.  Pt became agitated and again remained adamant that medics give her Epi.  At 1132 hours a student medic under the direction of Medics administered the pts own epi pen to her.  Vitals signs after epi were HR of 88, BP of 170/97, RR 22, sats 100% .  A transport unit was called as precaution and to potentially transport.  Pt appeared to have an increase in agitation as indicated by her speech with medics being short and her stating that she was &#34;irritated&#34; with &#34;everyone talking&#34;, that she &#34;can&#39;t hear everyone all at the same time&#34;, that this is just &#34;too much&#34; and waving her hands in the air.  Pt was transported to the ER via Medics for continued care and follow up.

At approximately 3:30 pm I started having a lot of pain in my legs (calves and feet) at first it was extreme pain that led to tingly prickly sensations. I went home, went to bed, was up all night in bed groaning because of the pain, and when I tried to stand, was unable to. I crawled to my phone and called my sister (who lives next door) who ran over. She has a wheelchair and took me to the hospital.  I was unable to walk alone for four days and the pain was not as extreme after 5 days. I am now 3 weeks out and still have numbness in my legs.

                                                When I first got it, I felt okay, but as I was walking out, I felt disoriented and had to sit down. I was very lightheaded and uneasy. I stayed about an hour because I was scared to drive. I later got chills and fever for about 24 hours.  I eventually developed shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness, tightness in my throat, bruising in my legs and painful lymph nodes in my neck and arms. One day, I felt like I was having a mini-stroke. It only lasted for a brief period and then went away. That has occurred multiple times. My doctor thinks some of my issues were due to anxiety, but I don&#39;t agree because I&#39;m fine now.

Then severe vertigo set in, everything started spinning and nausea set in. Waited for 30 minutes and vertigo was better, but not totally gone, but nausea was still there. Left facility and nausea abated after 1.5 hours. Vertigo continued for 48 hours but fairly mild. Caused me to walk like a drunk person but no dizziness any more. Then at 10:30 PM torso broke out in hives that lasted about one hour. No hives on arms and legs.

                                                Pt presented today for 1st Pfizer mRNA COVID vaccine.  She received the vaccine at 11:06am and proceeded to the check out area and scheduled her second appointment and checked out at 11:10am.  She was sitting in the secondary seating area, she looked scared, then she indicated to the APP she felt dizzy, eyes fluttered back, and slumped back into the chair and into APP&#39;s arms.  With the assistance of another RN, we laid her down on the ground and lifted her legs.  She was arousable to sternal rub and complained of dizziness.  She was able to report her name and that her husband was outside in the car waiting for her, however, she was slow to answer questions and still appeared distressed.  We made several attempts to obtain a BP, however, it would not register on machine, O2 sat 100%, HR 42, manual HR 50 at pericordium.  Her bilateral upper extremities were cool to touch and appeared mottled.  We attempted to give her apple juice just she was only able to take a few sips.  We placed her on 100% non-rebreather.  Given low HR, unable to obtain BP, and semi-conscious state, we elected to call 911 at 11:30am.  Her husband was retrieved and at patient side when EMS responded.  He reported that she has fainted in the past with blood draws and has a past medical history of &#34;leaky valve, low platelets&#34; and later it discovered via her medical records that she has a history of seizures and was on vimpat and lisinoril.  EMS arrived, assessed the patient, and moved her to stretcher and transported patient at 11:39am.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 02Mar2021 12:45 as a single dose (at the age of 63-years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure that was treated with metoprolol from an unknown date. The patient had known allergies to penicillin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included metoprolol succinate taken for high blood pressure, start and stop date were not reported; escitalopram taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took prednisone and ciprofloxacin and experienced drug allergy. At about 25 minutes after receiving the vaccine (02Mar2021 13:15 as reported), the patient had a feeling of extreme warmth or heat in the center of her chest (about where her sternum was). It was a sudden feeling that started radiating outward, seemingly along her arteries and at the same time, her heart rate started pounding, accompanied by a lightheaded and dizzy feeling. The warmth was not like a hot flash, nor was it like any kind of digestive issue, it was cardiac related. It wasn&#39;t a panic attack either. The patient started shaking all over while was driving up and immediately looked for a place to pull over, and began texting someone close by (her brother) to let him know what was happening. No treatment was received for the reported events. The reported events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the events was unknown.

When she got to the ER- they had to use the old blood pressure cuff to get her blood pressure because it wasn&#39;t coming up on the machine- the kind where you pump it up and watch the needle, they said it was 58/38. patient states that they asked her about the rash that was all over her body in 2021; caller reports that she did not have a rash when she called at 4 PM. patient describes the rash as an extremely red sunburn rash- like you got really bad sunburn, most of it was on her torso, she also had it on legs on 13Mar2021. patient mentioned she remembers them taking off sock and her toes were purple on 13Mar2021. She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021. Discharge paper reads as anaphylaxis due to vaccination on 13Mar2021. patient states that she came home from hospital on Monday, 15Mar2021. patient reports she started a diet. 2nd day (12Mar2021)- From the time she got up, she was too cold to do anything; she couldn&#39;t walk and she was feeling like she was getting the flu. Saturday (13Mar2021)- She woke up and had the worst Charlie horse between ankle and calf- took forever to walk Charlie horse off. Really sharp Charlie horse. Even had less energy today. Really nauseated. patient reports that yesterday and today, she is just tired. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her body catching up on sleep or she&#39;s just tired; she will find out today when she goes to doctor. Caller mentions that she is normally more active than she feels right now. patient reports her eyes have been itchy and she has a rash on her eyelids. patient doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the shot; patient mentions that she decided on 01Mar2021 she would start a diet, get healthy, and see a nutritionist. patient reports that initially she didn&#39;t think her symptoms were from the vaccine and thought it was that she wasn&#39;t eating enough food on Friday. She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

                                                Only initial side effect following both injections was moderately sore arm and fatigue.  Following 2nd dose I experienced 1 episode of severe vertigo while just sitting doing nothing. Dizziness cleared completely in about 4 minutes.  Then on March 13th, was at work, sitting at desk and same thing happened again. After the dizziness cleared I got up and went to see a patient. I work in a rehab unit of a hospital.  Got pt approx 50 feet down the hallway when dizziness started coming back. Handed patient over to other staff. I took my blood pressure and checked my blood sugar. Both WNL . Dizziness never got better. Went to ER. They had no clue of cause. All labs were normal. Saw Physical therapist who performed Eply maneuver as well as a ENT. Both got same result. Negative for BPPV.  MD gave me Antivert. Didn&#39;t work.  Are waiting to be seen in May 2021 for NVT test and another with Neurologist. In the meantime the dizziness has remained constant rendering me unable to return to work.

States when she got old things shifted and changed. One ENT said she has neuritis, where something hit her ear nerve in right ear.

On 01APR2021, she could feel rush of pressure to back of head, tunnel vision, cloudy and pressure in her ears and was dizzy. Hx of Hashimoto&#39;s - autoimmune disorder, vestibular issue, concerns with getting the second one (dose). Read about adverse reactions and dizziness was on the list of severe reactions. The instant, within a minute, patient could feel this happening to her, she instantly could feel she becoming dizzy, light headed, out of body experience like floating. (didn&#39;t mention this in report) felt like walking on air. While sitting and chit chatting with other people to distract myself. Patient didn&#39;t have any anxiety. She will admit she was reluctant to get the vaccine because of my health problems.  She was more concerned, she instantly got a headache with the pressure, when she was leaving, she felt her eyes feel weird, almost like an allergy issue, burning, not quite burning either. Kind of like a burning, not quite like a burning, felt like when you walk into the wind that has lots of pollen,  that feeling. She didn&#39;t walk out side, she was inside when this happened, the pressure was already starting, no headache in front of head, it was in back of my skull, at top of her neck and pressure within the ears and ache and pressure on back of her head. Not dizzy, not like when you are in the hospital and they give she something and patient can&#39;t walk, or where you tried to stand and you couldn&#39;t , it was more like light headed, like walking on air like. It lasted all yesterday. As the night progressed by 10PM or 11PM her arm started to really hurt, patient took Tylenol and went to bed, took Xanax as she did and slept, woke up fine. This morning it felt like she wanted to have a headache but haven&#39;t had it since. It&#39;s almost like patient had intracranial pressure, because she had these conditions, so she read a lot. Investigation Assessment was No. States she is calling to report a potentially strange side effect. She states as soon as she got the injection, approximately within one-two minutes, she could feel a rush to the back of her head and the lower part of her head which then made her feel like she had somewhat of her vision clouded, like a tunnel vision. Clarifies her vision was clouded on the sides but she could see forward. Caller states that she was not dizzy like falling over and she does have vestibular migraines and vertigo issues, but she had that feeling of dizziness and when she got up and walked, it felt like she was walking on a cloud. Clarifies she felt a heavy pressure in the back of her head. States as soon as the injection was over, she could feel it. States she is concerned regarding the second dose because of her autoimmune and vestibular conditions. She states is caused immediate pressure in her ears. States that could&#39;ve affected her and put her into a migraine, she doesn&#39;t know. States a friend said jeez you should report that and she read more on the list of side effects and saw something about an allergic reaction and dizziness, and she did have some sort of adverse reaction. States she doesn&#39;t know and it is concerning to her. States she is doing fine today, other than a little headache that comes and comes. States it was bizarre with the  clouded, not cloudy, but tunnel vision. States she does not want to release any medical records; she declines for now to provide. She states CVS administered it, not her doctor. States she is going to discuss it with him. States she doesn&#39;t want to have a worse reaction with the second dose. Caller states a headache is a headache but the pressure she felt within one minute and continuing it concerns her on the second one with the larger dose. States she is also concerned with the second dose if dizziness is a severe allergic reaction, not saying she  fell over and wiped out. Patient wondering if that was an allergic reaction. States as the evening went on and she took Tylenol, it improved. States the dizziness improved as the night went on but had a bizarre feeling when she went to bed. States her arm was sore in the evening and is still sore to the touch. Clarifies that her eyes felt funny. States like walking through a stream of pollen, not that she had itchy eyes, but it felt like she had been effected by something. States it was not like a tired and burning feeling, states she can&#39;t explain it but something felt like had an allergy type situation if she has a problem with seasonal allergies. Treatment included took Tylenol. States when someone has an autoimmune issue they have a lot of issues regarding the stomach and take a lot of vitamins and supplements. Caller states she wants to report she has a lot of food sensitivities and environmental sensitivities because of her Hashimotos. States anything can set off an immune response. States what happens with that is she would get on her face, angioedema near her ears and the gland secretes and the passage way swells up. States she takes Pepcid AC to treat it. States this did not happen with her first vaccine. States she was very hesitant on taking the vaccine because knows she has these issues and she didn&#39;t want to have adverse reactions. States that her reaction to the first vaccine potentially concerns her for the second dose. States going to speak with the medical information department is a good idea. States the location she received her vaccine was very busy. States they did a nice and good job on getting people in. States the girl administering it did good, but she didn&#39;t mention unless you knew you had to wait 15 minutes due to possible adverse reactions, they didn&#39;t really check on people. States she just had to do whatever and she didn&#39;t know whether or not to report it then because she was not in distress. States she thought she just has to get home and drove 30 miles. All events (AEs) did not require a visit to Emergency Room nor Physician Office. The events of Tunnel vision, rush of pressure to back of head and the lower part of head, Headache, dizzy/Dizziness/light headed, cloudy and pressure in her ears/Ear Pressure, was recovered on 01Apr2021, of my arm started to really hurt/Sore Arm; sore to touch was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4; was not able to walk at first; her arm was cold; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 63-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 08:00 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included high blood pressure that was diagnosed 2-3 years ago, diabetes; she was prediabetic, heart;cholesterol has been high for about 30 years; since she was in her 30s; all from an unknown date and ongoing. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 63-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no prior vaccination in four weeks. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin taken for blood cholesterol and takes 20mg once a day prior to stroke and in the hospital they increased it to 40mg once a day and ongoing; ramipril taken for blood pressure and she was prescribed with this medication for a while prior to her stroke. It was discontinued in the hospital. Stated that she did not take it everyday because she was allergic to it; and sitagliptin (JANUVIA [SITAGLIPTIN]) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing and stated that she has been taking for quite a while. On 24Feb2021 she had her second shot. She said that everything was fine that morning; that afternoon her arm was sore. Stated she thought nothing of it. That evening she entertained guest. They were saying she sounded different; they said her speech sounded slurred. She had gotten her vaccine at around 08:00. Again, she didn&#39;t think anything about her speech. On 25Feb2021, she got up and did some laundry going up and down the steps. Stated that it was difficult because her arm was still sore. She cleaned the house. At around 15:30 she was doing bills and noticed that her writing looked like a baby&#39;s scribble. On 26Feb2021, she noticed that her left arm was weak and was told by her doctor to go to the Emergency Room where they told her she had a stroke. She added that it seemed like her arm was cold for a number of weeks. Stated she was the type to wear t-shirts in the winter because she was always hot. During those weeks she was wearing heavy clothes and was under blankets. She was just now starting to feel more like herself and not so cold all the time. The patient was unable to recall time frame when this symptom began. The events did require a visit to emergency room and physician office. The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to the events from 26Feb2021 to 01Mar2021. During hospitalization, the patient saw a cardiologist, neurologist, her primary care provider, and the hospitalists who all said it was very suspicious that her stroke happened right after her vaccine. Before she got her second vaccine, she was doing embroidery and everything she normally does; nothing was wrong. They did a CAT Scan that showed nothing. Then the MRI of the brain showed a Pontine Stroke on 26Feb2021. Cardiologist put a heart monitor on her and could not find anything. They were looking for A-Fib or something like that when she was on the heart monitor in the hospital; but it never showed anything irregular. She had a loop recorder implanted to monitor her heart and they haven&#39;t found anything wrong on it. She had heart tests, carotid artery tests, ultrasound of her heart and nothing was found on those tests. They pretty much told her in the hospital that they couldn&#39;t find a reason for her stroke. She kept asking about the vaccine. They did not rule it out as a cause, but they also did not say it was the cause. All the doctors said they could not pin her stroke on the vaccine. They stated it was suspicious and that they had seen 2-3 other patients with a similar situation. One of the doctor&#39;s told her he would not rule it out. They did an ultrasound of her carotids and heart and did not find anything on those tests that would have caused her stroke. She was having lasting effects related to her stroke. Her arm was still sore at times, stated it was a different kind of sore and could be related to all the therapy she does now. The lingering effects after stroke was reported as she was not able to walk at first. She&#39;s been doing therapy focused on her left side. Stated that her left side was the dominant side and she cannot write or type. She couldn&#39;t do the report online due to the difficulty with typing. She wanted to make sure this was reported. The patient has been doing therapy for 7 weeks, twice a day; and stated she likely still has months more of therapy to try and get her left side back to normal. She said that simple daily duties are difficult. The patient also stated that she was prediabetic before her hospitalization with her number (A1c) usually being 6.5-6.8. She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4. She doesn&#39;t know what made it go up. Then states she doesn&#39;t know if the vaccine made it go up or not. She has a follow up with the neurologist soon. The patient also reported medications she has been taking since her stroke and hospitalization; but not prior to her vaccine which included Amlodipine-Benazepril:  5-20mg once a day and Aspirin: 325mg once a day. The patient stated that stroke and heart problems do not run in her family. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer&#39;s COVID Vaccine; lot number: EL1284; expiration date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration left upper arm on Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included lupus. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she got her first dose of the COVID Vaccine 2 weeks ago today (Jan2021), and this is her second dose next Saturday. She was a non-medicated, non-kind of remission level of lupus. She mentioned that she was okay the second day, she thinks. She had a little dizziness, fatigue and light headedness that kind of thing. But the top 3 or 4 days ago, so like on her 8th or 9th day, she started to get like inflammatory symptoms like arthritis pain in her hip, in her hand, in her wrist. It was also reported that the patient experienced inflammatory pain on an unspecified date. So, she was just wondering if there are any reports of people with lupus and if the other people have reported that. She mentioned that she wanted to get the second dose but was a little concerned if those arthritis symptoms are going to be worse. No treatment was received. The causality was reported as yes. The patient she hasn&#39;t gone visit any emergency room/ physician&#39;s office for the adverse events. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                COVID- 19 Vaccine. She was experiencing chest tightness, SOB, and dizziness. 50mg of Benadryl and 20mg of famotidine was administered around 1410. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3mg of epinephrine was administered at 1420. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse ox 100%, HR 68, BP 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care.  Pt seen in Emergency Room 1/16/2021 1513 CHIEF COMPLAINT: reaction to COVID vaccine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 64y F with PMHx significant for Myopericarditis, Anxiety and HTN who presents to ER after developing tongue swelling, wheezing, tunneled vision and shortness of breath. Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl. This did not help and actually made her symptoms worse. She recalls wheezing. She was given another pill of what she believes was Benadryl. She also recalls pharmacist measured her BP and her husband, who was present, reported that her blood pressure was in the 140s This did not improve so she was given 0.3mg IM epinephrine shot. This significantly improved her symptoms. However, she was sent to ER.  She denies any hx of recent UTI or GI infection. She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.

I experienced two bouts of extreme dizziness, within minutes of each other.  I did not go to the hospital nor did I call 911.  My husband helped me to my bed where I went to bed and slept off and on for over two hours. I felt well enough to eat lunch, then went back to bed, where I slept for three hours.  No more episodes of dizziness occurred.

I had joint and body aches. I experienced lightheadedness when I got up when fever was 101.8 at 2:30 pm.  I had to lay down again and apply a wet towel. Once I felt able to walk (about 10 minutes later) I ate a popsicle and then proceeded to take two 325 mg of Tylenol. Within 30 to 45 minutes fever subsided. I then ate soup, crackers and an orange and drank cranapple juice. I went back to bed and slept some more. I woke up at 5 pm and had a cup of soup, a quarter of an apple and gatorade. At 9 pm I took two more Tylenol to be safe and when to sleep. Sunday I was fine. My arm, never was swollen only a little sore.

                                                Sore arm immediately after getting second dose of COVID Vaccine; Chills; Myalgia; severe headache; Nausea; She felt like she had a temperature and by the time it was checked her temperature was 101.9/febrile; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP) reporting for herself.  A 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 07Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital, not a Military Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient got the Flu Vaccine last part of Sep2020 or Beginning of Oct2020. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EK57530), via an unspecified route of administration at left Upper arm on 17Dec2020 9:10AM for covid-19 immunization. She only had a sore arm. It started the same day, a couple of hours after getting the vaccine. It went away a day to a day and a half after it started. After that she was fine. She got the second dose on 07Jan2021. After the second dose, immediately, like within five minutes her arm became very sore, this event was assessed as non-serious by HCP. Also, that Thursday (07Jan2021) night after getting the second dose of the Vaccine around 9PM-10PM she started to get chills, myalgia, severe headache, and nausea. She also mentioned she was so sick during the night she was not able to get up and around. She felt like she had a temperature and by the time it was checked her temperature was 101.9. She was febrile all through 08Jan2021. She started to become afebrile 09Jan2021 with improvement and by 10Jan2021 all her symptoms had gone away and completely resolved. Seriousness Criteria: Stated she felt these are serious. She was unable to go to work on Friday. She could not return back to work until Monday. The HCP assessed all events were related to the vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021. She stated, even though she got so sick with getting the vaccine she was just continuously telling her self this is better than having COVID. She stated she even told people even if she knew after getting the shot she would have this reaction she would still take it. She has seen death occur from COVID and does not want that to happen.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, clinical course and known safety profile of the product, the reported events chills, myalgia, severe headache, nausea and fever were likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3302), intramuscular (left arm), on 20Jan2021 09:00, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies: penicillin, sulfa, environmental. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY); calcium; and colecalciferol (VIT D3). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EJ1685), on 30Dec2020 16:00, intramuscular (left arm), for covid-19 immunization at 64-years-old. The patient experienced, &#34;10-11 hr&#34; post injection, on 20Jan2021 20:00 started shaking chills lasting 10 hours. The patient also experienced on 20Jan2021 20:00 severe frontal headache with nausea and intermittent dizziness, muscle pain, joint pain, and fatigue - which all resolved after about 24 hr after onset. No treatment was received for these adverse events. The patient recovered from all the events on 21Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and have not been COVID tested post vaccination.

                                                37 hours after Pfizer injection,  experienced severe abdominal pain that caused me to have vasovagal syncope.  Started sweating, and I lost my vision, then must have fallen on the floor.   When I came to, felt very headachy and nauseous.   went to urgent care - they ordered an abdominal scan for 2/8/21 but scan did not reveal the cause of the pain.  8 hours later on 2/5/21, started feeling asthma like symptoms.  Throat felt tight, voice became hoarse, kept having to cough because airway was starting to feel thickened.   went to ER, they took vitals and told me that i wasn&#39;t having  an allergic reaction because my symptoms were outside the time frame for an allergic reaction.  After 3 hours there, they sent me home.  Next morning felt like I was having heart palpitations. that feeling eventually went away if I walked around.  But the following two mornings, I had the same feeling.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Around noontime I vomited twice more.  I got worse, could not walk around.  I felt extremely sick but felt better when I lay down in bed.  I was not able to go to work, had to cancel the substitute teaching assignment I had taken.  I did sleep some. No doctor called me back except my daughter texted with me.  She is an intern, said she wished she could be with me.  My neighbor brought some Pedialyte.  This morning, the next day, I am still weak and nauseous, but it is less.  At the end of the day yesterday, I did eat a little rice with carrots.  And I just ate a little plain oatmeal with raisins and salt.  I am praying the 2nd dose will not be worse, as my daughter warned, because I can&#39;t remember when I was so sick and incapacitated.  Maybe a long time ago.

                                                I had my 2nd dose of covid vaccine on 1/15, around 5 pm.  Next day when I got up about 7:20 I felt dizzy nausea and wanted to vomit.  Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

                                                As the needle was being inserted and while the vaccine was being injected, I immediately felt intense pain like none I&#39;ve had during any prior vaccine administration . The needle was inserted very high on the arm about 1/2 inch below the shoulder.  About 4:00 pm that afternoon, new pain developed in the same shoulder, along with very limited range of motion, gradually worsening during next few hours. By 9:00pm the pain was excruciating, like there were multiple knives in all directions in my shoulder. By then I could not lift or move my arm any amount in any direction without excruciating pain.  I suspected a severe inflammatory response. This pain level continued for the next 2 days.  On the 3rd day the pain was a little less severe and I had slightly more range of motion, but was still unable to lift my arm without pain. On the 4th day (Feb. 18) the pain was a little better but I still had severe sharp pain if I lifted my arm in certain directions. I began to suspect a torn muscle or tendon. Today (March 5, almost 3 weeks after the vaccine), the pain and limited range of motion are the same as Feb. 18.  It is relieved only by complete rest of the arm, and easily aggravated by any basic activity (grocery shopping, dressing, etc.)  I believe my shoulder was injured by improper administration.

                                                One and a half hours after the  vaccine, I suddenly became very dizzy and had a hard time focusing. I was extremely happy that I was NOT driving.  I could not think straight and had sweat pouring down my face. My head was very heavy and as the day progressed, my neck also became sore. I took Advil and later Tylenol and they helped the head ache but not the dizziness. I lost appetite. I consulted the reading material about the vaccine and all of my symptoms were normal side effects, so I did not seek medical assistance. My daughter is a doctor and wanted me to report for statistical reasons.

Dizziness continued for 2 days. Neck pain improved somewhat but is still bothering me, woke me up at night. Now a week later and my neck still hurts.  I called my primary care office on March 3 and they said call 211. That made no sense so I asked again and they finally said I could see a nurse practitioner the next day. However I didn?t go because I couldn?t drive.  I am a little worried about the second dose.

I pulled over the car, and then I was shacking. I opened the window to get some fresh air, and drunk water. I could not moved or do anything.  I waited in my car for over 20 minutes hoping that I would feel better. I was still feeling weak and shacking. Finally a member of my family came to pick me up. and took me back to the church which was less than one mile.  I explained the situation, they told me that they did not have a doctor on premise and to contact my primary care physician or to go to an emergency care facility. I started to shack less. So  the member of my family took me back home and I just relaxed while I had chills for two hours.

I sat immediately because I felt I was about to faint. I waited 20 min for the dizziness to diminish and was able to walk by myself. My vision was blurry and felt my eyes were moving rapidly side to side. My husband drove me home because I still fell too dizzy to drive back home. The dizziness continued the day of the 2nd dose administration and got less bothersome if I stayed in bed. The following day the dizziness was much less but I still stayed in bed. Monday March 15 I also experienced dizziness and stayed in bed. Since the first dose on Feb 09, 21 I have felt tired and not always being able to complete my physical therapy routine. The tiredness is not every day. It comes and goes.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, Batch/Lot: EL9265) in right arm via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included osteoporosis, Inappropriate sinus tachycardia, known allergies. Concomitant medication included estradiol benzoate (ESTRADIOL [ESTRADIOL BENZOATE]), calcium (CALCIUM), ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]), naproxen (NAPROXEN), vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) all at once a day. The patient was not diagnosed with covid-19 before vaccination and covid was not tested post vaccination. The patient had the first vaccine on 08Feb (complete date not clarified), two days after that it had most of the side effects, with the one very sore arm, headache, fever chills, nausea, feeling very tired, about 6 days after that she tested positive for Covid and 6 days after the first vaccine. She tested positive for Covid so for the last couple of weeks. She had Covid, the fever broke about 5 to 6 days ago, she had a low grade fever after that, also the symptoms were gone now, there was little fatigue and little rash on back. She was scheduled to take second shot now and was trying to find in research about taking the second shot inspite of having covid. She cant find anything, most of the people never heard this and primary care physician said to go ahead and take the shot, but some people and some researchers said you should not, because she might have symptoms later and she should wait. The treatment was not received for the adverse events. Outcome of tested positive for Covid and 6 days was unknown and for other events it was recovering.

                                                Almost immediately I felt a tightening on the back of my neck.  It was familiar to me; I feel exactly that same symptom when I eat something with MSG.  Within minutes I felt light headed and exhausted.  I went to the pharmacist and he gave me Benadryl; I don&#39;t know the exact amount, but it was in the small cup that comes with different kinds of meds.  It made no difference, so I had to call my husband to pick me up.  I was very, very tired so I slept for the next 3 hours.  I went back to bed 2 hours later and slept through the night.  I was up the next day and by 11 am was very tired; I slept for 4 hours, then again through the night.  By the next day, I felt normal.

                                                After 10 minutes of receiving shot I felt a cold surge in my left arm and  felt lightheaded. I felt sweaty, weak and faint. The EMTs quickly came to my side and administered my blood pressure and oximeter. When I continued to feel lightheaded they took me to a back room and hooked me up to an EKG with electrodes throughout my body. They retook my blood pressure and told me that my blood pressure had risen to 180/90 earlier! After sitting for a while they took it again and read 160/80. They told me to get it checked again, asked if I need go to ER, Walk-in or doctor. They walked me out to my husband, who was waiting in car. I went home and slept for 11/2 hours. Took my blood pressure the next day 3 times and averaged in the low 120s.

                                                Pfizer -BioNTech COVID-19Vaccine EUA  About 10 minutes after having the shot, I had a rush to my head and a feeling of being faint, followed by a rapid heartbeat.  This subsided after a few minutes, but the rapid heartbeat seemed to remain for hours.  It felt like a low blood sugar attack.  I had not eaten a proper breakfast before having this shot and I am wondering if that had something to do with it.  I want to make sure I can have the second shot if I eat well before I go and have hydration with me.  I waited an extra 10 minutes and got out to my car and ate some nuts and drank water.  Felt like I had too much caffeine the rest of the day.

I also had tingling and pain in the other arm from the wrist up to my neck. The medics took me into a room to lie down for 30 minutes and it seemed to pass. I have felt off and foggy for the past 3 weeks. And now for the past 3 days, I have been feeling the same feeling of lightheadedness and dizziness that I had after the shot throughout every day. I am sure this is related to the vaccine. I never had anything like this in my life. I did not take the second shot and still feel awful.  I have spoken to people who had the same immediate allergic reaction.

I am sure later I had a TIA. Was unable to communicate. I knew what I wanted to say but I could not get the words out. March 1/2021   I went on FLMA. It never dawned on me the vaccine could have affected my already stressed heart. I am still experiencing these symptoms. I just thought of this this week. I still have extreme fatigue, increased palpitations,  and increased SOB. I do not feel able to work right now.

                                                headache; dizziness; chest was tight; was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days; wheezing; bad pressure in the back of her head; felt like her heart was skipping beats; heart rate and blood pressure seem to be very erratic; erratic heartrate; arm swelled up and was sore; arm swelled up and was sore; lump in throat; unwell feeling all over like she was going to pass out.; unwell feeling all over like she was going to pass out.; She kept getting an icky feeling; The initial safety information received was reporting only non-serious adverse drug reaction(s), Upon receipt of follow-up information on [26Mar2021], this case now contains serious adverse reaction(s). Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (one is patient). A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6204), intramuscular, administered in right arm on 08Mar2021 14:10 (at the age of 64-year-old) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included high cholesterol, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, arthritis, stenosis of neck and spine, allergies to dust and cleaners (when she cleans, the bottom of her neck swells up huge); all were ongoing. She has very high cholesterol, she believes it was close to 400 the last time it was checked and that&#39;s why she was given Repatha which brought it way down, but she doesn&#39;t know if she can take the Repatha again. She also has quite a few allergies - allergic to cats, sulfa, grass and Pre-diabetes. She has a fair amount of allergies. Her doctor thinks she has some asthma because she has had a little trouble breathing at different times, but she doesn&#39;t have an inhaler or anything. She mentions asthma and allergies run in her family. The patient also stated that a majority of her life, has had low blood pressure until about 9 years ago when her father passed. States that her blood pressure had been out of control for 6 months and was then put on a low dose of Carvedilol, and eventually evened out. Concomitant medications included ongoing carvedilol taken for blood pressure; ongoing loratadine (CLARITIN) taken for allergies from 1996 (has been taking for 25 years); ongoing lansoprazole taken for acid reflux; ongoing rosuvastatin calcium taken for cholesterol since Sep2020; ongoing calcium; carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure. The patient had a previous reaction to a cholesterol medication evolocumab (REPATHA) from 23Oct2020 to 23Oct2020 - her neck swelled up pretty big and she had hives on her chest, which ended up going away. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if she can take that again or not. The patient also previously took rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) 5-6 months ago and it made her legs ache really bad; esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) and had the problem; lansoprazole (PREVACID) for acid reflux. She took Nexium which was a different product with different ingredients and her blood pressure was still high the whole day. States that her doctor had prescribed another brand, which had the same main ingredient as the Nexium, and told her to double up on it one night, so she did that and about an hour later she just about hit the floor because her blood pressure shot up to about 200 over 100 and something, so she talked to the pharmacist who said that this was not a normal reaction to the ingredients in Nexium, but it happened to her every time she took it. She had been taking Prevacid for a long time but then started to get an allergic reaction. Clarified that feeling like she was having an allergic reaction after taking the Prevacid at night, was something that she has just started noticing within the last month. Wondering if the 2nd dose of the Prevacid is too much. States that she still takes this in the morning but not in the evening. States that she has started taking 15mg at night from an over the counter version of the same medicine (Lansoprazole). She explained that she hasn&#39;t had any vaccines as an adult, she never has had a flu shot. About 5 years ago, she had a bat in the house for 3 days and the bat ended up hitting her in the head and forehead as they were trying to get the bat out of the house, so she ended up getting a rabies vaccine. She was wondering and hoping there were no interactions with that. With the rabies vaccine, she did have a headache. She had to get 4 or 5 shots and she did not feel well most of the time. It took a long time to pass for her to feel normal again. The caller received the first dose of the vaccine last Monday on 08Mar2021, after the shot and while waiting those 30 minutes, she felt a lump in her throat which lasted all day and the next day, but it went away. She confirms by 10Mar2021, she recovered completely. Her arm swelled up and was sore for a day and half on 08Mar2021, but that went away. She isn&#39;t worried about that. She also has a really bad headache and was very dizzy on unspecified dates. She is concerned about the dizziness. She has been driving, but about the second day after getting the vaccine, she was leaning over talking to her mom and she felt like she going to pass out. She didn&#39;t, but she felt like she was. She has been using hot packs. It&#39;s like she has a headache around her temples and the back of her head seems to be hurting. In fact, she put a hot pack there while waiting to speak to this call handler. She doesn&#39;t know if its tension or what. She didn&#39;t have hives or none of that from COVID vaccine which she was excited about, but she is so dizzy she can hardly stand. She can&#39;t get rid of the headache and dizziness. She wants to know whether or not to go ahead with the next vaccination. This is the 5th day of having this dizziness. She was thinking the dizziness was going to last for a couple of days, but its going on 5 days. Even just sitting, She states it&#39;s kind of scaring her. She was thinking it would just go away, but it isn&#39;t. Her heart rate and blood pressure seemed to be very erratic on 12Mar2021. She woke up this morning (12Mar2021) and her blood pressure was very high, but she checked it within a few minutes and was dropping low. Her heart goes fast and then slows down, but she has had problems with this in the past. The dizziness has been bothering her a lot, she has been afraid to drive. The patient had a blood pressure of 150/102 on unspecified date.  On 17Mar2021, She mentioned she will see her HCP at 2:00 PM. She has already filed a report regarding the side effects she had. She filed a report and asked if she should get the second dose shot. However, she was informed if her HCP called, they may be able to provide her with more information. She was informed her HCP could call the medical line. On 26Mar2021, she stated that the first report was filed the first week and that during the second week, more not good things have been happening. She wrote down the report number from the first report but does not have it now. Since the vaccine, she has been having different symptoms; she is not sure if it is related to the vaccine but wanted to report it. She was a little concerned because she has allergies, stating she had just tried an injectable cholesterol drug and she did break out hives and her neck had swelled. States that she has not had any vaccines as an adult, so she was a little bit cautious anyway. She clarified that she did not have hives and did not have any breathing problems when she left. Stated that later that evening and the next day had a really bad headache and bad pressure in the back of her head, which she knew was typical. States that 3 or four times she felt a rush over her body and felt like she was going to pass out. That night and the next day (unspecified date), she was having breathing problems (was not breathing very well for 3- 4 days) and her chest was tight and she was starting to wheeze, and continued for about 3 or 4 days. She kept getting an icky feeling Monday and Friday when she got up and had unwell feeling all over like she was going to pass out on unspecified date in Mar2021.

States that she went to the ER to check everything out last Thursday.  Every night since then, somewhere around 8 o&#39;clock, her blood pressure spikes really high.  Stated she then called her doctor.

This 64-year-old female patient reported for herself that she received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/lot number: ER8731) via an unspecified route in the left arm on 18Apr2021 at 12:15 (at the age of 64-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included tick bite, blood pressure, nerve pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and sciatica. The patient had no family history. The patient had no other prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) of the COVID vaccine. Ongoing concomitant medications included olmesartan for blood pressure, duloxetine for nerve pain, omeprazole for GERD, famotidine for GERD; all taken for years, meloxicam for sciatica taken for 2 months and ongoing and doxycycline from 16Apr2021 and ongoing for tick bite (reported that she kept forgetting to take it). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8727) on 28Mar2021 at 12:00 in the left arm as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. That dose went in the deltoid and she had no issues. Then she received the second dose on 18Apr2021 at 12:15 in the left arm. She believes it was administered in the soft tissue behind the deltoid. She noticed the person who gave the injection went behind the muscle toward the back of the arm. The next day after the second dose, she felt fine. Then the second morning it felt as if her shoulder was dislocated; and her breast is hard and painful; and she can&#39;t breath. She called her doctor who said that was not a common side effect but she stated she knows it is a side effect. The doctor recommended she go to the ER but patient didn&#39;t want to go. She stated that she doesn&#39;t know if missing the muscle is going to let the medication absorb or if it has penetrated the soft tissue. The clinical course of events was further described as follows: On 20Apr2021 at 08:00, the second morning, she woke up and felt severe pain in her right breast and shoulder all the way to back; adds she can&#39;t move her arm and her breast is so painful she can&#39;t touch it and her shoulder is immobile. She is also having very bad shortness of breath, adds she thought that may be from anxiety; so later in the day she took a alprazolam (XANAX). She added that she put up with the pain all morning and thought maybe she was working herself up so she took one half of a Xanax to calm down, to see if it was just anxiety but the shortness of breath and pain were still there. She reported she was continuing to feel all of these effects at the same level. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the ER because of the expense. The shoulder pain was going down her back to the trapezius. She clarified that she can move her shoulder and her arm, but the pain was so breathtaking that she doesn&#39;t move it and she has her arm in a sling. There were no relevant tests performed. The clinical outcome of the events right breast pain, breast is hard, shoulder pain, shoulder pain going down her back, shortness of breath, can&#39;t move shoulder/arm/ shoulder is immobile, and anxiety was not recovered. The patient mentioned that she doesn&#39;t know if not getting the shot in the deltoid caused her symptoms or not.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                9 to 10 days after administration I started with left shoulder and bicep pain.  vaccine was given low in the arm and away from the joint so I did not get concerned at the beginning.  The pain has progressed despite range of motion exercises, ibuprofen, heat and topical steroid cream.  It has affected the use of my arm and I started myself on 30 mg of prednisone today with concern of SIRVA.  I am unable to seek any medical care at this time as I am driving my husband for cancer treatment and won&#39;t be home until Saturday the 9th of January.  I wanted to report these symptoms so if anyone else has similar symptoms it can be counted.

                                                my lower extremities went cold for an instant when they gave the vaccine but it quickly passed. Wait half an hour of post vaccination observation and it went well. On the return car the feeling of cold returned to me in my arms and legs. When I got home I felt good and I prepared something for lunch, when I started eating, around 3.30 pm (about an hour and a half after getting the vaccine) I started to feel bad, my heart was beating very strong and fast, I was gasping for air, dizzy. I used the oximeter and I saw that my heart rate was at 110 and kept going up and the oxygen was going down. I called 911 when the blood pressure monitor and oximeter reached the limit and started flashing, oxygen at 92 and pulses at 141. I thought I was dying. The 911 operator told me to lie down and wait for the paramedics and she stayed with me on the line. I also put ice on my chest. When they arrived my signs began to normalize. I can&#39;t quite remember what happened next that day.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 65 years. The patient did not have reactions with other immunizations except a severe reaction with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine when she was younger. She had seizures after receiving the MMR vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient mentioned she had a severe reaction. She described her adverse reaction by having intense headaches, having stroke-like symptoms in which she described as she cannot speak, having headaches, having numbness in her hands, face, and lips. She also felt exhausted. She also had some pain in her arm that she is not concerned about. She mentioned that she also has her vision affected, she couldn&#39;t drive, there were wavy lines all though her eyes. She started to have hallucinations such as seeing people that weren&#39;t there, seeing snow storms, and seeing things whipping throughout the wind. All the events started on 04Jan2021. She reported she was very sick in the hospital and is now getting well. However it was unknown if she was admitted to hospital (clarification pending). She wanted to know recommendations about the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine because with her experience, she is not comfortable having the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This consumer reported similar events in two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number and expiry date: not reported), intramuscular on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. Concomitant medication included vitamins nos. It was reported that both the patient and her husband received the Pfizer Vaccine on 10Jan2021; and they had reaction to it. They both both had bad arm swelling and pain. Her was worst she couldn&#39;t even lift or move her arm. At first, they just thought it was a reaction as they read reactions could be and then she started to get small cough but by Friday, her husband went and got tested and on Wednesday he was tested positive and this is after the vaccine and then he got the results and it said he was positive. So, Saturday, they both went and got tested, they did the rapid and they did what they call the PCR, and they both came positive for both of them and this was after they receive the first vaccine. So, she thought they need to know that they got sick and it was after the vaccine. The patient needed to ask a question as they were supposed to go for their second vaccine on 31Jan2021 and do they do it even though they got sick. They knew they were claiming that they can&#39;t get sick because of the vaccine but it&#39;s very ironic that they did get this. They had been following CBC guidelines, both her husband and the patient because they are older and they wear mask all the time and they did everything they needed to and they could not understand how they got this. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Rapid and PCR: positive in Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of &#34;bad arm swelling and pain; worst she couldn&#39;t even lift or move her arm&#34; which included treatment with Tylenol. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021092094 same reporter and drug, similar events in a different patient

Awoke at 3:40 am and rolled off of arm where injection given and a wave of pain and nausea and malaise overwhelmed me. I passed completely out still lying in bed (so out that I wet myself in bed) and gradually came to, still feeling horrible. Got up, changed clothes, and major chills when I returned to bed. Around 6am I felt nauseous, got up to vomit, but instead passed completely out on the bathroom floor for about 15 minutes.  Remainder of day I felt very stiff, low energy and slightly woozy. By afternoon, energy was returning (I vacuumed the house). Minimal pain in arm this time compared to previous.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 17Jan2021 (at the age of 65-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Breast cancer in 2003 or 2004, for which the patient was in three clinical trials following that time. The patient reported that she requested to have the vaccine administered into her right arm because she is a breast cancer survivor. The patient has no concomitant medications.  The patient confirmed that she did not have any other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine.

On 21Jan2021 at around 03:00, the patient was nauseous and when the patient tried to get out of bed, the patient felt like the  &#34;whole world tilted on her&#34;. The patient reported the same thing continued a few times when she tried to get up, she just couldn&#39;t because everything turned upside down. So the patient went back to sleep, and she got up at 11:00AM, and she feels much better now, and now she is just having a little bit of remaining queasiness, like she can&#39;t go on a run right now, she is not 100%.  The patient inquired if these are known side effects of the product. The patient also reported that she that she used to be 6&#39;2 but she thinks she has shrunk a little from an unknown date. The patient stated that her PCP was not aware that she received the vaccine. The clinical outcome of the sore arm was recovered on 19Jan2021.  The clinical outcome of the nauseous/she is still just a little queasy, tried to get out of bed, and the whole world tilted on her, and thinks she has shrunk a little was unknown.

HAD BEEN SITTING THERE FOR ABOUT 4 OR 5 MINUTES SO HAPPY IT WAS OVER AND WE WOULD BE LEAVING SOON. THEN SUDDENLY AN INDESCRIBABLE SENSATION HIT ME LIKE A BRICK.  I FELT AS IF I LOST MY SENSE OF REALITY.   MAYBE AKIN TO ONE BEGINNING TO FAINT.  CANNOT DESCRIBE IT ? VISION AND HEARING AFFECTED SUDDENLY ? LIKE THINGS CLOSING IN ON ME.  THEN FELT A SENSATION IN MY CHEST AROUND BOTH LUNG AREAS WHICH TRAVELED UP MY NECK.  I SAT DEBATING WITH MYSELF WHETHER TO MAKE A SCENE AND CALL FOR HELP VERSUS TELLING MYSELF IT WOULD BE OKAY.  IT TOOK ABOUT 7 MINUTES BEFORE I COULD RELAX AND NOT BE TERRIFIED OF WHAT JUST HAD HAPPENED TO ME.  I NOTICED A SCRATCHY SENSATION ON THE BACK OF MY TONGUE.  GLAD HUSBAND WAS DRIVING BECAUSE I WAS SLIGHTLY DIZZY FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  IT WAS TERRIFYING AND I DO NOT WANT TO GET INJECTION #2.

                                                Second COVID vaccine on 1/14/21 - The patient is  received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine at Hospital.   Post dose she experienced intermittent sensation of tingling on left posterior neck area with no paresthesia and difficulty lifting bilateral extremities.  Three days after administration of the vaccine she began noticing weakness in her legs that eventually progressed to her arms bilaterally.   She developed pitting edema and SOB.   Per infectious disease MD, the main suspicion is for GBS Guillain-Barre Syndrome given exam findings. Pt&#39;s weakness and resulting inability to ambulate may have pushed pt into CHF exacerbation.   Patient received 3 days of IVIG which was discontinued due to worsening mental status.   Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.

Experienced myalgia  and severe migraine-like headache with light sensitivity. The arm pain from shoulder to mid-palm was so severe that I couldn?t lift my arm. This resolved by approximately noon on 02/10/2021. The other symptoms largely resolved by midday 02/11/2021 wit residual low-grade headache, dizziness, and unsteadiness on my feet.  I woke up on 02/11/2021 around 7AM with left axillary lymphadenopathy approximately the size of a tennis ball cut in half with associated moderate discomfort. The discomfort resolved by 02/14/2021, but the lymphadenopathy remains at about half the mass noticed originally.

She felt like her feet were in cinderblocks.  She took some Tylenol, and woke up at 4:00 AM and had two severe headaches and nausea since Sunday.  That night she felt as though she could not stand it any longer.  Went to UC and they tested her for the virus which was negative, and still having symptoms.  She thought the symptoms would get less, but it has been quite a few days.  She takes a short walk and the intense pain in her arms, and legs are terrible.   Her PCP told her that there was nothing they could do, and what she had been doing what she needed to do.  They also told her to go back to UC if she did not improve.

She did not have trouble breathing or swallowing and no itchiness or rash. The patient was given Benadryl and Zyrtec. She continued to be slightly dizzy and was taken to the emergency department for monitoring. Workup in the ED was negative. The patient was discharged home.

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                I had injection site discomfort, about 4-6 hours after vaccination. I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

I am not sure it was related to the injection. It resolved on sat Feb 20th 2021.  I still have mild nausea but am on Ozempic which gives me nausea some of the time. I did not feel well but finally fell asleep and slept until AM.

Went home from work that evening around 9:30 p.m. I Vomited as soon as I got home.  Felt better but still lightheaded, dizzy, not as bad.  No fever. Couldn&#39;t sleep. Tuesday, February 23 felt pretty weak, tired some lingering lightheadedness. Stayed home from work.  Next day, Wednesday, my right arm around the injection site was pretty sore. Hard to sleep  last night. Took Tylenol for arm. Still somewhat sore today,  Thursday.

She then had a rash that started on the left side of her neck, went towards the back now.  This started a few days after the vaccine, all on the left side.  She also got a cold sore on her lip which she had all the time as a child, but not as an adult, which has pretty much resolved.  She has been cold, chills and some dizzy spells.  She did get a bump on her head concussion in December.  One day last week she just stayed on the sofa with a blanket due to feeling poorly.  3 days ago on her back by her shoulder blade an area has been really sore.  She did take some Tylenol for the back pain which did not help so she stopped this.   She did not call her doctor.    The rash is still there but not as intense.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 11:30 at single dose (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included costochondritis, vertigo, autoimmune disease, uses a walker, inflammation of the cartilage between the rib and sternum and pulled muscle. Concomitant medications included methylprednisolone (MEDROL) (also reported as steroid pak) from Jan2021 to Jan2021 for pulled muscle and ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL) from Jan2021, both for inflammation of the cartilage between the rib and sternum. The patient previously took iodine and experienced allergies. It was reported that the patient just got the first Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine yesterday, 25Jan2021, 11:30 am. Last night, at 19:00, she had weakness on the left side of the body, especially in the thigh, and she fell down 3 times last night. Her leg was so weak she could not get up. She just got off the phone with the doctors office and was told to report this. The patient did not received therapy for the events weakness in left thigh and leg/leg was so weak she could not get up and Fell down 3 times. On 26Jan2021, the patient experienced didn&#39;t feel well last night. She was also on a Medrol pack about a week ago and just finished her last dose last night when she took the vaccine. The nurse practitioner at the doctor&#39;s office was wondering if it could have been an interaction between the Medrol pack and the vaccine. She got an email saying she could get the vaccine, but didn&#39;t think to call the doctor office to ask about the Medrol pack (steroid pack) or if it could cause any interactions. So the office told her to call. Later mentions along with the Medrol pack, she got an injection in the office of Toradol and this was before getting the vaccine.  She stated that she did have her on a steroid pack for a pulled muscle so that may have exacerbated the issue. The weakness and things have improved so she was still a little nervous and uses a walker and just making sure to take it easy today. The patient had no other vaccines in 4 weeks and other medications in two weeks included steroid Pak. Patient had no problems with vaccines in the past. The patient had no Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The patient had no events following prior vaccinations. Patient stated that they had been lucky and they have been tested before and has not had it yet, so that was why they wanted to get the vaccine done. She just rested and her husband helped her to bed since she didn&#39;t feel well last night. She did not have any trouble breathing. Patient underwent a Chest x-ray in Jan2021 and nothing showed up on it, but just some old calcifications from many years ago. That was done sometime last week and she also had like 3 MRI&#39;s on an unspecified date. Patient was wondering if she should she get the second dose. Her next appointment was on 16Feb2021. She was pretty banged up and does not want to have to go through that again. Outcome of events was recovering.

Symptoms resolved with food, water, and time Second Reaction: About 36 hours later while doing dishes, felt prickly on both sides of my neck. Both sides of my neck turned pink as though I had a sunburn. Broke out in profuse sweating.  Called my doctor who was on call that night. He told me to get Benadryl  right away and to keep taking it until symptoms subsided. If they did not subside or got worse I was to go to urgent care, or ER. Treatment: Benadryl every 4-6 hours for 2 days. As each dose wore off I waited to see if the symptoms came back and then took more Benadryl. Issue lasted until Saturday night - 2 days.

                                                Six days after receiving my second vaccine at a mass drive-thru site (on 2/25), I experienced plugged ears -- a feeling of congestion, pressure and mild pain. Then three days after that, on 2/28, I became dizzy and nauseous, causing vomiting and a feeling that I may faint. My husband took me to Urgent Care where I was diagnoses with BPPV and prescribed meclizine and ondansetron. I have been doing the Epley maneuver and my condition has improved somewhat, but I still feel fatigued and the pressure in my ears has not subsided. I cannot hear correctly out of my left ear. I am concerned that I now have Meniere&#39;s disease, which can be caused by &#34;abnormal immune response&#34; -- the vaccine? I have an appointment with an ENT specialist on 3/25 and hopefully can get some answers at that time.

This helped and it subsided within the 15 minute wait when we left the vaccination site. My head continued to feel a little woozy and the hard fast heartbeat returned with the headache three more times throughout the day with last one around 5:30pm. Next day just felt washed out.

I have never taken a flu vaccine, my body has a pretty great immune system, but I did this vaccine &#34; mostly, for the good of the whole&#34;- I will think long and hard before I would take this vaccine again or recommend doing so to anyone else.

Started to black out and went down but not unconscious. Then bowel movement and nausea at same time and started dripping sweat profusely. Soaked my clothes. So weak could not get up or felt as though will pass out. Then got the chills and loud ringing in my ears. Whole episode lasted about 20-30 minutes then went to bed at 7:30 p.m. felt so exhausted and fatigued. Woke up about 4a.m. arm hurt but felt okay. Little off balance, fatigued, weak all day. Next day arm sore but improving. Now fine. Saw doctor today, he advised me to report and wait to see advice from Pfizer as to get2d dose or not.

I don?t take my bp,often, dr offices etc. 4 weeks ago, I felt pressure around eyes, in back of neck, weak, dizzy. My bp had spiked to 203/104, my husband called the ambulance. I went to ER. Bp went down, I came home, same thing happened the next day. Back in again.... Since then, I have had just about every test possible. I am perfectly healthy on paper. I just don?t know what to,do.... have now taken some bp meds and beta blocker. I can feel my bp spiking several times a day. 170/93 and then after a while back down again. I feel like I might be allergic to whatever is in my body. My hands and face tingle, I feel hot and then cold.  I am praying this will ease it way out after the vaccine wears off. Needless to,say I am super concerned. I have ALWAYs been very healthy, fit and happy with a busy life.

After my second dose I had chills, lethargy and severe joint and body pain (difficult to sleep) which improved after 36 hours--except worsening of left knee pain--by 3/5/21 I was unable to stand, walk or move my left knee due to pain.  I self treated with Naprosyn (400 mg bid) and went to urgent care on 3/6/21.  The XRAY was negative with slight effusion.  I have had no injuries or trauma to my leg. I am a physician and have had psoriasis and PsA for about 25 years--have on and off medical care (topical steriods, creams and NSAIDS).  Due to my &#43;BRCA2 gene I have not taken stronger immuno-suppressive therapies.

I didn&#39;t go to work (wasn&#39;t planning on it) and I didn&#39;t get up and I realized I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. I somehow got up and put leggings on and I couldn&#39;t stand up and I unlocked the door because a repair man was going to be coming to fix the dishwasher. I fell asleep after he left - he had to bring me my checkbook - never took my prednisone for the day - I had chills and fever all day. I had fever - 104. I had nausea, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea and my husband gave me 20 mg of steroids when he got home and two of my Florinef and two ice chips to swallow. He carried me upstairs - I was not cognizant of what was going on. I wasn&#39;t cognizant the whole day of Wednesday. He gave me soup later and more doses of steroids. I didn&#39;t have a fever - or else it was down to 100. I still had diarrhea, nausea, headaches, body aches and I only ate the BRAT diet. I couldn&#39;t go to the office Thursday or Friday. On Friday, I still had a horrible headache. I was still doubling up on my steroids that day as I still felt so horrible. That Friday night, I finally felt wonderful. But I had taken a lot steroid after all that.

                                                I was slightly dizzy about 5 minutes after but then was fine. 10 days later I was fatigued, dizzy, nauseous and had the chills. Body ache and fatigue only lasted a few days but the dizzy and nausea remained on and off for next few weeks. Today it has been 38 days later and the dizzy has subsided over past week but I continue to experience nausea on and off and this is very worrisome. Due to this I have not had the second shot because I feel unwell. I saw my primary doctor and did not find anything wrong.  I also have not heard of anyone who has had this same experience so I am scared to have the other shot even though I know I need it.  I just need some answers.  Thanks for responding.

                                                Extreme migraine. Head pain, neck pain, nausea, vomiting,, dizziness, overall weakness, light sensitivity.  I have migraine disease but since I began Aimovig injections nearly a year ago I have very few migraines,  Those I have had have been extremely mild, just headache usually relieved by otc meds. Additionally I have not had nausea and vomiting with any migraine episode for many years.  When I woke at yesterday morning, I was in extreme pain across the right side and back of my head and down to my neck and shoulders. 9 out 10. I took my prescription, Eletriptan .5 mg at 5:45 and went back to bed.  It gave little relief of symptoms. I was unable to sleep and at about 7 a.m. I was hit with waves of nausea and extreme violent vomiting. This last for several minutes. At approximately 9 a.m. I took a 2nd dose of Eletriptan and slept a little. Again at about 11: a.m. I was hit with another round of extreme nausea and vomiting which lasted about 5-6 minutes. I slept a bit and around 3 p.m. was finally able to drink a little water. Still very weak but pain had subsided significantly, down to about a 4 / 10.  By 6 pm. I was almost pain free ? symptom free though very weak still. Ate a little at about 7 p.m.  I know this was a migraine which I am diagnosed with but it was extreme even for me, and especially in recent years. It was very  unusual in timing and severity  and I felt it needed reporting.

                                                The minute I stood up after vaccine, I was very dizzy and my heart started pounding. Then I got nausea.  Was sent to Urgent Care office where I got EKG, which showed no problems with my heart. Went home, weak.  Woke at 2:00 am with night sweats. When I got up I noticed swelling on face, throat, hands &amp; feet. Faint pink rash ran up both fore arms and I had welts rising on my wrists. Nurse line I called said to to to ER asap, Took me a few hours to find a ride, my throat was closing up more by that point. I could tell over a few hours that my throat was swelling up. Went to nearest ER where I was very mentally confused. They  gave me a shot of steroids and Benedryl.  Later that night I got chills and was VERY weak. Had night sweats again. After a few days of rest, am still weak.

No other infections or symptoms thereof. ER visit with blood and urine tests and an MRI revealed nothing definitive. Response to symptom-alleviating shots was less than desirable, hence the MRI. Sent home with anti-vertigo and anti-nausea prescriptions and referral to an ENT specialist (appt set for Mar 21). Patient unable to do anything but lie down. Efficacy of prescriptions is pending. Symptoms are projected to gradually subside and eventually disappear.

                                                Seizures; throat swelled up; Troponin level increased; Mild heart attack; arm was hurting; breathing issues; Dry heaves; Mucus to come out; Nauseous; Dizzy; Headache; Ears became hypersensitive; Senses heightened; Throwed up; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient). A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6199 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration first dose on 07Mar2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included allergy history to a of number of medication and things (I&#39;m prone to allergies). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  On 07Mar2021, the patient received the first dose and she went to sit in the observation area for 5 minutes. The patient was not anxious at all about getting it but she started having a rapid heart rate/ bounding rapid heart beat and SOB/shortness of breath that lasted about a minute. The EMT checked her out and asked her to stay longer and she did and after about 5 more minutes the same thing happened again. These episodes lasted about 1 minute and she had dizziness with it. Also she did not have any further episodes and she stayed a long time. Her concern was whether this was indicative of an allergic reaction and should she still get the second dose. The patient was asking for information about 2nd dose being given after 42 days. The patient stated that she has not had any more of those symptoms at all. The patient arm was sore and swollen that was all now. The events heart rate increased, dyspnea, pain in extremity, and peripheral swelling was assessed by the reporter as serious (medically significant). The outcome of the events heart rate increased, dyspnea, and dizziness was recovered and unknown for the remaining events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

This time I am having more effects. Immediately I had blurred vision in my right eye and facial muscle tightening.  Upon arriving home I  became severely fatigued and and still am 24 hours later.  As of 16 hours later I developed severe pain in the right arm only, body aches, loss of taste and various facial tightening sensations and swelling tongue (I took Zyrtec for the latter and that helps). NO anaphylaxis.  THese may go away in the next day or so but that is as yet unknown.

My blood pressure increased to around 212/101 for much of the day.  Normal is around 120/70.  The dizziness finally subsided later in the day and the blood pressure went down to about 168/85 by evening.  Then I minor developed a headache.  I also developed sores in my mouth and on my tongue.  I still have those today (the day after).

                                                On-set on dizziness, severe pain and swelling in left arm. 6 hour later, severe pain shooting up my arm, radiating up my neck to my left ear. Severe pain on left side of chest, left breast and pain radiating over shoulder to back on left side. On scale of 1-10, the pain was a 9. Extreme heaviness on both sides of chest. I could breath but seemed difficult to take deep breaths. Took an extra dose of my blood pressure meds and it eased the pain to a 4-5 and I was finally able to sleep at 1:00 AM.  Starting on March 8, 2021 I began having severe night sweats and continue to have them at present (March 25, 2021). Dr does not recommend that I take the second vaccination due to my reaction to the first one. He did recommend that I take the Johnson &amp; Johnson but the health department is stating that I have to complete my vaccinations with the same on I started with. I will not have the second Pfizer.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: Jun2021), as single dose in left shoulder on 04Mar2021 at noon for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from May2012 and ongoing (autoimmune condition), ongoing undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) (autoimmune condition, unsure when diagnosed, started with polymyalgia rheumatica, then it went to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), then it went between Lupus and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), hospitalization: she had to go hospital twice in last 4 months, one was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril as another blood pressure medication, she had 2 mild anaphylactic reactions in the last 4 months from amlodipine and Lisinopril, patient thought they all have PEG in the ingredients; underwent colonoscopy unknown results. There were no concomitant medications.  On 04Mar2021 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, gasping for air, headache, dizzy, could not think clearly/her thinking was not clear, tongue swelling, swollen lips, throat closing/restriction in her throat, confused , sensation in her chest, weak, fatigued, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips.  Course of events was as follows: The patient drove two hours to get the vaccine. The patient was vaccinated on 04Mar2021 at noon. The reaction started immediately, the caller had a severe headache within seconds, a little bit of sensation in her chest. The patient&#39;s thoughts were getting mixed up, she was not thinking clearly. This was one of first things that happened. The patient stumbled a little bit and the nurses were there around her and said she better sit down now. Then the sensation in her throat was starting to feel like it was closing up, her lips were swollen; so she would say she was a little bit confused. The patient started getting dizzy and her thinking was not clear, her tongue swelled, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, she was gasping for air, she needed a moment to regulate her breathing. In regards to swollen lips she added at first she had a tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips, restriction in her throat, then she started slurring her words before the ambulance got there.  On site they responded and watched her because she did not know if the symptoms were going to get worse. The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol. Patient commented, she knew it was not recommended, but some people do it. The patient mentioned started speaking very badly and very fast, she started gulping for air, and was informed the histamines are hitting her.  She felt like she was going to faint, she thought if she was able to count back from ten she was going to be knocked out. Once she counted back she started to feel better. Like she would not faint. She did not faint often. She mentioned counting backwards from ten when getting a colonoscopy or something like don&#39;t get passed five and then knocked out, so she knows the sensation that can occur. After 1.5 hours they decided to call the emergency number and that was when the ambulance came. The ambulance service was the one who did everything for the patient. Because the patient got in the ambulance, they required her to go to the hospital, she was in a bed in the hall, by the time her doctor had looked at her, her throat had opened up and was feeling reasonably well after an hour an half. Confirmed she was not admitted just in the Emergency Room. On 04Mar202 the patient was at the hospital and was gasping for breath. The patient was on an IV and they gave her 125 mg of Solu-Medrol, 50 mg of Benadryl, and 5 mg of nausea medicine, phedrol the caller thought it was called. They did a good job and that helped the patient down from the most severe symptoms and she wanted to report her symptoms.  The patient has been looking around and she thought this reaction it was from the polyethylene glycol. She mentioned historically she had a minor reaction. She had to go hospital twice in last four months. One was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril which is another blood pressure medication. She confirmed she visited the emergency room for all 3 of these cases. The patient was still very confused on 09Mar2021 and over the weekend, she had to rest, she was weak and fatigued. On 09Mar2021 it was first real day she went back to work. She worked and asked her brother to watch out for her. On 10Mar2021 she was starting to feel a little bit better as regarded anaphylactic reaction, she has recovered with residual effects from the anaphylactic reaction.

Patient asked if there was a conclusion about the PEG and her anaphylactic reaction. Her second dose was scheduled on 25Mar2021. Patient stated that her PCP and the CDC recommend to not get the second dose. Caller wanted to know if the anaphylaxis could be worse in the second dose. The patient wanted to know if she should she get the next dose. She was very concerned about COVID as well but did not know if it&#39;s worth her risking her life. Patient wanted to know if she can get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine after a certain amount of time after receiving the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, caller cannot get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine due to a reaction. As of 12Mar2021 patent stated she does not wish to be contacted any further.   A Product Complaint was filed.

A 65-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left deltoid on 15Feb2021 at 15:30 as a single dose for protection against Covid.  Medical history included ongoing obesity as she gains and loses it, ongoing hypertension, ongoing asthma (at 59 she was bumped up to moderate degree asthma), ongoing significant food allergies, was born with and had ongoing eczema so she was allergic to milk (was given soy milk since she could not tolerate milk, when she drank milk, it produced phlegm/caused increase in mucus, ongoing significant environmental allergies wherein she would have allergies in the fall, from August through September and would have sneezing, congestion and itchy watery eyes. The patient also had a history of getting bronchitis but has not had it for a long time. The patient got stung by a bee when she was 40ish and her upper thigh got red, itchy and it lasted for 10 days and she and no other symptoms and was now careful around bees. The patient reacts to the smoky matches that blow out and make smoke, from the sulfa in the matches, fireplaces, wood burning and firepits. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma, start and stop date were not reported and fluticasone (manufacturer unknown) taken for asthma and allergies, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient was on significant medications for her asthma, allergies and blood pressure. The patient previously got a flu shot at the end of Oct2020. The patient also previously took Aleve in her early 40&#39;s and was taking them for a neck injury for 2-3 months and at the end of the treatment she broke out in a rash. The patient also previously took aspirin 3 years ago and broke out in a rash. The patient also has an albuterol inhaler but has not taken it for years. The patient was careful, handwashing normally, wipes the shopping carts as they are germy. The patient stated that after receiving the vaccine, one main event was terrible airway swelling, itching and it was difficult to breathe. The terrible airway swelling felt like breathing through a straw and narrowing airway. She stated that it started 18.5 hours after the vaccine, on 16Feb2021 at 10 am and lasted for 4 hours between 10 to 2 pm. The patient also had itching wherein her airway and trachea were itchy which also started on 16Feb2021 at 10 am to 2 pm. The patient experienced narrowing of airway and sensation of throat closure also between 10 am to 2 pm. The patient also experienced that it was difficult to breathe but she did not feel like she needed to go to the hospital. If it got any worse she would gave went to the emergency department.

It was difficult to breath like through a straw which also started from 10 am to 2pm. She did not feel like she wanted to walk or do daily activities. She was on the phone with her mother and her mother could hear her difficulty in talking and her heavy breathing. The patient also experienced pain in both lymph nodes, under both armpits and pain in both breasts which started also on 16Feb2021 at 10 am and lasted for 24 hours the 10 am the next day.

The patient was afraid to take the second vaccine and she spoke to her pulmonologist who knows her history and was told that she would benefit. She thought that if she felt bad, she would go to the emergency room if it got worse but it did not. The patient stated that she thinks these reactions are allergic, the itching and narrowing of throat can be anaphylactic. The patient did not require any medical intervention and was not seen in the emergency department and was not hospitalized. The events lasted for 4 hours and stayed at that level. The patient did not get any treatment and it went away. The outcome of the events terrible airway swelling, it felt like breathing through a straw, narrowing airway, Dry cough, Itching, airway/trachea itchy, Hoarseness, Sensation of throat closure/narrowing of airway, reactions are allergic and anaphylactic was recovered on 16Feb2021 at 14:00.

The patient reported that the events were considered as medically significant. The relatedness of the drug to the reactions from primary source reporter (method of assessment: Global Introspection) for the events was related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of vaccine BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be fully excluded since it is part of the product safety profile. Potential contributors include patient&#39;s advanced age, as well as underlying obesity, hypertension, asthma, eczema, multiple allergies and other co-morbidities.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included the patient having known allergies (unspecified). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was previously vaccinated with the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL0140) at the age of 65-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 14Jan2021 at 04:00 PM for Covid-19 immunization. On 01Mar2021, the patient experienced ischemic colitis, constant headaches, ears hurt, dizzy, generally not feeling well, and sore throat. The patient was hospitalized on an unspecified date due to the events for 5 days. It was unknown if the patient received treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject vaccine contributed to the event of ischemic colitis, which may  likely represent intercurrent medical condition.   Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the other reported events  due to temporal relationship   There is limited information provided in this report.

                                                Felt very much like I was going to faint.  Had nausea and without proper breathing and fighting through it, I would have passed out.  And I was driving.  The pain during the injection was one of the most severe I&#39;ve ever had.  It was injected in the top part of my shoulder where there is nothing but bone.

I felt faint numerous times up to 90 hours afterward.  Then complete resolution.  I also had 101 fever for 24 hours, chills, body aches, but these symptoms have been listed as common.

A 66-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249, expiry date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 11:37 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER9231, expiry date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced body aches, mostly in her arm and her knees are a little achy on 19Jan2021 22:00, chills on 19Jan2021, and kind of like the flu, like she was hit by a truck, had trouble getting off of the sofa, all on Jan2021. The patient just got her second Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She experienced nothing with the first dose. She had the second one yesterday 19Jan2021. Last night she had body aches and chills. The chills are completely gone and the body aches are 85%-90% better. She called out of work today, unknowing how long these would last, and her boss told her to get this reported. She does feel better. She was warned of the second dose being more ferocious. She felt great all day. Around 10 PM the body aches started. Kind of like the flu, like she was hit by a truck. She had trouble getting off of the sofa. They told her not to take Advil as it would make the vaccine not work as good. She is used to taking Advil. She confirmed she did not take the Advil. She took Tylenol instead, this morning. She had to go out and get some. The nurse told her when she got the second dose that she would have side effects and she would feel it. Her arm was sore so she circled it around. She went this morning to the pharmacy to get the Tylenol. She is unsure if because she was moving around, or because of the Tylenol that she feels so much better. Maybe like she could even go into work at Noon. She did not take Advil or Tylenol last night, which maybe that is why she was sore. The chills only lasted about half an hour last night and 15 minutes today. Body aches had greatly improved. It is mostly in her arm and her knees are a little achy. They are normally not. She is 85% better. It is going away as we speak. The outcome of the event Body aches, Pain in arm, knee pain was recovering, chills was recovered on 20Jan2021, while for the other events was unknown.

These symptoms came in waves and is a normal reaction I get with medication I am sensitive to. However because I not having a normal reaction, I was told to go to an emergency room for a EKG. I knew this wasn?t a heart event, but a reaction to the vaccine. It is a normal reaction for me. I?ve dealt with it most of my life.

                                                5-6 days after, my stomach felt pressure, like  something pushing in. On the night of the 6th day, I wasn&#39;t interested in eating, the pressure/discomfort feeling was increasing and I was uncomfortable all over and unable to get to sleep. Around 2 or 3 am, I had an episode of violent vomiting, which did not serve to make me feel any better. From that point on, for the next 24 hours, I continued to feel sick, extremely tired, and ached all over. I couldn&#39;t get comfortable, didn&#39;t feel like eating or even drinking, and had no energy, even to not being able to sit up and watch TV. As the 7th day continued, I threw up mid-day, was able to sip my way through 2 glasses (water, tea), and eat a few crackers. I felt very dizzy when I walked. I checked my temperature twice and didn&#39;t seem to be running a fever, which surprised me. I didn&#39;t take any pain relievers, as I felt I would just throw them up. By evening, however, I was able to take 2 ibuprofen, take a hot shower, and slept pretty well that night. By the 8th day, the aches were pretty much gone and I was able to eat soft foods and get rehydrated. I felt a little weak, still tired, and wobbly, but was clearly over the worst of it. By the 9th day, I was back to normal.

The heaviest shaking was of the right arm and hand which was where the vaccine was administered. Made my way to bedroom on my walker to tell hubby I was not feeling well,  Took blood pressure which was elevated and my heart felt like it was beating out my chest, Bllod pressure was elevated and so was pulse. Shaking continued and breathing was shallow, Waited 10 minutes and retook vitals, BP and pulse up more, Called 911, Paramedics came and monitored my vitals several times which after 20 minutes started declining, Could not say conclusively if was vaccine related. Elected due to Covid not to be transported to hospital and signed off on declination, Was told by paramedics to call 911 again if symptoms reoccurred and go to hospital,  In successive days I still continue to have pin-prick feelings and numbness in my right fingers, More difficult to walk than usual,

Some of the swelling went down during the night but came back the following day.  The swelling continued without any improvement and I started wearing compression socks on the 5th. day. (3-18)  I should have started sooner but I was hoping the swelling would go away on its home.  I have had some minor swelling in both feet at various times in the past 3 months due to some minor sprains and also because of limited movement due to my back injury.  The compression socks help keep the swelling down and I do not know how long I will need to use them.

After trying to drink a bit of water, fainted and vomited it all back up.  I was weak and tired.  Slept or rested all day and by late afternoon was able to hold down some toast and by evening symptoms had resolved.  Clearly, I am not sure that this was vaccine related since it occurred 2 wks after vaccination but felt should be reported.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after shot (during the night), I woke up with debilitating pain in multiple parts of my body: wrists; left groin and leg; neck/shoulders; lower back and had a headache.   All of these areas were thrubbing and interrupted sleep.  Also was very weak.   Was difficult to get out of bed or a chair and to walk. Also had loss of appetite.  At no time, did I have a temperature.(Note:  I play tennis so was very active early in the week). The course of the symptoms has lasted 96hours but now seems to be subsiding. After 48 hours of inability to do any normal life activities, I contacted my physician who prescribed a cordtisone shot and anti-inflamatory medication, which I&#39;ve taken for 2 days.

Thought to ?sit down before you fall down? then ?came to? next to toilet. Head resting on toilet seat. Had some bruising on cheek but don?t remember going to floor. Rest of day was okay with just the most common side effects. Never fainted before but not uncommon for me to be lightheaded with nausea. Most embarrassing...passed some stool.

A 66-years-old (non-pregnant) female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3302, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 11Mar2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy from 2006 and ongoing, since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer in 2006 and burning mouth syndrome. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient had other medications in two weeks which included unspecified dietary supplements. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took doxycycline from 2010 to an unknown date for Lyme&#39;s diseaseand experienced burning mouth syndrome. On 11Mar2021 at 02:00 PM, patient had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. These symptoms still continue. Patient stated that people were talking about the second dose being worse. Patient stated that some of the reactions in Mar2021 look like an allergic reaction. They (HCP) only have cautioned the patient about difficulty breathing in Mar2021. They were saying there wasn&#39;t anything they can do for it. Patient asked how long the side effects will last and how to go about changing the appointment. If they are going to continue, patient was very concerned about following up with the second shot and asked if they can have that second shot be postponed until patient was not experiencing these side effects to the effect that she was. She completed the self-reporting on Monday (15Mar2021), but because her side effects were not going away she wanted to reach out to someone. She has reached out to her practitioner and had an appointment yesterday. Doctors didn&#39;t really know because it was all very new. She had the first vaccination shot on 11Mar2021, almost a week ago. In the 15 minutes that she waited afterwards she definitely experienced palpitations and a feeling of lightheadedness. She has an underlying condition of burning and pain called neuropathy. She has had neuropathy since she had chemotherapy in 2006 for breast cancer. This exacerbated that. She had been very concerned about that prior. Everyone said and the CDC recommends even with neuropathy to go ahead with the vaccine. It also triggered another underlying condition. She had a reaction to a course of Doxycycline in 2010 for Lyme&#39;s disease that caused burning mouth syndrome. Both of these things were really acute now, the neuropathy and burning mouth syndrome. Monday (15Mar2021) was a particularly bad day because the symptoms of an allergy which were swelling of the face and throat, fast heart beat, and dizziness were with the burning mouth syndrome. She didn&#39;t have difficulty breathing. It was the nerve endings of the tongue that go all the way to the back of her throat and gave the sensation of the whole mouth being involved. Monday was difficult. It was 8 hours of an acute episode then it eased off a little that evening. She had no appetite on Monday and barely ate anything. Yesterday was ok and much better although she was being triggered by environmental thing such as food and toothpaste. Things she normally uses were setting it off. She had an acute reaction this morning to a protein shake she has had every day for 14 years. The reaction this morning, 17Mar2021, was a drop in blood pressure and palpitations. It passed. She has been documenting this and made her provider aware of what she was experiencing. She was participating in the V-Safe through the CDC that checks up on her everyday and asks about symptoms. She didn&#39;t know if she was supposed to report this to the vaccine adverse event system or not. Obviously, she didn&#39;t want to get COVID. She was struggling with the recommendation to get second shot because she was extremely concerned. She wanted to know how long will the side effects will last and if she can postpone getting the second shot until she gets reasonably well. No practitioner can recommend whether to do it or not to do it. She reported this information online to Pfizer on 15Mar2021. She provided the lot number when she reported it online. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. No treatments received from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The patient recovered with lasting effects from the events had palpitations, being lightheaded, sweating, exacerbation of existing neuropathy and especially burning mouth syndrome - nerve endings in tongue, lips and cheeks were all on fire. The outcome of the other reported events was unknown.

                                                The only immediate reaction to the vaccine was soreness in my arm. On March 11, I woke at 3:30 AM and had almost total hearing loss in my right ear along with some unsteadiness. I have also experienced unusual neurological symptoms like burning, tingling and numbness in my right foot, leg, hand and face. My second vaccine was delayed because I was taking steroids to help with hearing loss. I had my second shot on March 31 with no side effects to date.

A 66-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6208) via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm 10Mar2021 at 12:30 (66-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included thyroid, and &#34;had stem cells put in her hip&#34;. Concomitant medications included ongoing thyroid (ARMOUR THYROID) for thyroid. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm 17Feb2021 at 14:00 (65-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received the second dose of VARICELLA ZOSTER VACCINE RGE (CHO) (SHINGRIX) for shingles and felt like we were getting the flu and the next morning was fine. Patient states she had stem cells put in her hip and was (medical office name) for an x-ray to see how it&#39;s doing. She showed a nurse practitioner her hand and nurse practitioner said patient needs to report that. Patient states it swells right under her finger, swelling under her middle and ring finger. The joint went stiff and the pain. She can&#39;t bend her fingers, it is mostly her ring finger. She couldn&#39;t straighten it out or bend it all the way down, it was like it was locked. Following her second vaccine dose she has had pain in the center of the palms of her hands and bottom of her feet. The pain is inconsistent as it comes and goes. The feet pain come and go not bad like the hands. The middle of the palm pain comes and goes and the joint on 1 finger never did get better, it is worse at night and a teeny bit better in the morning. She felt pain in 1 of her feet for a moment yesterday and not continuous like her hand. The left hand is not swelling, the center of her palm has a weird feeling, states she has never had shingles before but imagines that is what the palm of her hand would feel like, it is an achy pain. States she kept telling her husband she has pain in the center of her hands and on the bottoms of her feet and feels like she is about to have a break out and didn&#39;t. Patient states it has been a month since she had the 2nd vaccine. States the symptoms all started within 24 hours of the 2nd vaccine. On 07Apr2021, nurse practitioner put a lubricant injection (name unknown) into her hand where the swelling was. Patient was told it was a lubricant that might help, and it has helped some. It is moving a little better today after the injection but she still has pain. Adverse events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event &#34;swells right under her finger&#34; and included lubricant injection. The outcome of swells right under her finger, joint stiffness, and joint lock was recovering; other events were not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Vertigo started after lying down the same night of getting the vaccine.  Vertigo continued every night and was accompanied by nystamus upon waking each morning.  Symptoms continued for the first several hours after awakening then would gradually get better and was much lighter during the day.  Would return every night and next morning and this continued for the next 7 days.   My head felt like it was in a fog and it seemed harder to think.  It was also very sinus like.  No nasal congestion, no post nasal drip, no cough, but my head felt thick and full.  I had headaches which I never get.  I took my blood pressure to be sure and it was normal.  I took Claritin (without the D), Flonase alone and then also Dymista, did the Neti pot, and took Ibuprofen.  Headache got better but still had the head fog.  Today is post vaccine day 8 and I finally woke up this morning feeling better.  Hope it lasts but I answered &#34;Unknown&#34; to Item 20 below because it&#39;s too soon to tell.

Over the next few days, I developed symptoms: slight fever of 99.4 F, diarrhea, unable to eat much, malaise, still dizzy and sort of &#34;blanking out&#34; at times. Arm pain lessened in 2 1/2 days.

                                                Almost immediately after taking the vaccine for covid19, I felt extreme dizziness (vertigo).  The nurse had me drink some water and eat some nuts. I had drunk some glucerna that morning for breakfast with my medication.  The RN had me wait for about an hour. I then called my primary care doctor who told me to go home and rest. He said that I did not need to go see him or go to a clinic or Emergency Room unless I felt worse. (I have progressively felt better).  I left his number and contact information  under the contact information above. However, I had received the shot from the Hospital site.  I am providing this as you were a little vague in your question about contact address. Anyway, my husband took my temperature about 6 pm. I had a temperature of about 93.8. I normally have a temperature of 98.6 F. He used a digital thermometer. However, I did not feel as if I had asthma. I did have a slight headache then and my arm was a little bit sore. Today (the 29th) my temperature is about normal. I do not have any breathing problems, but my arm is a little bit sore where I got the shot. I still have a slight headache, but it&#39;s not too bad. I don&#39;t need to take medication for it. There is no redness at the site of the injection. I should mention that one of the RN&#39;s did look at my fingernails and the color was normal which I assume means no problems with oxygen levels. I am only reporting this because of the extreme dizziness! I felt a lot better after about an hour after taking the shot, drinking the bottle of unflavored (still) water and eating the nuts. My A1C is back to normal today. (and remember I am not currently needing or taking any form of insulin but my doctor has my blood checked regularly and has for many years). I am only putting no on the item number 20 below because I still have a slight headache and a little bit of soreness in the injection site. Today the site of the injection  is not red either.

Dr., my internist, agrees that what happened was not a vasovagal syncope (hospital?s diagnosis).   My Experience: Within say 7 minutes of the injection I felt woozy, the wooziness intensified, I got intense pins and needles in my lower legs, fore arms and hands, and less so in my face. My speech became very slowed down, slurred  and I had a lot of difficulty forming words. It was as if I was extremely drunk. After they called the paramedics, I was not able to get myself out of my car or walk.  I lost motor coordination/control in hands and feet.  I was cold, never felt faint, and had slightly evaluated blood pressure for me( normal is 110/64 paramedics got it at 152/94).

I stared sweating and chilling, my body was shaking so bad I could not hold my thermometer. That lasted possibly 5 minutes, fever 100.8. Episodes of sweating alternating with cold chills occurred the remainder of the night. Exhaustion set in and I could not get out of bed.

                                                I was felling a bit dizzy upon awakening the day after the vaccination. Once in the bathroom I became very dizzy and started sweating profusely. I tried to walk back to the bedroom but fainted. I came to sitting on the floor. My husband brought me some water and stayed with me. It took quite a while for those symptoms to subside enough that I could get up and go back to bed.  For the next 7 or 8 hours I felt chilly and somewhat tired. Normal by late afternoon and evening.

I experienced some brief tingling of the skin on my chest as well and on the skin of my upper thighs.  I did not have trouble breathing, and did not develop a rash anywhere on my body.  The tingling remained localized to my face and the upper part of my mouth.   There was no swelling of my lips or redness of my lips.  Immediately after I received my injection I briefly felt the slightest bit of light headedness, but this resolved before I left the vaccination site.   I felt tired later in the evening and then began to experience headache and nausea, the typical side effects that I had anticipated and previously heard about.

But at 4:30 am  2/22/2021 I was awakened by intense  itching on my left arm and hand.  Over the next 2 hours the itching increased in intensity and progressed to my right arm and hand, over my upper back and shoulders, and along the back of my thighs and buttocks.        I took 2 Benadryl allergy tablets (25mg) and used Benadryl GEL extra strength on the affected areas.  This resulted in my sleepiness for the remainder of the day. Contacted my physicians office for an appointment to resolve the issue.

                                                I received the 2nd Covid injection.  I went to the 15-minute waiting area.  The waiting area was full, so my husband and I were standing.  I stand and work every day, so this was not difficult.  I texted my daughter, who is a hospital employee, and told her that we had a super experience with no wait and had already received our 2nd dose.  However, 5 to 7 minutes after the injection, I SUDDENLY felt dizzy and weak and had to sit down.  Within a minute or so, I could not stand or open my eyes.  The weakness made it difficult to breath or talk.  My husband had to lift me up into a wheelchair.  I was taken to the ER.  For the longest time, I could not even open my eyes or talk above a whisper. After 4 hours, I was able to get my eyes open and talk better.  I, gradually, was able to move my hands and feet.  Last of all, I could move my hips and walk.   It was as if my body had been put to sleep.  I could feel everything but my body wouldn?t move.  As it wore off, my face and limbs felt slightly tingly.  I was, basically, fine after 5 hours other than being tired from the experience. The doctors had no explanation for what happened and said it must be an emotional response to getting the shot.  They wrote that I was not exerting enough effort to move my body.  One said that I was hyperventilating when I pulled my mask up to breathe after he told me to hold my leg in the air.  Though I tried, I was too weak to hold my leg up and it fell to the bed. The doctor told me that I should not tell anyone about what had happened or people would not come to get the Covid vaccination.  He obviously knew that SOMETHING had happened that I couldn&#39;t control but he didn&#39;t put that in his report!

                                                About ten minutes after the shot, my heart suddenly started pounding, I was panting, and I got very hot.  Then tingling went all over my body, even in my lips.  At one point, I felt close to fainting.  The pharmacist lady gave me cold water (I asked for it), and I just sat there for quite a while.  Gradually my heart rate came down, and I got cold, but the tingling kept going, and I felt somewhat weak.  Since I didn&#39;t want any epinephrine (it affects my heart), and I didn&#39;t think I was so bad that I needed an ambulance, after being there nearly an hour my husband drove me home.  There I took some liquid Benadryl, and that seemed to help with the tingling.  I just took it easy after that.  Considering my reaction tothe first dose, I will NOT be getting the second one.  I don&#39;t need to consult with a doctor to decide that.  It was somewhat frightening because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was going to get.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

The fever persisted until mid afternoon that day, as did the body aches, and a headache. I spent the day dozing or sleeping.  I did eat some oatmeal and have a cup of black coffee about noon. That helped the headache.  That evening I was more tired than usual, but no fever or aches. The next day I was also very tired, but I did go to work. The rest of the week I  had no energy, but that was the only other side  effect.   After the first shot, I had only had an achy arm at the injection site that persisted for 2 or 3 days.

                                                feeling light headed; mild headache; fatigue; erratic bp/ spike in her blood pressure; feeling nauseous; accelerated HR; she had body shakes/body was trembling; to the point she thought she was going to pass out; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot no: EL1284) at vaccination age of 67-year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose to prevent COVID19 (covid-19 immunisation). Medical history included interstitial lung disease and overactive thyroid (She was treated for overactive thyroid, but it has been stable for five years). Concomitant medication included nitrofurantoin for interstitial lung disease and fluticasone. The patient previously took prednisone [prednisone acetate] (She did ten weeks of Prednisone and has been off Prednisone since the middle of Nov2020. She started at 30mg and tapered down to 20mg then to 10mg and then to 5mg until she was done). The patient experienced feeling lightheaded, mild headache, fatigue, erratic bp 01Feb2021 11:30, feeling nauseous on an unspecified date in 2021. Took Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine last week. Began feeling lightheaded, mild headache, fatigue, erratic BP on Monday, 4 days after receiving the vaccine. Went to Emergency department on Monday evening. Has been continuing off and on since Monday. Can these symptoms occur after 4 days patient questioned. Has already reported to DSU. She got Pfizer&#39;s COVID19 Vaccine a week ago today. She was doing fine and then Monday she started with mild headache, erratic blood pressure readings. She ended up in the ER because it was so high. It stabled out and she went home. She was feeling ok on Tuesday, but not quite normal. She was fine yesterday until last night then it started again with erratic blood pressure, fatigue, mild headache and lightheadedness. The headache is never pounding. The lightheadedness won&#39;t go away. Is that normal to have that many days after receiving the vaccine? It was four days before she started experiencing it. Now she feels kind of normal as long as she is laying down except for headache. As of 15Feb2021, the patient reported that she called a couple weeks ago and reported adverse side effects and she needed a couple questions answered. She mentioned that she was due to have the second vaccine this weeks (18Feb2021). She was extremely worried about doing it because even some of the effects she had after 4 days in the first vaccination have not subsided. She added that it landed her in emergency room a couple of times (also reported as ended up in the ER twice). She inquired if should she take the second one at this point or can she wait and if she can wait for how long. She mentioned that she had a spike in her blood pressure (BP), she had accelerated HR on an unspecified date in 2021, she was very lightheaded to the point she thought she was going to pass out on an unspecified date in 2021. The second time around, her body was trembling on an unspecified date in 2021, she had body shakes. It was not fun. All of these effects have returned to somewhat normalcy, but she is still experiencing lightheadedness. She has seen her own physicians, but she is not sure if she should proceed with the second vaccine. The outcome of the event lightheadedness was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was recovering.  Follow up (15Feb2021): New information received from a contactable consumer (patient) included: lab data, new event (accelerated HR, to the point she thought she was going to pass out, body shakes/trembling) and clinical course of the events.

                                                I woke up, and could not get out of bed  because I was sick. Aches and pain on entire body, tired, malaise, and  sick.  Then I got the chills, accompanied with a fever. My everyday temperature is 96.7 and I had a 99.7 fever.  My eyes were glassy and grey.   I was like this until the next day.  I had COVID19 on 11/18/2020 - I did not have the above symptoms of aches and pains or a fever or the chills.  My breathing and coughing finally was 99% better by February 2, 2021. My taste and smell is not back yet. Are there studies on how people react to vaccination if they had the COVID19? Is there research comparing prior COVID19 symptoms with adverseReactions symptoms?

From there I was going in and out of consciousness. My husband took my temp and it was just over 104 degrees. He wanted to call an ambulance to take me to the ER, but I refused not realizing how bad off I was. This went on for about 4 hours. My husband applied ice cold wash cloths to my forehead and back of my neck for hours. He finally was able to bring my temp down some. I used the cold cloths for just over two days. I was so fatigued I was unable to walk without help. Had a bad headache too. My husband gave me Tylenol off and on for days. My fever finally broke on the 5th day. I am still left with bad fatigue and some headache.  Have also had diarrhea. My husband kept fluids in me which also included Ensure. I had terrible fever blisters on my lower lip and the inside of my mouth was sore. I am due to have my 2nd shot in about a week, but because I still have some lingering symptoms, was advised to not have 2nd shot.

The patient has had cataracts since an unknown date prior to the vaccination. The patient was diagnosed with &#34;Rocky Mountain&#34; in 2009. She also mentioned that when she got the vaccine she did not tell them that she was on steroids and an antibiotic. She commented that she was not in good shape when she took the vaccine to begin with. She is immunosuppressed and thinks that she should not have received the vaccination. But she also stated that she took the vaccine because she is a severe asthmatic and does not have a strong immune system so if she got COVID, she would die. Concomitant medication included benazepril (BENAZEPRIL) for blood pressure abnormal from an unspecified start date and ongoing; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) for arrhythmia from 2014 and ongoing; rifaximin (XIFAXAN) for hepatic encephalopathy from 2014 and ongoing; lactulose (LACTULOSE)for hepatic failure, ammonia abnormal from 2014 and ongoing; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for autoimmune thyroiditis from 1984 and ongoing; omeprazole (PRILOSEC [OMEPRAZOLE]) for reflux gastritis, chronic gastritis from an unspecified start date and ongoing; alprazolam (XANAX) for anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder from 2009 and ongoing; albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]) for asthma from an unspecified start date and ongoing; ranitidine (RANITIDINE) for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.The patient previously took flu vaccine vii, olysio for hepatitis c and experienced histamine level increased, lyrica and experienced weight increased. Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered the patient experienced generalized aching on 01Mar2021 at 13:55 with outcome of not recovered. After twenty minutes she developed a pretty severe headache on 01Mar2021 14:05 with outcome of recovering. After 30 minutes she stared to feel nausea on 01Mar2021 at 14:15 with outcome of recovered. She stated that when she stood up to leave felt like started to feel dizzy on 01Mar2021  with outcome of unknown, and felt like she was going to faint on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown, her vision blurred on 01Mar2021  with outcome of not recovered and she had trouble getting into the elevator. She also experienced a loss of appetite on 01Mar2021 with outcome of recovering.

Lab tests and procedures included cardiac output: over 50 percent, echocardiogram: her heart was good and clear, electroencephalogram with unknown results, magnetic resonance imaging with unknown results, all on unknown dates.

A 67 -year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN6200, expiration date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 67 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diagnosed in 1978 with Gestational Diabetes, and that went away, but it came in 1995 and has been active and progressing ever since; Diabetes, Type Two; allergies to various medications; food allergy. Caller had concomitant medicines of unspecified anxiety medicine, pain medicine,anti-inflammatory, diabetic, blood pressure medicines, the statins. After getting the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, caller had adverse events that made her become hospitalized. She said she had developed dizziness, light headedness, headache, something in her throat, lost of voice, rash nausea, and vomiting. She was in the hospital for 5.5 hours. She originally has the appointment for the second dose of the vaccine on 25Mar2021 but it got cancelled. Caller got the vaccine on 04Mar2021, and the guy gave her the shot, and then said the would check on her in 10 minutes, because of the caller&#39;s history of allergies to various medications and foods. Caller reports that she started having a taste in her mouth, and then she got lightheaded, she was dizzy, she got a headache, she felt sick to her stomach and that progressively got worse to where she ended up throwing up twice at the hospital. Caller was given a Bendaryl, and some anti-nausea pills under her tongue, but she did not know she was rashy, until she got home, there was a rash on her chest, arms, back, and legs that was all bumpy and red. Caller started to feel a tickle in her throat, and she kept trying to clear her throat, and then her voice was gone. An ambulance was called, but her husband took her to the hospital because it was right across the street, because her doctor had advised her to get the shot at a site near the hospital because of her history of allergies. Caller reports that she was in the ER for like five and a half hours, and when she started to feel better, she said she wanted to go home and lay in her own bed if she is just going to be puking her guts out. Caller states that she went home and crashed and burned for a few days, with no voice, and she was still coughing to try and clear her throat, it felt like her throat was closing up. Caller confirms she was not admitted to the hospital for this reaction. All events started 04Mar2021. Treatment was given for all events. The outcome of the events was unknown. Caller had no other vaccines on the same day.

The biggest problem was that my eyes became strangely affected, like there were shutters being opened and closed in rhythmic waves inside my eyes. They were also very photosensitive and blurry. My whole head felt wrong. drove me home, (I could not have driven).  This lasted several hours. I had chills and stayed laying down with my eyes closed. By the end of the day I felt mostly recovered.  This series of events recurred 6 days later,  on Jan. 20th. This time it also lasted most of the day, but I continued feeling moderately unwell the next day, and today it continues. I feel weak and unsteady. My eyes are better but  not entirely. They ache and feel insecure. I am not currently feeling up to any activities besides resting.

                                                Patient is a 68yo female with a PMH s/f of osteoarthritis, CHF, TIA with right limb weakness and aphasia and HTN presenting with a 1 week history of bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, stiffness and weakness. Patient states that she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/14 last week at pharmacy. At the time of inoculation, she did not experience any symptoms and went home after the 15 minute waiting period. The next day, she developed a generalized headache that started in her neck and continued over her head. She states that this continued to get worse throughout the day and on Saturday, she woke up and described a constant, 10/10, dull-aching pain that started at her neck/back of head and extended down to her shoulders to the tips of her fingers. She also stated that she had the same pain starting around her groin extending down to her knees and ankles. Patient initially tried taking Tylenol and ibuprofen to treat the pain, and said that those treatments normally work for her osteoarthritis, but that her pain did not improve afterwards.  In addition to the pain, she also states that she developed worsening weakness to the point where she could not walk around her home. She stated that she thought moving around and being active had helped her fight through the pain and tolerate it, but that laying down and resting actually seemed to make it worse.  With her symptoms worsening and her inability to walk, she decided to come to the hospital to get further treatment. She denied ever having an adverse reaction to other vaccines she has received previously. She receives the flu vaccine every year, and received measles, polio and other childhood vaccinations that she could not recall. She was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica and started on 20mg prednisone daily. She had a remarkable response to the steroids and her symptoms resolved within 24 hours. She was discharged on her 3rd day of admission.   On ROS, she denies fevers, chills, night sweats, SOB, changes to vision, eye pain, cough, chest pain, sputum production, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria or hematuria. She affirmed weight loss, headache, neck stiffness, dizziness, lightheadedness, muscle stiffness/pain, reduced ROM, and urinary urgency and incontinence.

                                                About 12 hours after injection I developed a fever, body aches, chills, and severe arm soreness, hurt to lift my arm. Also had some slight nausea and headache. Took Ibuprofen helped some. Next day still felt off, arm still extremely sore, body aches, headache, fatigue. I continued with the Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol. Finally felt better by Sunday and was able to return to work on Monday.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 11Jan2021 5:15 PM at a single dose on arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing shellfish allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing iodine allergy from 1975 (she carries epi pen), ongoing Mitral valve prolapse (for 20 years), blood pressure high, and cholesterol. The patient had mitral valve prolapse for about 20 years now. They are just watching it now. She just saw the cardiologist, and had an echo done. If the symptoms worsen, they will proceed. Concomitant medications included diltiazem for blood pressure high and atorvastatin for cholesterol, both from an unspecified date and ongoing; she has been on these medications for 30 years now. On 11Jan2021, the patient experienced facial tingling, immediate pain in arm from injection, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all, left eye twitching, chills, nausea, no appetite, whole body ache, tired, whole body trembled, nervous. On 12Jan2021, the patient experienced back pain. The patient explained that on 11Jan2021, evening at 5:15pm, she received her first COVID 19 vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine was being given out at that time. She has shellfish and iodine allergies. So, they made her sit and wait 30 minutes after being injected. One of her daughters took her. On the drive home, a few minutes after leaving she developed facial tingling. At first, she thought nothing of it. She did have immediate pain in her arm from the injection. By the time she got home, she couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all. It was that painful. The next morning, she couldn&#39;t lift arm, and if she tried, she would be in pain. Also, her left eye started twitching right away also. That night she really noticed it. It was not a constant twitching. She thought at first it was because she was tired or from the pain in her body. But then she noticed the next day it was still doing that. It was still twitching. It is not constant, but it was here and there. She still had it on 13Jan2021, but so far nothing at the day of report (14Jan2021). She also had chills. She had on double clothes, and coverings on her feet and hands. The chills wouldn&#39;t go away. Her whole body trembled. On 13Jan2021, Wednesday morning, they went away. She experienced nausea and no appetite. Her whole body ached. It was so brutal. The problem was with her left eye. It didn&#39;t twitch constantly, but it got her nervous. She is pretty sure she is going to refuse the second dose. She has heard that the 2nd part is when most people have the worst side effects. So, she is not comfortable getting it. She also got back pain. It wasn&#39;t severe, but it was there. She is against getting the second shot. She stated that she is a medical assistant at a pediatric office. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got it (vaccine) because of her age. She was advised to get it as she was around patients. Work gave them the option. The inability to move her arm ended in the middle of night at 4 am 14Jan 2021. She noticed she could move her arm. Her second dose is scheduled for 01Feb2021 at 8:45 am. She does work in a pediatric office. If the second part of side effects are worse, then she doesn&#39;t want to take the chance. The eye has her concerned. Outcome of the events were as follows: facial tingling recovered on 11Jan2021, immediate pain in arm from injection recovered on 13Jan2021, chills recovered on 13Jan2021, nausea recovered on 13Jan2021, no appetite recovered on 13Jan2021, whole body ache recovered on 13Jan2021, couldn&#39;t lift her arm at all recovered on 14Jan2021, back pain was recovering, while outcome for events left eye twitching, tired, whole body trembled, and nervous, was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the shot, I began to have severe lower back pain (9 pm).   By Midnight, I had excruciating nerve pain shooting across my lower back along with the muscular back pain.   I was up all night in pain.   I did not take anything for the pain for fear of comprising the vaccine.   the next day pain was worse, called my doctor and was told I could take Tramadol, 50 mg.   It did nothing for the pain until I took another dose.   Pain got worse and I was unable to get myself out of bed, or from a sitting position without my husband pulling me up.   My muscles were not working, or it was just too painful, I&#39;m not sure.    Could barely walk.   This lasted for 3 full days and then the pain gradually started to subside.    Took a full week for back pain to totally go away.

I had the shot/vaccine (first dose) on Friday. I feel better today than yesterday. Friday I felt fine. I got symptoms yesterday. When I woke up yesterday. I was feeling a little woozy, I always stretch slowly in bed. I slowly raised myself on the bed but before I got up my torso fell backwards. I felt like I was fainting. The room was spinning. All day yesterday I did not drive. I walked very slowly. I was holding onto the wall. I felt lousy like I had the flu. I would lay down for 20 minutes, watching tv. My head was sideways and every time I would raise my head the room was spinning. Also there is not enough spit in my mouth. It is very dry. I had a slight headache. So I did not bother but no headache today. I supposed to get my 2nd dose on 02Feb2021. The action taken was not applicable. Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

This 68-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unknown route, on 14Jan2021 (at 08:30) at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included orthostatic intolerance, myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Relevant concomitant medications included hydrocortisone (CORTEF), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), fludrocortisone acetate (FLUDROCORTISON) and pyridostigmine. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. On 14Jan2021, after vaccination, she began to feel unsteady, weak, lightheaded, chest tight, and dizzy. Her eyed began swimming with a sensation of shutters being opened and closed in front of her. She could not see very well, eyes were very photosensitive. Layed down and slept, rested in a dark room most of the day. She had also chills and headache. But nightfall she felt mostly recovered, although not very energetic. About one week later, on 20Jan2021, it all happened again, all at once. She also rested for the day and slowly recovered. But this time it hasn&#39;t all gone away. She is still weak, fuzzy, unsteady, fatigued, she had headache, and &#39;my eyes are not right&#39; (as reported). Pre-vaccination and post-vaccination COVID tests were not performed. No treatments were given for the events. The outcome of the events &#39;unsteady&#39;, &#39;weak/not very energic/fatigued&#39;, &#39;Lightheaded/Dizzy&#39;, and &#39;chest tight&#39; was not recovered while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

The patient previously received influenza vaccine yearly, and received her pneumonia vaccines over the last several years, both for immunization and never had a reaction to a vaccine. The patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. No other vaccine received in four weeks. The patient developed a dull headache on 15Jan2021, one date after the vaccine, but that it resolved after 24 hours on 16Jan2021. On 16Jan2021 at 8:00 AM, the patient developed bilateral proximal muscle stiffness, weakness, and pain in her upper and lower extremities over the course of 1 week. The patient started experiencing this bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, stiffness and weakness beginning at the shoulders and hips and extending distally over several days. Her symptoms started out relatively mild and progressively got worse over the course of 7 days. She presented to the reporting healthcare professional 8 days after her vaccination and she was extremely weak and could not support herself to walk around in her home, the reporting healthcare professional suspect polymyalgia rheumatica. All the events (except dull headache) resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization. The patient was hospitalization due to all the above events for 3 days. The patient had a remarkable response to the treatment of prednisone during her hospitalization. It was unknown if covid prior vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included COVID tested (COVID test type: Nasal Swab, SARS-COVID19 PCR) post vaccination on 23Jan2021: Negative. Outcome of event headache was recovered on 16Jan2021 and all the events was recovered on an unspecified date.   Information about lot/batch number was requested; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded, considering the temporal relationship.  However, it is worth noting that the 68-year-old female patient had pre-existing osteoarthritis, which could be one of the causes of joint symptoms.

Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated, &#34;I got the vaccine yesterday about 3 pm and I came home and I had dinner and sat down to watch TV at 9 O&#39; clock, I turn the program on and I was out like a &#39;light&#39; and this stuff knock me out (onset date: 29Jan2021). My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Pt received her first Pfizer COVID vaccine today at approximately 1305.  She stated approximately 10 minutes into observation she developed abdominal pain and felt like she needed to have a BM.  She sat on the toilet and had an episode of diarrhea and started to feel flushed, diaphoretic and stood up to go to the sink.  She then felt nausea, dizziness and lightheaded and placed her head down leaning over the sink.  EMT arrived to bathroom and sat patient down in a wheelchair.  I arrived on scene shortly thereafter and the patient was pale and diaphoretic stating she did not feel well.  EMS was activated. She was placed on the cardiac monitor and her HR was NSR in the 80&#39;s.  BP 114/61, 96% on RA.   Denied CP, SOB, rash, mouth, lip or tongue swelling. She was brought back to the observation area and was assisted to the gurney.  Cool compresses were placed on her forehead and behind her neck.  Medics arrived to scene to assess the patient.  She stated she was feeling improved and did not want to go to the ED.  She signed the AMA form. She was given water and crackers. She was monitored for 1 hour and stated she felt improved.  She denied dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea or abdominal pain.  I assisted her to the bathroom and she had one more episode of diarrhea.  She stated she felt improved after that. She was monitored for 15 more minutes and stated she would like to go home.  She was able to get up off the gurney without assistance, stated she felt well.  She was ambulatory with a  Steady gait and assisted outside.  Prior to discharge I recommended she follow up with her PCP.  Advised that she rest for the remainder of the day and to activate 911 should she develop any new or worsening symptoms.  Advised that if she does get the second dose of vaccine she should be laying down at the time of administration and for 30 minutes after the injection for observation.

                                                First shot only chills and mild muscle aches gone by the next morning.  Second shot aftereffects were very different. Received the shot around noon on Tuesday , February 23, 2021. Later in the afternoon experienced muscle aches and chills. My head felt kind of weird. Hard to describe except I once had a morphine shot that made me feel close. I spent the next ~60 hours in bed. Fever, severe joint and muscle pain, migraine like headache, and brain fog is about all I remember. It could have been 2 hours or 60  hours, I don&#39;t remember. On Wednesday and Thursday my sedentary heart rate was 101 and 95 according to my Apple watch up from 77 on Tuesday. Couldn?t eat. Food tasted and smelled differently but not in a good way. Woke up this morning,Friday, with a mild headache and very fatigued but mostly back to normal.

                                                About two hours after receiving the Pfizer vaccine shot #1, my left arm became numb and stiff, starting at my wrist and worked up my upper arm. I could not lift my left arm at all, but when I tried, the pain was severe and radiated over the left half of my chest and over my heart.  I thought this might be a passing reaction, and went to bed early. My condition was the same in the morning, and I contacted my doctor, who directed me to go to the emergency room or to Urgent Care, which I did.

                                                Patient is a 68 y/o female who enrolled in program on 9/19/2018 who began monotherapy treatment with Pioglitazone 15mg PO on 10/5/2018. Patient called study team stating that she received her second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on 02/19/21.  Afterwards, she had a sore arm and slept most of the next day.  On 02/21/21, she experienced severe right-sided leg weakness and fell while attempting to go to the bathroom.  She was unable to ambulate and her son took her to the emergency room. She was hospitalized overnight for a serious adverse reaction to the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.  Multiple sclerosis exacerbation was ruled out after extensive testing. Then, she was transferred a Rehab facility on 02/22/21 for physical therapy and occupational therapy.  She continues study medication without any missed doses.  She will most likely be in Rehab for another week.  She was able to walk 80 feet on 2/25/2021 with a walker and gait belt and ambulatory assistance. This is unrelated to study drug. We consider this to be a Non-UP SAE.  As of 3/4/2021 the patient is still in rehab.

A 68-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration on right arm on 02Feb2021 at 14:00 (at the age of 68years) at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient just had the first dose of the covid vaccine shot on 02Feb2021 at 14:00 and her right arm that she received the shot in has gone to sleep. The patient asked if this was something to be concerned about. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

By 3/5 it was no longer inflamed, red or warm, but is still tender to lean on.  I informed my doctor&#39;s office of this.

However, since then, my arm has gotten very painful, especially from the shoulder to the elbow. I cannot raise the arm,have limited range of motion, sometimes tingling, needles and pins. For about 10 days, the underarm, the armpit, turned red, black and blue and bruised looking. This has begun  to subside. But the pain continues to increase.  I have seen my personal physician twice and have had a shoulder X-ray,a neurological exam of the arm, also a vascular ultrasound.  I am still waiting for an appointment with an orthopedic specialist.

By the end of the day, because of chest pain and dizziness my doctor sent me to the ER. I was then referred to a cardiologist, who indicated he thinks these symptoms are from the second dose of vaccine. He has seen several patients with the same symptoms after the second vaccine dose. My family doctor now thinks the same thing for the same reasons.

                                                Three days after dose 1 I experienced dizziness and violent vomiting (for 8 hours). Taken to emergency room. Admitted to hospital for hospital for 1 day.  Was given anti-vomiting/dizziness drugs, CT scan, IV for dehydration, pain and anxiety medicine. Diagnosis was vertigo. Upon release from hospital, consult with internist further diagnosed condition as labarynthitis. Headache and slight dizziness continued for a couple of weeks . After second dose dizziness, light-headedness and headache are significant enough to  take Tylenol regularly. These effects are still in place 12 days after 2nd dose. Will see internist if symptoms continue after 2 weeks.

Wave of extreme fatigue at approximately 10:30 AM 03/07/2021 fell asleep in chair until approximately 12:00 PM 03/07/2021. Upon awakening, could not lift my left foot until approximately 2-3 minutes later on 03/07/2021. My left foot was not asleep, I know the difference; it was like my left foot was paralyzed.  When I was able to get up out of the chair I looked in a mirror to check for signs of stroke-SMILE. No signs,  checked one eye at a time; equal vision in both.

                                                Headache, aches within 8 hours. Within 20 hours developed severe vertigo and nausea. Movement caused room spinning and broke out in cold sweat. Severe vertigo continued through second day (Feb 22), but seemed to diminish somewhat toward evening. Day 3 still had moderate vertigo/nausea but better than previous day. Went on a long walk. Day 4 moderate vertigo/nausea continued. Tried doing Epley exercises for vertigo. Vertigo/nausea became severe again, so severe I vomited several times. After vomiting got the shakes and felt very cold. Checked blood pressure and it was very high (170/98), but pulse rate was in low 30s. After a few hours blood pressure and pulse rate became closer to normal. Almost decided to go to ER clinic, but decided to wait until my daughter came home from work because I was way too dizzy to drive. After I calmed down I decided it wasn&#39;t an emergency. Severe vertigo continued through evening of day 4. On day 4 I called primary care doctor to see if there was anything I could do for the vertigo. She prescribed meclizine, but hearing that it is an antihistamine, I declined it (antihistamines make my heart race and make me very anxious). Severe vertigo/nausea continued through day 5 and day 6. (Severe vertigo/nausea being that I could not move around at all other than to sit still staring forward without the room spinning.) All this period I also had a headache, a feeling of pressure through my whole head/sinus area, and my vision was blurred. I also felt as though I could not focus my eyes or concentration. I tried using some over-the-counter nasal decongestant spray for 2 days to relieve congestion in head, but they made me feel very anxious, so I stopped. I also tried taking some Aleve a couple of times. It helped a little, but made me feel woozy, so stopped. Day 6 the vertigo/nausea improved to moderate, but I could still not walk straight. I felt unsafe to drive. Day 7 continued to improve, but still moderate vertigo/nausea. Day 8 I noticed a lot of improvement in vertigo/nausea. Kept improving day 9. By evening on day 10 I was noticing a rawness and lump in the back of my throat. Called primary care office day 11 to see someone. Drove car, but felt marginally safe driving. Was diagnosed with a sinus infection and prescribed a 10 day course of Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid (875-125 mg for 2 pills a day for 10 days). Felt improvement in throat and sinus over next few days. Day 15 I felt greatly improved with head ?fog? and vertigo. Had an appointment with an ENT clinic on day 15 to see what was causing vertigo. All tests were good for hearing, and visual examination of ears. Was checked for BPV but that was ruled out. Said vertigo was probably caused by viral infection or inflammation of vestibular nerve or canals. Recommended waiting for improvement and coming back if it persisted. Began doing more normal activities even though I still had mild vertigo. Day 16 felt still better in morning, then in afternoon bent over quickly to catch something and got a terrible wave of spinning again. Moderate/severe vertigo continued that evening. Improved to moderate on day 17 and 18. All along, when vertigo was worse, so was the ?fog? (blurry vision, inability to focus mentally). At day 19 I feel like I did on day 15, but I have noticed the pressure/lump around my ear and on left side of head is improved. Brain ?fog? is improved too, very mild and the vertigo is mild. I finish my antibiotic tomorrow.At present vertigo is not gone. Its mild today, but this is only one of maybe 2 1/2 days in which its been this mild (out of almost three weeks since I was vaccinated). I have been drinking a lot of water every day, and ginger tea when I get nauseous. I had my 2nd dose of the COVID Pfizer vaccine scheduled for Mar 15. I?ve cancelled it and intend to wait to see how long it takes for vertigo to finally resolve before considering a 2nd dose.

I also noticed what I would describe as discomfort in the lymph system.  Also, I have difficulty thinking clearly.  Tasks that I  usually complete easily such as online banking have been more difficult.  I&#39;m making mistakes.  As I write this I am now three days from the inoculation.  I have burning pain under my right arm.  I have burning pain in tops of my feet.  My hip joints are stiff.  My eyes are sore.  I feel generally fatigued.  This is not my normal level of functioning.

A 68-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6201; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 19Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The vaccine was administered in a Public Health Clinic/Veterans Administration facility. Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She had about 3 surgeries in lumbar area for fusions due to scoliosis in the past years (history of failed lumbar fusions due to scoliosis). Last one was about 5 years ago. Concomitant medications included roflumilast (DALIRESP), duloxetine, loratadine, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) and &#34;Spiri&#34;. The patient previously received pethidine hydrochloride (DEMEROL) and experienced allergies; and previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9264) in the right arm, on 28Jan2021 at 14:00, for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced a little lower back, bilateral hip and groin pain on 30Jan2021. The pain increased as time went on. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, after second injection, the pain (from first injection) became more intense and now has gone up to mid back and shoulders to the point where it hurts to walk, and she trips a lot. Nothing controls the pain including narcotics, heat, ice, Tylenol or ibuprofen. The pain was further described as constant burning, soreness, aching, stabbing and stiffening. The events were considered serious as the events resulted in disability or permanent damage. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association a contributory role of bnt162b2  to  the reported events  cannot  be totally  excluded.  The patient&#39;s history of scoliosis and failed lumbar fusions may also be contributory to the events.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is  received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She has a history of several allergies and she felt like she was going to have an allergic reaction. She became anxious and had slight shaking in her hands and legs.  She removed her mask and jacket and sat calmly. We took her BP and Pulse Ox and she was normal. She sat for 1 hour and then felt better to leave.  I followed-up with her 4 hrs later and she was okay but just didn&#39;t feel right. I advised her to come to the ER if her symptoms worsened.

Within approximately 48-72 hours I developed a severe bursitis on my left elbow, approximately 6 inches from the vaccination site - I had never had a bursitis before. The difficulty walking lessened after a few days, but I am still sore, possibly due to  bursae by joints.  I had a severe headache after approximately 48 hours which lasted for approximately 5 days.  My arm is still sore at the injection site more than 2 weeks after the vaccination.

A 68-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 08:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included multiple sclerosis from 1994 and ongoing Verbatim: MS. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included Tdap vaccine (DPT VACCINE) on 18Feb2016 for vaccination. The patient stated that she was looking for direction as well as reporting an exacerbation of MS following her first dose of the vaccine, clarified as the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, on 04Mar2021. Weight: Caller stated she would give her Covid weight. HCP: Caller reported that she is unsure of MD zip code.  She reported that the phone number for her MD ends in DOCS but she did not know which numbers that corresponded to. Caller reported that she did not experience any of the common side effects from the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  She did not experience a sore arm, fever, muscle aches, none of that.  She reported that she did not have any side effects until the afternoon of Saturday, 06Mar2021. Caller reported that she&#39;s had MS for many many years and that it has been in what she calls remission for a long time.  She stated that the last exacerbation she experienced was following a Tdap vaccination five years before.  Because of this experience, when the Covid vaccine came out, she went through her doctor to see what she should do, if she should get it.  Her doctor recommended that she get the Covid-19 vaccine, but told the caller that she should make sure to go to a health care facility to receive it instead of drugstore or a clinic due to her experience following the Tdap vaccine in 2016. Caller reports that she is now having a similar exacerbation following the Covid-19 vaccine. Exacerbation of MS: Caller stated that it is an ongoing exacerbation that is not getting better.  She stated that she&#39;s sure that it will get better, but she is not sure what she should do about the second dose. Legs weak, numb, tingly: Caller reported that the weakness, numbness, and tingling in her legs was progressive.  She stated that the weakness, numbness, and tingling began on Saturday afternoon, 06Mar2021, in her feet and lower legs, and had then progressed to her thighs by Sunday 07Mar2021 or Monday 08Mar2021. Arms are weak, numb, tingly: Caller reported  that she noticed on Sunday, 07Mar2021 that her hands were a little clumsy.  She reported that throughout the day of Sunday, 07Mar2021 and Monday, 08Mar2021, the numbness and tingling progressed into her upper arm. Facial tingling: Caller originally stated that she has been experiencing a lot of nerve sensation, then clarified as facial tingling, in particular around the mouth, below the nose, and on both sides of her face.  She stated that it began on Sunday, 07Mar2021 and was intermittently present on 08Mar2021 probably into 09Mar2021, then it just went away.  She stated that it would come and go. Caller reported that while she is able to walk and has not had to use her wheelchair, that it is a struggle to walk.  She also reported that it is a struggle to do things with her arms and hands.  She stated that if she wanted to eat, in order to pick up the fork she would probably be using 2 hands to get the fork up but can use it once it&#39;s in her hands.  She also reported that a pencil is difficult to pick up as well, stating that she would need to use both hands to pick it up but would be able to use the pencil once she had picked it up. Caller reported that the tingling comes and goes, and she experiences varying degrees of numbness.  She reported that they are a little numb throughout the day and it may get worse depending on what she&#39;s doing. She stated that she isn&#39;t a sitter, she has to get up and move. Caller reported that she called her physician, about the side effects she was experiencing and they instructed her to go to the Emergency Room.  She stated that their concern was what was going on and if it could be Guillain Barre disease, which she stated is extremely rare. Caller reported that when she went to the Emergency Room on 09Mar2021, they did not really do any tests.  She stated that in order to see if there were any new lesions for the MS, they would have to do an MRI of her brain. Caller reported that they did not believe that there were any new lesions, that they thought it was old lesions.  Caller reported that they told her to go home and make an appointment with the neurology resident clinic for that week, clarified as last week, week of 09Mar2021.  Caller reported that she called the neurology clinic as she does not currently have a neurologist, and they informed her that they would not be able to get her in for an appointment until the end of Apr2021.  She stated this was not doing her much good. Caller stated that they had wanted to admit her to the hospital, but told her that she could go home if she promised to follow up with the neurology resident clinic. Caller expressed some frustration, stating that she was really trying to reach out to see what she should do regarding the second dose.  Her physician tells her to go to the Emergency Room, the Emergency Room tells her to go to neurology.  She wants to know what will the second dose do.  She stated that she called the (state) chapter of the national MS society this morning, where they informed her that they had not heard any reports of exacerbations from the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller states that getting additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine is a lifelong decision.  She stated that Covid may not always be a pandemic, but it could come back like a yearly flu.  She stated that because additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine could be required, she wanted guidance on how to proceed. Her second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is scheduled for 25Mar2021. Clinical outcome of facial tingling was recovered on 09Mar2021, while for the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

A 68-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6205, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in her right arm on 05Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included allergy and had prosthetic left knee. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took tobramycin (NEBRACIN) for unspecified indication and experienced sensitivity. On an unspecified date, the patient reported that when she took the inoculation at that moment she developed a form of a response or reaction rather and they had to put her into the medical cubicle for observation and to treat her at that moment. Her arm had gotten very swollen. It became very hot and it became black and blue, it bleed and went black and blue and she was sitting in the medical cubicle for approximately an hour and a half until the medical staff said that she was really not to be and when she did leave she wasn&#39;t feeling well and she was light headed, her breathing was not anyway affected but she felt very fatigue. That itself now was not an issue. They started giving her ice on that particular area where the inoculation took place and she consistently for that an hour and a half used the ice on her right arm until she finally left an hour and a half later. As the weekend preceded, the patient began to feel that her throat bothering her as of today and her throat felt raspy.

A 68-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right deltoid on 06Mar2021 10:09 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis; famotidine (PEPCID) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis; methylprednisolone acetate (MEDROL) taken for anaphylaxis prophylaxis. The patient previously received H1N1 vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, lot number: UP006AA, expiry date: 15Mar2011) on 27Oct2009 and experienced anaphylaxis. Patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the suspect product. The patient experienced blood pressure was checked and it had skyrocketed to 204/110 (hospitalization (from 06Mar2021 to 08Mar2021)) on 06Mar2021, felt chest pressure on 06Mar2021 10:29, facial flushing and warmth on 06Mar2021 10:29, redness on her neck and chest on 06Mar2021 10:29, she was lightheaded on 08Mar2021, blood pressure had dropped to 95/58 on 08Mar2021 21:43. Clinical course: Caller states that she received her first dose of the product on 06Mar at 10:09am. Caller states that to provide some history, in Oct2009, she had anaphylaxis from the H1N1 Vaccine and in 2017, she finally found an allergist who specialized in medication allergies. Caller states that since then, any time she takes the Flu Vaccine, she pre medicates with a combination of antihistamines and a proton pump inhibitor. Caller states that in preparation of the COVID vaccine, her allergist prescribed her a Medro Dose pack and antihistamines and a proton pump inhibitor for preparation, starting three days prior to the vaccine, in order to prevent anaphylaxis. Caller states that 20 minutes post receiving the vaccine, she started to feel chest pressure, she had facial flushing and warmth, and redness on her neck and chest. Caller states that her blood pressure was checked and it had skyrocketed to 204/110. Caller states that she did not have anaphylaxis though. Caller reports that with her blood pressure being so high, they had to call paramedics, and the caller went via ambulance to the ER at about 1130am on 06Mar2021. Caller states that she spent 6 hours in the ER, and then she was put in the hospital for the next two days. Caller reports she was admitted to the hospital for her blood pressure because the ER could not get it below 185 systolic. Caller states that all her labs were negative for everything, and they checked heart attack markers that were all negative. Caller had an EKG and a stress test and those were both negative as well. Caller had blood work done, EKG and stress test that were all normal. But caller states that it took a while to get her blood pressure down. Caller states that she was talking with her allergist and he said that if she gets the second dose of the vaccine, it would need to be in a hospital setting, with an IV already in place, and caller does not think insurance will cover all that. Caller states that she did speak with an Infectious Disease doctor, who told the caller that she needs to get the second dose of the product for COVID coverage, but how would the caller move forward with getting the second dose, following what happened to her? Caller is wondering how much protection the vaccine provides after just one dose? Caller is also wondering, the hospital gave her at least two or three doses of Solu-Medrol, and caller is wondering if having received steroids in the hospital would reduce the efficacy of the COVID vaccine, and if so, by how much? Event Details: Caller had the vaccine, and the reaction started on 06Mar2021, and she was admitted on the same day. Caller was discharged from the hospital on 08Mar2021 around 330pm. Caller reports that the morning of her discharge from the hospital, her blood pressure had gotten back to 135 systolic, but before it was time for her to go down for the stress test, it was back to 159, and down while she was in nuclear medicine, it got to 160 systolic. Caller reports that the day she was discharged, she went home and got settled in, and she took her blood pressure and it was down to 128/78, but then that evening, things got spinning around her, and lights were flickering in her head, and she was lightheaded, and her blood pressure was 110/63 at 9pm and by 9:43pm, her blood pressure had dropped to 95/58. Caller states that it has not been a fun trip. Caller reports that the next morning, her blood pressure was back up to 139/78, but then later in the day she was lightheaded again, and by 9am her blood pressure was 111/69. Caller states that since then, her systolic blood pressure has been between 110 and 126. Caller states that there is nothing else she can think of. Caller states that she felt fine the morning of getting the COVID vaccine, she was looking forward to getting it, and she got herself on the list and made sure to consult with her allergist so that she would have prophylactic medications ready to go. Caller states that she does have a history of hypertension, but her blood pressure was 128/72 the morning of getting the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events Blood pressure high and Blood pressure dropped was recovering, of the other events was unknown. The reporter considered the event blood pressure had skyrocketed to 204/110 was related to the suspect vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and known drug safety profile, a possible contributory role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the reported event blood pressure increased cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old female contactable consumer reporting for herself received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6200, expiry date Jun2021) on 16Feb2021 at 14:45, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine for age and several comorbidities. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed 25 years ago, ongoing hypothyroidism diagnosed 25 years ago, liver resection in 2007 for a benign tumor (she had not been sick and it was found accidentally), liver bile duct stopped up from 2017 and ongoing (due to scar tissue from the liver resection surgery; she had an emergency stent placed in her bile duct), chronic Crohn&#39;s disease, ongoing thyroid disorder. The patient previously received flu vaccines on unspecified dates for immunization experiencing unspecified side effects some years ago, but this past year she didn&#39;t have a reaction. The patient previously received pneumonia shots on unspecified dates since few years. Family history included gallbladder problems in her sisters and mother. Concomitant medications included oral amlodipine (manufacturer: Lupin, expiry date: 23Feb2022) from an unspecified date (a few years ago) and ongoing, 5 mg at night, for blood pressure, oral telmisartan (MICARDIS; manufacturer: Alembic, expiry date: 02Mar2022) from an unspecified date (few years ago) and ongoing, 80 mg at night, for blood pressure, oral metoprolol (manufacturer: Mylan, expiry date: 09Feb2022), from an unspecified date (few years ago) and ongoing, 25 mg twice daily, morning and night, for blood pressure, oral levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date (20 years ago or more), 75 ug daily in morning, with water, hour before any eating or other medications, for thyroid disorder. The patient experienced sepsis on 25Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 03Mar2021, gallbladder attack on 24Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, passed out from the gallbladder attack on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of unknown, got dizzy on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, weakness from being hospitalized on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, she was trying to gain her strength from being sick on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of unknown, her head hurt from the fall on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. The patient was hospitalized for sepsis due to a gallbladder attack from 25Feb2021 to 03Mar2021. The events gallbladder attack and sepsis required also an ER visit. They did not require a physician office visit. Additional clinical course of the events included the following details. Gallbladder attack turned into infection/sepsis quickly. She previously had an emergency stent placed in her bile duct and now there was a stone in the bile duct and she was unsure if it was related; they will either remove her gallbladder or place a permanent stent. They removed stones and &#34;goop&#34; and placed a stent. Her gallbladder still needed to be operated on, but she was not sick with sepsis anymore. Regarding gallbladder attack the patient reported that it was controlled until further tests and surgery were performed. They couldn&#39;t do the surgery due to the infection which had cleared up but she did not want the surgery right now. A stent was placed in the duct until something was done and the stone will be crushed eventually. The patient passed out from the gallbladder attack. She never passed out, she had only ever passed out one other time in her 20&#39;s where she stood up too fast. The patient reported that she had to walk slower because she got dizzy and she was trying to adjust to getting home. She walked to the bathroom, used it, and her husband heard a thump while he was using the other bathroom. She was looking at the thermostat and fell in the den and she was surprised she didn&#39;t hit anything. Her head hurt from the fall. Sepsis: caller reported that as soon as she went to the ER, she was diagnosed with sepsis. Sepsis resolved the day she was discharged from hospital and when she was dismissed all tests were negative for sepsis. She went home on antibiotics for security for another week after discharge from hospital. Dizzy: it was just trying to get her strength up. She&#39;ll just be doing nothing and getting up too fast, it happened to any old person with blood pressure medicines. Dizziness began before she went into the hospital. She was experiencing weakness from being hospitalized and she was trying to gain her strength from being sick. Weakness began during her hospital admission and it was ongoing. On 03Mar2021 the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included haematocrit: 30.4 %, haemoglobin: 10.4 g/dl (not in normal range yet), CMP: within normal limits (all results were within normal limits, including sodium and potassium), platelet count: 159, RBC count: 3.33 (supposed to be 3.9 or more but could have gotten better by now), WBC: 6.1 x10?/L, blood cultures: the results were not yet listed but sepsis was gone according to discharge blood work. She went to the doctor regularly. Her doctor knew how sensitive that was with her, but that her side effects were probably no more than anyone that experienced that. In some years she did not experience adverse events, specifically she did not with her flu vaccine in 2020. She has had side effects that had made her feel ill for 2-3 days and her niece was a nurse and thought she was making it up. The patient was advised to wait for the 2nd dose, she was unable to get it as scheduled on 08Mar2021. In meantime between receiving her first dose and her appointment for her second dose on 08Mar2021, she was hospitalized. The patient was just coming out of the hospital before 08Mar2021 and she still did not feel well so she cancelled the appointment. The hospital doctors, as well as the doctors approaching more tests with her gallbladder, recommended to not get the second dose as scheduled on 08Mar2021, but they could not recommend how or when to get it.

                                                A few days after my shot I started feeling very tired and groggy.  My head was dizzy most of the day.  Five days after the vaccination I started to go into a sweat if I exerted myself too much.  I continued to have a dizzy head and my stamina was greatly reduced.  I used to ride my exercise bike for 90 -150 minutes a day but  after the vaccine I could only go 20 minutes the first week and then I got progressively weaker and more dizzy.  I could barely walk a half block.  I also experienced some shortness of breath and a racing heart at times.  The third week out was the worse.  I could hardly care for myself.  I started to get a lot of pain behind my eyes and other sinus pressure.  Also the lymph gland under my ear was swollen and painful.  I was extremely tired for a couple of days at that point but have found it hard to sleep on most other nights.  I have strange dreams that are almost like an hallucination.  I also have head aches but they seem to have improved as the weeks have gone by, especially since I have been taking Aleve every day.  I am unable to exercise and have very little energy still.  The dizzy head continues to persist even  6 weeks out.  I had this same kind of dizzy head in August when I had Covid but it went away in a week or two.  I get dizzy just reading a book or looking at my piano music also.  Having had Covid twice I am very confident that these symptoms were caused by this vaccination.  It also seemed to make my blood sugar more volatile.  The sad thing is that I was feeling perfectly normal when I went in!  I am devastated by these symptoms and they have completely altered my life.  I am so discouraged that they never go away.  Some days I feel like I am improving and then they pop up again.  I was a very active person and now I can hardly do anything.  I think I got the shot too close to when I had covid and that it has triggered an immune response that is overwhelming my body.  Will it ever get better?  I can&#39;t stand to go on like this!

The pain is a little less today, she is moving around now, and it has lessened to some degree, it is not as severe as yesterday or the day before. She didn&#39;t know if her liver was being affected or what, it is in that area. She feels her symptoms are 100% related to the vaccine.

All I had was the Pfizer COVID Vaccine.&#34; When paraphrased the concern, consumer stated, &#34;Yes, It is in my stomach area.&#34; The events coughing, sneezing and stomach pain were considered medically significant by the reporter. The outcome of the event slight dizziness was recovering, while of the rest was not recovered.

A 68-year-old female patient (consumer&#39;s mother) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number unknown as complainant does not have the product with them at the time of call) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Reporter was calling about her mother. The patient was fine before she got this shot and no one can seem to help her. They had the vaccine on 08Apr2021 and her mom (patient) started having severe reactions to it on 10Apr2021. Patient had the chills, muscle aches, muscle pain, headache, dizziness, her arm, and joint pain. She did not have fever, but had chills. She had double vision now. The symptoms are not going away. They are getting worse. They took her mom to the ER. The patient was confused. When talking to her she was talking out of her head. The severity of confusion is she thought her condo was turned completely around. Patient was not getting better. Went to the doctor and the doctor was at a lost. Patient was extremely exhausted. Caller stated they all took the same shot on the same day and her mom was the only one to have a reaction. Patient was literally out of her mind. Caller&#39;s dad had to take patient to the store with him because he didn&#39;t want to leave her by herself. They live in a condo on the second floor. Her mom thought the condo was reversed. Her dad was worried to leave her mom by herself because he didn&#39;t want her to go out the wrong door and go over the balcony. Her mom was not like that prior to receiving COVID19 Vaccine. Reporter was asked if there was an antidote. They were told patient should see her doctor and that she need treatment but no one could give they something to antidote the vaccine. The outcome of events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                I became weak and thought I was going to faint. I called the medical professional over and they brought me into a staged area for triage. My blood pressure was 171/ 104 or 114. I had chest pain. The EMT did and EKG, listened to my heart, and started an IV. The ambulance was called and I was transported by ambulance to the hospital. At the hospital another EKG was taken, blood pressure and blood work. Repeated blood work was taken. I was admitted to the hospital due to elevation of tyoponin level and chest pain. The following day 1/22/21 I saw my PCP and he thought it was related to the vaccine and recommended a cardiologist for the increased levels of tyoponin and chest pain.  The cardiologist performed another EKG&lt; more blood work and performed a cardiac catheterization and a ECO. Both were normal. Prior to that I was given a nitro pill as my chest pain was between a 7 and a 8; a few minutes later the nurse asked about my pain level and it was a 3-4. I was given another nitro pill and shortly after I felt extremely faint and my blood pressure was 56/32. I was immediately given a bolus of saline IV . The chest pain continued through the day. The following day, I had no further chest pain, my tyoponin levels returned to normal and I was released from the hospital.

I knew there was potential for side effects before taking the vaccine...I was totally unprepared for so many symptoms and how intense they were and what little I could do to relieve any of them. Never had fever that I am aware of. Today I?m weak and sweating is unreal.  ?? Should I prepare/expect my second dose around Feb. 14 to have the same effect on me.? Not looking forward to that. I was almost ready to go to the ER I was getting so dehydrated and weak.

She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL3248, expiry date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at 12:30 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient has a medical history of having covid infection in Aug2020 where her symptoms were low grade fever and headaches only. The patient also stated that when she gets a virus, she always gets this kind of rash. The patient is in an ongoing year -long antibody study where they check for antibodies every 3 months. The results of the 1st titre was 270 after her 10-day quarantine period, and in Dec2020, it was still 270. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she had a sore arm on Friday, the day of the vaccination, 15Jan2021. She experienced pain in her right arm which got stronger at the injection site overnight. Then on Saturday 16Jan2021 at 11:00 AM all her symptoms started. She developed a low grade fever that never went over 101.4, a little headache, dizziness, and body aches. She stated that it was weird because she rarely gets sick, but she felt like she had the flu. She is getting a low grade fever between 99.6 and 100, flu-like symptoms and was dizzy. Then on the night of Saturday 16Jan2021, when she went to bed she had a red rash on her chest and upper abdomen; it was diffuse not pinpoint, wasn&#39;t raised. The rash was across her chest, breasts, and above her belly button, but not on her back. The patient reported that she still has the rash, and that it has actually gotten worse; it&#39;s spread more across her whole chest which is typical. Since when she gets a virus, she always gets this kind of rash; it doesn&#39;t itch; it&#39;s just kind of there and it&#39;s always in the same place whenever she gets it. The outcome of the event &#39;red rash on her chest and upper abdomen; it was diffuse not pinpoint, wasn&#39;t raised/rash was across her chest, breasts, and above her belly button, but not on her back&#39; was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

She was started on the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole;trimethoprim (BACTRIM) on 22Jan2021 for a UTI which started after receiving first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Jan2021. She would like to know if it is okay to use this medication since she just received the vaccine. She reported that she submitted her urinalysis the same day that she received the vaccine on 20Jan2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included urinalysis: with unknown results on 20Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of UTI. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received my first COVID19 at around 5:00 p.m.  at Walgreens.  I was asked to remain in the store for 15 minutes.  By the time I got home, at around 5:25 p.m., I was feeling woozy, my neck was red (flushed), I had a strange metallic taste in my mouth, I was very thirsty, and I felt that my throat was somewhat constricted.  I immediately took a Benadryl.  (I knew to do this because I had done this when I had an allergic reaction to penicillin years ago.   By about an hour later I felt alright and the redness on my neck had almost faded away.

                                                Started within 2 hours of vaccine (8 pm) an extremely sore arm.  Then the pain started to radiate to my shoulder.  By the next day, it was really painful in my shoulder and across my back almost to my backbone.  It was painful to move my arm up or down or to reach for things. This lasted 3 to 4 days.  Then my neck on the same side as the shot (left) began to hurt so badly I couldn&#39;t move my neck up or down or sideways.  It was strange the way the pain slowly moved across by arm to my shoulder to my back and up my neck.  I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before.   Today my pain in my neck is bearable but I have soreness and a headache.  I hope I am at the end of the cycle to this event as I am scheduled for my next shot soon.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 20Jan2021 (15:00) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included penicillin allergy (Known allergies: penicillin, ciprofloxin, levofloxacin, hylan G-F, lexapro, bacitracin). Concomitant medication included potassium chloride.

The patient is not pregnant. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 22Jan2021 (10:00), the patient began to experience slight vertigo accompanied by metallic taste in mouth and phlegm drainage in throat (reported as &#34;phlym&#34;). When she laid down in bed at right side mainly her vertigo got worse. Late Saturday afternoon (23Jan2021), her right ear began to hurt. She went to urgent care at 7:30 pm. The doctor prescribed vertigo exercises, Flonase nasal spray for possible eustachian tube inflammation and ibuprophin. On Sunday (24Jan2021: today), the patient was still experiencing pretty severe vertigo; not much improved. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient had vertigo exercises, ibuprophin, and Flonase spray as treatment. The outcome of events was not recovered. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.

                                                Within a few seconds I felt very sleepy, my face became numb which began spreading to my mouth. Mentally spaced-out, weak and unable to drive my car even a few yards. Requested ambulance and was taken to emergency room. EMT administered Intravenous Benadryl. In hospital Pepcid was administered immediately. The numbness eventually spread throughout my body and I felt twitching/trembling, particularly my mouth and jaw. My feet felt like they were being pulled away from my body. After testing was complete, Solu-Medrol was administered and all symptoms disappeared immediately.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis, ongoing high cholesterol,  ongoing high blood pressure, celiac disease from 2005 (this has been tested too many times to count and it has been negative since after initial diagnosis 2005), arthritis (all her life) ongoing, hip replacement surgeries first done in 2005; repair of same hip in 2015; other hip in 2017. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Historical vaccines include Pneumonia Vaccine, Shingles Vaccine and Flu vaccines; all on an unspecified date for immunization. She never had adverse events with those. Ongoing concomitant medications included rosuvastatin (5 mg tablet) for high cholesterol, mesalamine (400 mg capsule) for ulcerative colitis and lisinopril from 2018 for high blood pressure. According to the patient, she knows that mesalamine is an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory to keep inflammation in the colon down. This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021 14:30 with immunosuppressant mesalamine. The night of 14Jan2021 patient had headache, chills, body aches, diarrhea, fatigue, fever and dizziness like Covid 19 symptoms. She went to the ER during the past 11 days for IV fluids due to deyhydration from the diarrhea. Today, 25Jan2021 is the first day she has been out of the house, except to go to the ER, since she received her 1st vaccine dose. On Jan2021 muscle pain, neck ache, backache, problems with balance and problems with walking. Events probably started with intense diarrhea starting 14Jan2021; then Fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit and chills 14Jan2021; Specific onset dates and onset times unknown otherwise other than between 14Jan2021 and 16Jan2021 onset dates. It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired. She will fall asleep through the day for 3-4 hours at a time and she does not even nap usually (Jan2021). She has not driven yet but assumes probably once she is a little stronger she will be able to drive again. She did not have upper respiratory, chest or cough issues. The outcome of the events fever, headache, body ache, muscle pain, neck ache was recovered on Jan2021; fatigue was not recovered. The outcome for the other events was unknown.

Five minutes later it was 123/83 and a third reading approximately 15 minutes after the original was 120/81.  The patient slowly felt better and was able to walk to find her companion.  She had a headache and decided to go home and forgo grocery shopping.  The next day she came in person to report experiencing tinnitus and mild headache still.  I sat with patient until she felt good enough to walk and then walked with her per her request to help her find her friend.  After about an hour of slowly getting better, but not good enough to follow through with her grocery shopping plans.  She decided to go home with her friend and rest and come back tomorrow to grocery shop and report back with any further symptoms.  She was feeling better enough to grocery shop and she was reminded to please fill out form for reporting purposes.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

                                                February 21, 2021 around 4 pm, a woman on the passenger  seat of a car, driven by her husband began feeling ? dizzy?. I was approached by our CIO to see her immediately. Another Nurse  came to the rescue and we both assessed the patient. She was awake, alert, oriented but anxious and stating she&#39;s dizzy. The back of the seat was lowered down for her comfort and blood pressure was taken. It was 172 /100 mmhg. PR = 72 , Temp = 97.5. RR = 18. Two other RNs came to help. The patient was conversant, her husband was upbeat and being funny. Pt started to play with her dog from the backseat reaching for it. The patient was talking but I decided to tell patient to relax since vital signs will be taken again. BP repeated after 6 minutes and its now 155/100, PR= 75, RR=19, TEMP= 97.3, 02 Sat @89 % . Pt?s hands were cold now. O2 Sat was also hard to get a good reading on all of her fingers. Called Dr. Cat Forest and she came to the scene comforting patient while vitsal signs were repeated again after 5 minutes  after they were taken Now getting BP=  55/110 mmhg, PR: 80, Temp 97.2 and O2 Sat still at 89% Pt was adviced to go the ER after the Patient?s O2 Sat stayed at 89% and also after finding out that patient haven?t had any physical for two years and that patient doesnt check her blood pressure. Pt and her husband were counselled on the importance of getting regular check up especially at her age of 69 years old. Husband drove patient to the ER per order. Called patient on Monday, 2/23 and Tuesday, 2/24 with no answer. emailed patient and patient answered back and she said that she went to the ER with her husband that day and was discharged and feeling better and wanting to thank the staff for the way she was taken cared of and hoping they will be there for her second dose when she comes back.

The tingling continued to spread over the next 10 minutes to both sides of tongue, towards the back. After about 15 minutes, I started to feel some stiffness of my jaw and teeth.  About 45 minutes later, I took 25mg benadryl at home.  The tingling and stiffness lasted a total of about 2 hours.

                                                Within 10 seconds I began to feel that something was wrong.   A full body response of a swirling congestion, extreme weakness. very blurry vision and couldn&#39;t think straight.  I had trouble walking to recovery room, felt nauseous and weak and had a very fast heartrate.  I had to stay in private recovery room for 45 min.  I was still very ill and nervous at this point.   I left with a family member and asked to be driven to the nearby hospital emergency room.  For a precaution .  We parked across from ER entrance for another 1 hour till I slowly regained strength to 50% normalcy.  I went home afterwards and had to go to bed. I was unable to drive my own vehicle home.  Day 2, still feel weak, shaky and not normal.  I consider this a serious adverse reaction that did not receive medical intervention but will prevent me from getting the second Pfizer shot.  After 5 hours post injection I felt 60% normal .  Day 2, 70 per cent normal.   The vaccination facility was not able to do blood pressure monitoring ( which is a problem for anyone experiencing reactions.)  They said their protocol was to call 911/ambulance.   My blood pressure was checked by a certified PA with professional equipment at the 3 hour post injection time and the diastolic pressure was still below 50.  And heart rate above normal.  Still weak and nauseous.

                                                About 30 hours after the vaccination I experienced dizziness and nausea.  Unable to walk easily.  No appetite.  Gradually the nauseous feeling went away (8-9 hours).  Dizziness decreased gradually.  Within 15 hours most of the dizziness was gone.  Checked blood pressure.  It was always in the normal range. Able to eat after about 14 hours of the onset of symptoms.

I tried Advil at first. No relief. I switched to Tylenol with the same results. No appetite. Tolerated some Saltine crackers with sips of Coca Cola, and sips of water. Stayed in bed all of 03/05/2021. I didn&#39;t stomach any meals, felt like throwing up, but didn&#39;t. Today 03/06/2021, left the bed, showered, still running a fever and not feeling like eating.

                                                One week after Vaccine #1 I began to have swelling &amp; itching of the face-eyes, lips and cheeks, extreme itching of both hands, massive diarrhea and some difficulty swallowing. I took oral benadryl (50 mg) and prednisone (@ 50 mg) and applied cold packs to my face and hands. I also took Allegra 180 mg LA 2x/daily for two weeks after the reaction. Vaccine dose 2 was administered on 2/17/2021 (Pfizer, Lot # EN6201) at Hospital, . One week after that (2/25/2021) I again had facial swelling and itching and massive diarrhea. I took Benadryl 25 mg and Allegra 2x/day and continue to do so.  The facial swelling/itching continued.             In addition I had, since the first vaccine, extreme fatigue, resulting in a decrease in my ability to walk (down from 3 miles to just over 1 mile) and to swim (shortness of breath, reduction in ability to swim laps). I visited my Rheumatologist on 3/2/2021 and he administered an injection of methylprednisolone to try and tamp down the continuing reaction. That seems to have made a difference.

This was followed by  nausea, itchiness under my lip, fatigue and pain at the injection site.   These were gone the next day except for nausea which lasted a few more hours.

Walked to bathroom to urinate. Stood up, started severe nausea and retching. The next thing I remember is finding myself on the ground in the bathroom, retching into the shower area. Called my husband (we are both physicians). My shirt was completely drenched. I was unable to stand up for 5-10 minutes. He noted a 6&#34; hole in the wall (completely through the sheetrock) behind me. I had no memory (and still don&#39;t) or falling or hitting my head. He walked me back to bed. My BP was 110/65, pulse was around 70, pulse ox was normal. Continued retching not as severe.  Took one Zofran. Eventually fell asleep. In the morning noticed a painful area at the left posterior part of my scalp. There were flakes of sheetrock there. The next day I was tired, felt slightly off balance, otherwise ok. Feeling of vague fuzziness, off-balance continued for a few days, then resolved.

                                                My second COVID-19 vaccination injection on Friday morning, 2/19/2021 resulted initially (starting on Saturday, the day following the vaccination} in a sore right wrist and a much more painful right arm that steadily grew in intensity and spread rather rapidly into my upper torso.  By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system&#39;s reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.  Still i can no longer stand and perform even the minimal movements to-and-from wheelchair to bed or toilet without substantial physical help (not needed before this exacerbation) from my sole caregiver, my husband.

During this time I noticed loss of movement and strength in both legs.  This continued to worsen. By about 2-23-21 (day I received 2nd dose) muscles in legs were very constricted making it difficult to walk.  Plus I have lost strength in both hands. Contacted my doctor who refereed me to a Neurologist  .  The Neurologist ran tests on 3-5-21 that indicate that I have nerve damage.  Doing physical therapy in an attempt to loosen muscle constriction and regain strength.

                                                Very sore arm starting about 4 ours post injection.  Couldn&#39;t raise it above shoulder level.  Felt very thick and heavy.  Throbbing.  Pulsating, as though I could feel my heartbeat in my arm when I went to bed.  Took to Tylenol or sleep would have been impossible.  Woke up to a less painful arm and it improved throughout day feeling almost normal by bedtime 24 hours later.  Took 2 Tylenol to ensure sleep.  Woke up Tuesday morning and arm felt almost 2100% normal.  I thought, wow, that wasn&#39;t so bad.  BUT I WAS WRONG.  Tuesday mid morning, I began to feel what I would describe as jittery.  Around 11:00 am a wave of nausea washed over me and subsided.  I thought maybe I needed to eat as I hadn&#39;t yet so I had lunch.  After lunch I began to feel nauseous again and like diarrhea was coming.  After going to the bathroom, the nausea started building again,  and the diarrhea recurred, and the nausea heightened.  By mid afternoon I was on the floor hugging the toilet bowl wanting to vomit, waiting to vomit, groaning.  It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve had nausea or vomiting and the whole experience was unexpected from what I read about possible reactions.  I wondered if it was food poisoning but my husband and I had eaten the same thing and he was fine.  Finally about 3:30-4:00, 48 ours post vaccine, I threw up multiple times, perhaps 5 times.    After about 4:30 pm it was over.  I was worried that if I ate again I&#39;d be sick so I only drank decaf tea.  I felt exhausted from the ordeal but very wired and jittery too.  I crawled into bed hoping for sleep.  No luck.  At 3:00 am I was still watching the clock and shocked that I couldn&#39;t sleep.  I had to get up at 6:30 in the morning due to some construction at our home.  I was legit exhausted Wednesday.  I no recurrence of the nausea or diarrhea after the bout on Tuesday afternoon.  I ate modestly but normally on Wednesday and slept normally Wednesday night.    Nothing more to report, although I read that up to a week later some people experienced a reaction so I wanted to give it a week to see if anything else would happen.  Nothing else to report.

I was fine. around 4 pm I had sudden burning and aching in my lower back and legs and I was shopping at the time so I went to use the restroom and could not hardly bend to sit on the toilet and I had a very hard time getting back up off the toilet. I went home and I alternated heat and ice on my back and I tried strengthening exercises and nothing helped. I tried Aleve and that gave me some relief. by the next monday night I was completely fine!

                                                Exactly 2 week after receiving the second Covid-19 vaccine shot I woke up in the morning with a serious balance issue.  I felt like I was on a rocking boat.  This was a constant feeling, with some days worse than others, but balance was off for two weeks.  I also experienced slight &#34;fogginess&#34;, which is still an issue.  I have never experienced any type of balance in my entire life.  This was most concerning.  After doing some intensive research, I found an article that some that recieved the vaccine did have some vestibular issues, balance/dizziness.  Which makes me think that my episode was vaccine related. I am only reporting this so that you can track a possible non-typical adverse reaction.  I am in no way indicating the vaccine was defective.

I have felt bouts of light-headedness, dizzyness, and tinges of nausea that are mild since I got the 1st shot, but not prior to that. Six hours after the first shot, i felt dizzy, nauseous =and it dissipated by an hour and disappeared entirely by late the next morning (1/22/2021). After the second shot, I had no side effects. However, as i described above, I have felt slight nausea and lightheadedness during the past month or so. But this is very serious. And I am scared to walk.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 26Feb2021 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) and vitamin. The patient previously took BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunisation (first dose on the left arm at 01:30 PM, lot number: EL 1283); and SHINGRIX vaccine in 2019, codeine and cipro and experienced allergies. On 27Feb2021 03:30 PM, the patient experienced chills, fatigue &amp; then sudden nausea &amp; lightheadedness that resulted in passing out. Unfortunately, the patient fell on a tile floor &amp; hit her head resulting in a 1.5 inch gash in the back of her head. When she went to the ER, it was determined that she now had vertigo (which she never had before) but obviously hard to tell if it was a side effect of the vaccine or from the fall. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the events which included CT scan, ekg, chest X-ray, bloodwk (unknown results) and Epley maneuver. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient is not pregnant. Outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Vaccine site still slightly sore and itches too. still not feeling myself, today is Wed. Mar 24.  May not have any bearing on vaccine but too much of a coincidence.

THE TINNITUS   SUBSIDED GRADUALLY OVER THE NEXT 2 WEEKS (APPROXIMATELY).  I AM NOT CURRENTLY, AS OF THIS DATE (MARCH 25) , EXPERIENCING THIS.  ASIDE FROM A MINOR SORENESS TO MY ARM LASTING LESS THAN 30 MINUTES, I COULD NOT &#39;FEEL&#39; THIS INJECTION AND  HAD NO OTHER ISSUES FOLLOWING THE VACCINE DOSE #1 UNTIL THE FOLLOWING: 2. DOSE #2: AT ABOUT 9:30 AM ON MONDAY, MARCH 22.  THE INJECTION (LEFT ARM, AGAIN) WAS, IN COMPARISON TO THE FIRST &#39;JAB&#39;, CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT THIS DID NOT CONCERN ME.  HOWEVER, ON MY DRIVE HOME (ABOUT 20 MINUTES) MY ARM GRADUALLY BECAME VERY SORE, AND CONTINUED TO BE PAINFUL AND GET WORSE OVER THE FOLLOWING HOURS.  I COULD NOT USE OR LIFT MY LEFT ARM WITH SIGNIFICANT PAIN NOT ALEVIATED BY IBUPROFEN (3 TO  4 AT A TIME).  THIS CONTINUED THROUGH WEDNESDAY, MARCH 24 AT WHICH TIME I TOOK ONE (1) TYLENOL AND ONE (1) IBUPROFEN, AND THAT HELPED WITH THE ACHE.  AS OF THURSDAY, MARCH 25 (WHEN I AM RECORDING THIS) IT  IS LESS PAINFUL, AND I AM ABLE TO LIFT THE LEFT ARM WITH LESS DISCOMFORT.   MY SHOULDER SOCKET ALSO SEEMS TO BE LESS PAINFUL.  I AM SENDING THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE I READ THAT TINNITUS HAS BEEN EXPERIENCE BY A SMALL GROUP OF VACCINE RECIPIENTS, AND BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED THAT PERSONS THE EXPERIENCE WAS MORE THE WAY THE VACCINE WAS INJECTED (MAYBE NOT IN THE CORRECT LOCATION).  I HAVE NOT FELT THE NEED TO SEE A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER HEALTH PROVIDER.  I HAVE CHANGED MY insurance AND AM REVIEWING NEW PROVIDERS.

Intense pain and swelling of right side of neck for 3 days. Also left wrist unable to use.  Pale, ill.  Vital signs ok.  Then on 3/8, pain switched to left side of neck and upper back. 3/10, right neck again with swollen lymph nodes bilateral.   3/11 back of neck and upper back hurts.  Intense.  Could not sleep. 3/12 pain in upper quads and hips, mid pack.  Feeling freezing cold.  Temp ok.  Called my Dr.  Right side of neck continued to hurts even now (3/28/2021) but at least I can function now.  I no longer feel sick, brain fog, cold.  So greatly improved but not normal.  Reaction has lasted a month.  Vaccine number one resulted in 2 days feeling ill with upper back pain, chills but only a few days.  First night vomited, passed out.  First vaccine reaction was frightening but was short lived.  I am a retired RN.

                                                excruciating low lumbar pain from L5 and S; Was unable to walk and sit; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse(patient). The 69-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in left arm on 13Mar2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6204) as single dose for precautionary for getting covid 19. Medical history included severe asthma, she had lumbar fusion T9-L5. Her lumbar back area was the worst area on her body even before she got the Covid vaccine. She had been in pain all the time 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There were no concomitant medications. On 14Mar2021 morning, she was unable to walk and sit, experiencing excruciating low lumbar pain from L5 and S. It continued all day, pain excruciated was screaming and crying until yesterday afternoon went to the hospital. She had not experienced pain ever like this. If she got up to use the bathroom, it was pain, excruciating pain the whole time she&#39;s up. The hospital didn&#39;t admit her because she did an MRI with contrast and without contrast and it showed no changes from her last MRI in Nov2020. She was still in severe pain. Doctor in the emergency room gave her 2 IV push of hydromorphone hydrochloride (DILAUDID) and did nothing. There was no pain as long as she&#39;s not moving but when she got up or move or go to the washroom to urinate has excruciating pain. She was supposed to get on the plane tomorrow not able to get out of bed. Pain was localized in one area like stabbing burning and excruciating pain if moving. It&#39;s not like a muscle or joint pain you get from a flu vaccine. She was prescribed Oxycodone 5/325 from the emergency room. She didn&#39;t take any oxycodone last night, she was hesitant to take pain meds. She was laying prone in bed except to get up to restroom, her husband gave her one of the oxycodone before he left for work this morning. It was unknown if the oxycodone was working, since she hadn&#39;t moved yet, she&#39;s laying prone and had not moved to the right or to the left and she just took it about 45 minutes ago. Lab data also included blood work, MRI with and without contrast, Covid test, with unknown results. Seriousness criteria for events was disability. Outcome of events was not recovered. She asked the emergency room doctor could this be related to the Covid vaccine and the doctor would not state whether he thought it was or was not. She&#39;s thinking it was related because it is so new and it&#39;s the only thing new that&#39;s been introduced into her body. Relatedness of drug to reactions by reporter was related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported excruciating low lumbar pain from L5, which resulted unable to walk and sit,  and the administration of the COVID19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.

A 69-year-old female patient (patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN3248, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Feb2021, 15:30 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 69 years). Medical history included blood pressure and thyroid. Concomitant medication patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included levothyroxine, valsartan, furosemide, acetaminophen. No other vaccine was received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 16Feb2021, 3 hours after the patient received the vaccination at 18:30 the patient&#39;s left leg from the knee down started to swell, got really hard and became very painful. She could hardly walk and afterwards the pain was so intense that she went to the doctor. Doctor took X-rays of her left leg on 16Feb2021, then he diagnosed her with blood clots. He gave the patient 2 heparin shots and immediately sent her to the hospital for a deep vein ultrasound on 16Feb2021. The results showed blood clot in the leg. The patient was prescribed medication and sent home. Her leg continued to be rock hard and painful. On 02Mar2021, the patient was sent for a blood panel work up. There was no improvement. On 08Mar2021, the doctor sent her for a lung CT scan. On the same evening, the patient was called to the doctor&#39;s office and was sent to ER immediately as the results showed blood clot in the lung. The patient&#39;s dose of Eliquis was doubled. This has now been going for 5 weeks, the patient had not been without pain during this time. Her left leg hardness had gone down a little but was still twice the size of her right leg, knee was huge. The swelling never goes down, not even at night. No covid prior vaccination and no covid tested post vaccination was reported. This case was reported as serious. The outcome of all the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: EM9810), on the morning of 16Feb2021 09:58 (at the age of 69-years-old) intramuscularly in the right arm as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included knee replacement surgery years ago, dyslipidemia, depression,  insomnia, constipation problems; she was taking clopidogrel (PLAVIX) because she had a hole in her heart last year (2020). This was fixed (on an unspecified date), and she was only taking PLAVIX once a day for one year, which will be until Jul2021; the patient called it a hole in her heart because that was what her heart specialist told her. Concomitant medications included: clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) taken for hole in heart from Aug2020 and ongoing, venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFEXOR), simvastatin (ZOCOR), and temazepam. The patient had an allergic reaction to sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim (BACTRIM), and she was also allergic to hydrocodone bitartrate/ paracetamol (VICODIN). On 17Feb2021, had a slight headache and a sore arm. On Friday, 19Feb2021, she woke up very nauseous to her stomach; no treatment received. The patient had hot and cold chills really bad. Her head was just drenched in sweat and this occurred all day long. When she did go to use the restroom and had a bowel movement, her stool was black. It was like black tar around 10:00 or 11pm, it was bad. Every time she sat down to use the bathroom, the sweating would get more intense and every time she would get up and use the restroom, she had to use a walker. Then, she used the walker to back up in the bed (19Feb2021), and she seemed to be okay. It seemed like the sweats would go away and she would get the cold chills. The patient just put a heating pad on her stomach, and this occurred all day long until Saturday morning. She mentions she does have constipation problems, but this was explosive. She couldn&#39;t get to the restroom a few times. She had several explosive bowel movements on 19Feb2021 10:00. Her husband brought the garbage pail in the bedroom and she did use plastic on the bedding. By 11:30-12pm on Saturday (20Feb2021), it completely stopped, but she was still sweating. She was so dizzy. It would hit her so bad and her head as wringing wet. However, when she would get back in the bed and lay down flat, the sweating would go away, and she would start to get the cold chills. The patient explained the sweating/hot and cold chills went away by yesterday afternoon (unspecified date). She was able to walk back and forth to the restroom with no problems. She verified all of her symptoms have improved. On 02Apr2021, the patient reported she received the second dose of the vaccine on 09Mar2021. The patient reported that sore arm and chills were important medical events, for which no treatment was received. Treatment received for diarrhea included &#34;limgen&#34;. The outcome of explosive bowel movements and stool black was recovered on 20Feb2021, and the other events recovered on an unspecified date.  Follow-up (02Apr2021): New information received from a contactable consumer includes: medical history, product data, concomitant medications, and event details. Case upgraded to serious.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 69-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated at a clinic. Medical history included Lyme disease, bell&#39;s palsy and neurological pain all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she had her first dose of the PFIZER BIONTECH COVID19 vaccine on 02Mar2021 (reported as a month ago). Also seeking assistance if we had any study as to patients who participated in the clinical trial with co-morbidity specifically to that of the Lyme disease. The patient also reported that she had &#34;bad reaction&#34; towards the vaccine that lead her HCP  to decide that she should no longer take the second dose of the vaccine. The patient said prior to this that she had Lyme disease, bell&#39;s palsy and some neurological pain. Also severe adverse events she experienced immediately after taking the first dose (02Mar2021) are dizziness for many hours, high blood pressure taken by paramedic to be at 175/110 when normal BP is at 120/70. Also experienced swelling of tongue after 15-20 mins post vaccination and felt pretty sick after days after. Also she mentioned that she can&#39;t have epinephrine for her severe adverse reactions to the vaccine. The patient was recommended not to take the second dose of the vaccine as she had severe adverse reaction during her first dose. The patient is asking assistance if she can be issued a certificate or a form that would state this for the purpose of international travels. The patient also inquires on any studies on the covid-19 vaccine and Lymes disease, as she had Lymes disease several years ago and had bells palsey, states she reacts to vaccines badly, the patient had her first dose of the covid-19 vaccine on 02Mar2021 had immediate dizziness for many hours, blood pressure was elevated, tongue swelled but did not close up, and cannot have epinephrine and was advised not to have the second dose of the vaccine. The patient also needs to travel overseas to visit with her mother and is asking if there is a waiver or something else she will need in order to travel. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was not available. No further information is expected.

A 70-year-old female patient receive first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration injection once to left upper arm in inner muscle on 10Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications. The patient experienced fatigue/ extremely tired in Jan2021, dizziness/ very dizzy on 14Jan2021 18:30, pain on her arms in Jan2021. Consumer said she received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine last Sunday and has been experiencing some side effects. These side effects include Dizziness, Extreme fatigue and Pain on her arms. She wants to know if this was normal. She got her shot, later clarified as COVID shot, at hospital last Sunday, so about a week ago, and had no side effects up until yesterday, she was extremely tired, and last night about 6:30PM, she was very dizzy until 5 this morning. She works at a hospital; they gave the shot. Outcome of extremely tired: stated she was in bed, was just very lethargic, being very dizzy went away at 5 this morning, states she has recovered completely but she is just a little off. When asked for vaccination card, states she shouldn&#39;t have gotten up that fast, this was really weird that it would wait 5 days. This was her first shot, thinks the dose was on the paper, it was 0.3mg, she was not sure. The outcome of events for dizziness/ very dizzy was resolved on 15Jan2021, for fatigue/ extremely tired was resolving, for other events was unknown.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL8982, unknown expiration), via injection in right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 prevention.  Medical history included ongoing vertigo (in car accident a little over 5 years ago, that affected a big nerve in left temple, and so every once in a while she will get vertigo so bad that she falls over), ongoing GERD (from a hiatal hernia; diagnosed many years ago), ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed about 15 years ago, ongoing bad cholesterol diagnosed 10 to 15 years ago, ongoing heart burn, ongoing hiatus hernia, and car accident a little over 5 years ago. Concomitant medications included ongoing omeprazole sodium (OMEPRAZOLE) for GERD, heart burn, and hiatal hernia (started this product at least 10 years ago; takes the product as needed if she is having heart burn or is going to eat spicy food); ongoing vitamin D3 for vitamin supplementation (started product about 8 months ago, because her doctor told her too, she guesses her vitamin was low); ongoing metoprolol for high blood pressure and to prevent stroke (started product at least 15 years ago; her BP could be regular but it could shoot up when she is upset, so she takes this to prevent stroke); ongoing hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure (started product at least 5 years ago); pravastatin for bad cholesterol  (started the product at least 4 or 5 or more years ago); and ongoing acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) to prevent stroke (has been taking this product forever, at least for 10 years).  The patient reported that she received the first COVID shot on 13Jan2021. She was okay on the 13th, 14th, and 15th. However, on the 16th (16Jan2021), she woke up and threw up once and was very dizzy for three days. She mentioned that she had like vertigo, she couldn&#39;t even walk, she had to crawl and her husband had to walk her around, she couldn&#39;t do anything. She had vertigo (16Jan2021). She was that way on Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, the patient&#39;s son took her to acupuncturist for her dizziness and was able to get up fine and walked away. After the acupuncture, she felt fine, like she was all better. On 19Jan2021 (reported as yesterday), she was fine. She woke up at midnight and had terrible acid reflux for 3 hours even though she had hardly eaten. She does take omeprazole for heart burn, and she had taken omeprazole earlier in the day, but it was just coming up, that acid and burning. She drank milk to coat the stomach and it went away at 03:00 AM. She had very bad chills/terrible chills (20Jan2021) and her teeth were chattering, she couldn&#39;t even talk, and couldn&#39;t control the chills. She is fine now. She clarified that she got vertigo from a car crash years ago and haven&#39;t had it in almost a year. Chills are not ongoing at this time, she has not had any for about 4 hours now, and she is hoping she is recovered completely, but it may be too soon to tell. She did not receive other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient is wondering if all this could be from the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if it is safe to take the second shot. She was scheduled to receive the second dose on 03Feb2021. The patient recovered from the events threw up on 16Jan2021; unable to walk and vertigo on 18Jan2021; dizziness on 19Jan2021; and terrible acid reflux on 20Jan2021. While unknown outcome for chills.

Took 1 gram APAP /Benadryl alternating with ASA 325mg  along with bedrest.   Over the course of 2 days the pain (myalgia and arthralgia), flu-like symptoms and congestion resolved.

Reminded me of the pain one would experience getting a cortisone shot. Three to four hours later pain in shoulder was substantial. Unable to lift arm, at all.  Pain continued throughout the night. Twenty-four hours later some improvement in arm mobility and marked pain.  Forty-five hours later not yet at full mobility and with slight to moderate pain.  Feel more attention to vaccine injection site is needed.

Lasted approx. 30-35 minutes. crawled with head hanging to floor to keep from passing out, to locate a phone for help. after several of agonizing attempts to try and climb up to couch to elevate legs high above head and laying there for  approx. 20 or more min. blood pressure came up some. (Did not call emergency services) afraid of hospitalization due to  all chronic health problems, (forgot to report earlier that I am Hypothyroid as well)  previously hospitalized for a Thyroid Storm.

Took acetaminophen  and some anti -nausea drugs I had on hand.  Fever left, but returned next night.  Weakness, no appetite stayed for two days.  Thought it was the flu, but no upper respiratory symptoms.  Thought it might be Covid-19 but tested negative.  Finally decided it was a reaction to the vaccine.

                                                Five hours after receiving the vaccine my husband I and were both extremely tired and fell asleep for about an hour - we were not able to complete simple tasks and went to bed early.  My husband was up every half hour urinating from 6pm  until about 3am.  We both felt fine this morning but about 11am I got super dizzy and had to sit down, the dizziness caused vomiting and a sever headache.  I laid down for about an hour and feel a bit better but the headache has remained!!   Hopefully this too will pass in a few more hours!  Just thought you might want to know.  If it gets worse I will contact my doctor.   My husband has not had any other adverse reactions.

The numbness in hand started at the same time as the tightness of her jaw. Her left hand is what went numb, and she had the vaccine administered in her left arm. The nervousness is getting better, but she felt very nervous. She also mentioned she has thyroid problems and is not sure if this has anything to do with it. She had this nervousness feeling 2 hours after getting the shot. Patient is scheduled to get the second vaccine on 18Feb2021. Benadryl has helped a lot.

                                                she experienced dizziness and weakness; she experienced dizziness and weakness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via the medical information team. A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot: EL9262, expiry: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 70years) on 27Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension and Crohn&#39;s. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, estradiol, levothyroxine and adalimumab (HUMIRA) for Crohn&#39;s. The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday. Next morning (on 28Jan2021) from Thursday until Saturday, she experienced dizziness and weakness as stated, &#34;when I woke I was severely dizzy and just weak and that is continued yesterday, well let&#39;s say Thursday, Friday and yesterday. I am feeling better today but I wanted to report that&#34;. The patient wanted to know if she should receive the second dose of the vaccine because these two symptoms were reported as signs of a severe allergic reaction and that&#39;s a contraindication to receive the second dose of the vaccine. The patient had some blood work done on an unspecified date. The patient took some diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) according to her physician. The patient further stated, &#34;I am just, I guess concerned, it does say on the paperwork that I received that you should not take the second dose if you had a severe allergic reaction which it list the dizziness and weakness one of those included so I am assuming that I should not take the second dose.&#34; The patient considered the events as non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovering.

I must keep my upper body and head upright, and avoid bending,  in order to prevent this dizziness.  As a result, I feel weak and uncomfortable, and fear doing normal movement and activity.

She has a weighted blanket and had that with 2 other blankets on her, and started shaking, and then her teeth started chattering and could not prevent them from banging together.  She was afraid she was going to break a tooth.  This lasted for almost an hour.  She finally fell asleep and normally does not move when sleeping, and tossed and turned all night.  She usually gets up a couple of times a night to use the bathroom, and did  not get up until 6:00 Am, and when she tried to get up she was woozy, and was not able to walk due to feeling like she was going to fall over and almost fell in the bathroom but has grab bars that she was able to grab.  She normally gets up at 4:00 Am, and got up at 8 after getting up at 6.  She was not able to sit up and when she got up for the day was listing like a drunken sailor and not able to eat and managed to get some water down.  She did take a Tylenol, and took her VS which were normal.  She had tried to call her doctor but due to weakness was not able to.  She was still uneasy from a deep sleep last night, but today she is feeling better but afraid of losing her balance.  Her arm is still a little sore, but pretty good right now.

                                                Fluctuating temp, 100.3-97.5 for 5 days, muscle weakness, body aches, unsteady on my feet, nausea, no appetite,  brain fog, extreme fatigue, for 8 days  or more. COPD so much worse that I had to use albuterol twice a day which I didn&#39;t use before lasting 2 weeks. No daily walk for 2 weeks because I couldn&#39;t balance properly. Sweats and chills not corresponding to temp fluctuation 2 weeks. Night sweats which I have never had before EVER. My scleritis kicked in really bad, worse than ever before. I still don&#39;t feel well  19 days later

Got home, collapsed in chair, had a faint sign of difficulty breathing, but not bad. Still felt swollen. Disappeared about 2 hours at home. Nausea getting worse. Feeling chilled, feverish, and dizzy.  Unable to sleep that night, so nauseated I couldn?t even swallow water without wanting to puke. Shot on Tuesday, didn?t feel much better till Friday. Ok now.

It was a few minutes before the patient reported to the observation nurse that she was having these symptoms.  By the time I was called over, the patient stated she was already feeling better.  Her vital signs were recorded and her case was discussed with the doctor on duty.  The patient was kept for an additional 10 minutes of observation.  Her symptoms completely resolved and she was discharged to home after the doctor saw her per the doctor&#39;s instructions.  The patient left the clinic ambulatory with out any further complaints.

                                                Before vaccination I was experiencing slight  sciatica pain in right lower back and buttock.  The morning (6:00 am)after the vaccination I got up and could hardly walk because of excruciating pain in right lower back and buttock.  I started taking a muscle relaxant and Ibuprofen for the pain.  Some days were better than others and after a week I started feeling better with no pain.  I also had right wrist pain (I had surgery on my right wrist Dec/ 31, 2020 for a cyst removal.)  I had trouble moving my right wrist.  I still have some wrist pain, especially in the morning.  It subsides somewhat after using it during the day.  My lips started peeling a couple of days after the vaccination. I used a lip balm several times daily It took a week for my lips to return to normal.  I am feeling well now and am glad to have received the vaccination.

                                                Immediately upon injection I felt totally dizzy as though I was drunk, slight pain at base of tongue left side. The dizziness somewhat passed within 40 minutes but not totally, same with slight pain at base of tongue left side. Went to bed as normal but awoke to having great difficulty breathing as soft tissue around entire neck was swollen as were lymph glands around neck area, that was pressing against my airway making it seem like I was suffocating slowly, being strangled by all the swelling. Hospital injected me with mega dose cocktail of large amount of steroids, Benadryl.  Symptoms subsided quite a bit at hospital only to keep continuing for nearly 2 weeks after. Because of this on Tues March 2, 2021 I had an appointment with my family doctor because the swelling was still quite intense. She put me on a 3-5 day dose of Prednisone.  I still have some swelling going on in my neck area from it today 3/20/21.  On item 21 I clicked Permanent damage as I&#39;m unsure if this swelling will be permanent and continue to come and go at this time or totally subside eventually. It&#39;s unknown at this time.

                                                This was 2nd dose. Starting before I sat down in the observation area: Pressure and pain at back of neck, dizziness, difficulty swallowing. This persisted until 3/17. I had a similar reaction to the first dose. 3/15: Rash on face and neck. 3/16 Rash spread to chest and upper arms. 3/17 face swollen; headache, scratchy throat.  3/18: Symptoms subside by end of day, although skin still a little blotchy. I did tell the person who gave me the injection about my reaction to the first dose and she looked for the rapid response team to watch me, but she didn&#39;t find them. I suggest a sign in the waiting area indicating which symptoms are of concern (hard to distinguish immune response from allergy and/or anxiety attack.

I mostly wanted to sleep. At first I did not associate the symptoms with the vaccine, but then realized it was probably associated. The fatigue and muscle aches lasted about 7 or 10 days.

Paramedic was called and took patient to the EMS tent - per EMS pt was diaphoretic with hypotension and near syncope -after laying down BP normalized and pt resumed normal status. Pt requested to go to the ED. Pt is currently being treated with chemotherapy and had her last dose 5 days prior.  She was brought in by EMS after appearing cool, diaphoretic, nauseous, and unwell after vaccine administration.  Patient states that she was feeling nauseous, dizzy, and weak 1 hour after administration.  She likely had a vasovagal-like response to vaccine administration.  Did not lose consciousness.

Medical history included breast cancer from 1988 to an unknown date , ovarian cancer from 2015 to an unknown date , she has had lymph nodes removed from her right arm &#34;30 years ago&#34; from 1988 to an unknown date, pass out from unknown date to unknown date. Concomitant medication included olaparib (LYNPARZA) taken for ovarian cancer from Feb2020 at 150mg, 2 tablets in the morning and 1-2 tablets at night by mouth.She says she is a little person and couldn&#39;t tolerate the side effects of that, so she varies how many she takes based on her side effects. She says she is supposed to take 300mg in the morning and 300mg at night. She says how she takes it is, she takes 150mg or one pill in the morning, then one or two at night depending on how she is doing. Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1, lot no: EL9264, route left arm for Covid-19 immunisation. Past drug history included on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out. The patient reported approximately 15 hours after the shot, on 21Feb2021 she had muscle spasms almost to seizure amount of shaking, full body muscle spasms. She clarifies that her side effects didn&#39;t kick in until 02:30AM on 21Feb2021. She says at 07:00AM on 21Feb2021 she got up and went into the bathroom and passed out, and had a low blood sugar episode she supposed.  She crashed unconscious to the floor. She said that could be from the shot, but she is also a high risk patient, a cancer patient, and is on a maintenance chemo drug. She says on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out, so she doesn&#39;t know if that was related to the COVID shot or not. No testing had been done on high risk patients, so she thought maybe this could be a good heads up for something someone else may experience. Her side effects were on and off for several hours, the shaking and spasms would subside and then start again. She says that they went away, and then she got up and passed out, and her foot was all messed up, she doesn&#39;t know what she did when she fell, but she had it checked and it was not broken, it was all bruised and swollen, but it was not broken. She says this was her right foot. She says she thinks she fell backwards, and she thinks she caught her foot under the vanity. On unknown date, she experienced bruising of foot, fatigue, foot was all messed up/it was all bruised and swollen, but it was not broken. She says this was her right foot. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Day of shot #2 (3/31/21) I experienced nausea in the first 15 minutes and felt confused while driving.  Nausea passed in 2-3 hours and I felt fine.  The next day I felt tired, foggy brain, and dizzy.  Assumed it was from the shot.  Side effects continued/worsened.  4/6/21 I saw my Dr.  She checked me over, labs. found nothing wrong with me.  Likely side effects from Pfizer.  Unlikely that they would last two weeks.  Rx Meclizine for dizziness, which didn&#39;t really help.  Now it&#39;s Day 15.  Tired and brain fog are gone.  I don&#39;t feel as dizzy.  BUT, when I try to drive, I feel QUITE dizzy with blurred vision.  This side effect persists and clearly effects my quality of life.

A nurse took my vitals and they were normal, although the BP was on the low side (I believe 95/54). They had me lie back in a recliner and kept checking me. After about 45 minutes my vision cleared and I sat up. About 10 minutes later I walked within the hospital to be sure I was safe to drive, and I was. The doctor on duty did also check me before I left.

A 71-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EI9262), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Jan2021 at 14:00 on the left arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and had no known allergies. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) on 03Jan2021 on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that on 25Jan2021, the next day after the vaccination, the patient woke up with severe muscle and joint pain, fever 100°F, dizziness, severe headache and no appetite. The patient took 2 Tylenol and it got better. Six hours later she took another 2 Tylenol because the headache came back; slept a couple of times a day and had a good night&#39;s sleep. Next day, she was a little better but still in bed, she fed myself better. The next day she went to the doctor (prior appointment) and was prescribed Meloxicam and Tylenol 6 hours after and was getting better. The outcome of the events was recovered. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID.

                                                This patient started to feel lightheaded and had a dry mouth approximately 5 minutes after receiving her Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Over the next 20 to 25 minutes she progressed to having a sensation of tongue swelling, then difficulty swallowing, then chest tightness.  Her vital signs were stable throughout the observation period (blood pressure 144/74 and 150/70, pulse in the high 80s to low 90s, and oxygen saturation 96-98% on room air) and she was able to speak in full sentences without any respiratory distress.  Her lungs were clear and she had no stridor.  She never had any pruritic symptoms or rash/hives.  Because of the progressive nature of her symptoms, however, I felt she needed emergency room evaluation for observation.  We never administered any medication while at the vaccine clinic including epinephrine or Benadryl.  After approximately 25 minutes, 911 was called and she was transported by ambulance to the emergency room in stable condition.

The injection site was very high in the left shoulder, near the boney prominence.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

                                                This was the second shot in series of 2. First shot only gave me a sore arm at site &amp; was administered on February 6, 2021.  Second shot was administered on March 3, 2021. Started feeling these adverse effects about 9 or 10 am the following morning, 3/4/2021. Symptoms were soreness at site, in muscle that goes to the neck, headache, soreness across upper back/shoulder to shoulder. By 4 pm on 3/4, my entire body was reacting with extreme joint pain in all joints, extreme joint stiffness, skin was tender to the touch, temperature of 100.1, sore/stiff neck, and continuing headache. Temperature ceased around 11:30 pm but all other symptoms remained upon going to bed at 1 a.m., 3/5/2021. Upon waking at about 7:30 am 3/5/2021, all symptoms had diminished enough for me to go to an appointment at 10:45 am. However, by the time I headed back home at about 1:30 pm, I was so sleepy I could hardly keep my eyes open. More stiffness and achiness had returned too, especially a sore left underarm. Not the extent of night before, but enough to be uncomfortable. Today, 3/6/2021, I have noticed a sore muscle traveling from my left underarm down to my waist.

Told my husband it was too high(I am a retired CMA). The following Monday my arm started to hurt. By Wednesday I could not move my arm. I felt as I if I had bursitis in the shoulder. It has been more than 3 weeks and I am still having pain.

                                                With my first vaccine shot on 2/1/21 I developed a small itchy spot on my neck immediately following injection.  The doctor on site recommended waiting there at the hospital to monitor it for a few minutes, and I did, and the spot went away.  My second vaccination was 2/24/21 and the next day, around noon, I started to have a back ache.  Late afternoon I became a little light headed and slightly queasy.  That night the pain started in my joints - neck, shoulders, all down my back.  They became rather intense, and at one point during the night, after I had managed to fall asleep, I was awoken with burning pain in both elbows, and random sharp pains in toes and fingers.  I took Tylenol through the afternoon and night.   The following day I was still sore, but not in pain.  Then all symptoms disappeared. Not severe enough to seek medical attention but thought I ought to report symptoms for medical research reasons.

Both legs started getting a strange warm sensation, the size of a pea that kept getting warmer.  She was not able to get up or open her eyes, doesn&#39;t know if she passed out but apparently went to sleep and slept for 3 hours and woke up and went to bed.  She then had toe cramps on her left foot, then got up and walked around the bed and laid down again and fell asleep until the morning.  She did not feel normal until 3/5/21.  On Sunday, 3/7/21 had nausea, took something for that and the next day she was fine.

                                                Dizziness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 71-year-old female patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, lot number: EL9263, exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: arm left) on 02Feb2021 11:00 as treatment first dose (COVID-19 immunisation). Vaccination Facility Type: at the mall. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. Medical history included diabetes type 1, from late 30s or 40s; and she had a stroke when she was 53 years old. Family history included sister with type 1 diabetes, other sister with hypogammaglobulin anemia. Concomitant medication included ongoing oral ramipril taking since she was 53 because she had a stroke as blood thinner. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She thought she got Moderna but they sent her home with Pfizer paper. Asking how can she know which vaccine she had? Then states now she sees the name Pfizer on her vaccine card. Mentions that she had some dizziness in the last half hour on 02Feb2021. She was scheduled to receive the next dose of the vaccine 23Feb2021. No investigation assessment performed. The outcome of dizziness was recovering (ongoing at the time of reporting).

Then abdominal pain, nausea, then feeling of something really wrong, I didn?t feel well, then got weaker and weaker, couldn?t lift arms, and felt extremely fatigued, trouble staying awake.  Taken by ambulance to medical center.  On route,  ambulance stopped and another team came in. I was given epinephrine, zofran, Benadryl, and maybe a steroid? Not sure.  When I arrived at hospital, t think I was given dexamethasone and famotidine.  I was barely awake but could speak. Could not hold anything. After several hours, they woke me up, I felt myself again, and I was discharged.  Following days I felt exhausted and dizzy, and had a headache. Took prednisone for five days.

A 71-year-old patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: Unknown) via an unknown route of administration on 12Mar2021 at 11:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in airfield where they build airplanes. Medical history included spleen removed many years ago due to enlargement from the blood disorder. Also had ongoing spherocytosis (States takes B12 and Folic Acid for this condition), ongoing sleep disorder, ongoing narcolepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome. She got pneumonia and respiratory failure after pneumonia vaccine and was hospitalized for 6 weeks. This happened years ago. She was almost died. So she avoids vaccines. Concomitant medications included ongoing methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN) for sleep disorder and narcolepsy (20 years), folic acid for spherocytosis, cyanocobalamin (B12-VITAMIIN) for spherocytosis. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine on 12Mar2021 at 11:30 (Friday as reported). In the evening she started experiencing some reactions (caller states she got the paper with the side effects and it mentions that they are usually worse after the second dose of the vaccine); chills, hives, headache and extreme fatigue on 12Mar2021. She is still very tired (crippling fatigue) and her headache is not so bad. She felt fine until around 1700 of the same day, when she experienced chills, hives, headache, became very tired, couldn&#39;t stay awake and went to bed. The next day she still had a headache, was still tired, hives were gone. At this time, just the extreme fatigue is continuing. States that today she is so tired she cannot function. Also mentions that she did not get a vaccine card from the facility that administered the vaccination. States that she is sorry that she got the product because she has a history of chronic fatigue syndrome and wondered if this would trigger it; but that her doctor said it would not. Caller feels that it has, because she can&#39;t function and this is terrible. She was afraid to get the second dose if she felt this crappy after the first one. She had no soreness or anything from the injection. With this amount of fatigue, she is just exhausted. States she has not been seen by her doctor, did not expect her doctor to do anything. A visit to emergency room or physician office was not required for events. Events were reported as medically significant. Specific causality was not provided for each event by the reporter. The outcome of event hives recovered on 13Mar2021; for events headache and fatigue was not recovered; for other events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal assosciation, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events,chills, hives, headache, extreme fatigue ,somnolence and cannot function cannot be completely ruled out.

Around 7 am I began having uncontrollable diarrhea with weakness and dizziness following.  No fever, just flu-like symptoms.  With rest and liquids by mid-day I was starting to feel a little better.

Patient received first dose on 17Jan2021 and second on 05Feb2021. It was reported that the patient has been having joint pain starting from 19Feb2021 and it fluctuates from one joint to another so if the patient&#39;s shoulder is affected, the joint pain goes to the other side and then to a different joint such as her knee joint. The pain was continuous, and it doesn&#39;t disappear. Reporter mentioned that it gets better with medication but it&#39;s still not going away. Regarding patient&#39;s treatment, it was reported that in the beginning, patient was taking ibuprofen but now the doctor switched it to naproxen (ALEVE) and also added hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen (NORCO). Reporter mentioned that sometimes not only the patient&#39;s joints gets affected, patient also experienced difficulty chewing, but it goes away and then comes back.

Initially, reporter mentioned that patient doesn&#39;t have eye floaters before but now she does, then clarified she has seen it before the vaccine, but now she sees it more and it is pretty much every day.

Seriousness criteria for joint was reported that this is disabling as the patient was having difficulty walking, getting up from the bed from the chair, patient has to use a walker to walk and needs help going to bathroom and taking a shower. It was reported that joint pain has definitely affected patient&#39;s normal walking.

Reporter mentioned that difficulty chewing started over the last few days, on Friday or Saturday. It comes and goes, one day patient might have it in the afternoon, but it goes away in the evening. Reporter added that the eye floaters started more in the last one week. They do not know why this is happening, if it was vaccine related or not. The medicines the patient takes shouldn&#39;t be causing these, but they don&#39;t know if it was the medicine causing it or if it&#39;s the vaccine. Causality for was reported as &#39;didn&#39;t have these issues before, thinks it&#39;s related, this is for all the events&#39;. It was further reported that the doctor did the CRP and it was elevated also reported as C reactive protein- elevated on Monday 08Mar2021.

                                                Six days after receiving the vaccine I woke up on Friday, March 12, with a complete feeling of exhaustion.  Weakness was extreme in my whole left side and could barely put weight on the left side. I thought this would pass so tried to get along. The next day, Saturday, March 13, the complete exhaustion was even worse.  Trying to get out of bed was very hard. I called a friend and went to  hospital here .   I was admitted, tested, and kept for several days. The report came back that I had a series of &#34;mini&#34; strokes on the right side of my brain, affecting the left side of my body.  I could no longer walk at all without aide of person or a walker,   After that I was taken to rebab, .  I was given pt, OT, etc, and discharged several days later. No doctor or staff could tell me whether this was caused by the vaccine but the close days of administering the vaccine and the sudden onset of symptoms make me very concerned.  How can I take a 2nd vaccine without knowing if that will have a worse effect  or kill me? Can I take a different vaccine for the 2nd round, without a risk of something worse happening? Can you report to me if there is any correlation at all between this vaccine and my mini strokes?

                                                71- year old woman with past medical significant for hypertension on 10 mg of Lisinopril daily for many years. She had her first dose of Pfizer vaccine two weeks prior to admission (3/11/21). After her vaccination, patient felt unwell and dizzy in the mornings. She felt persistent fatigue and had a decreased appetite. The week prior to admission she noticed a decrease in her urine output. She denied NSAID use. Her primary care physician ordered blood week and her Cr was found to be 16.54 and BUN of 163, phosphate of 17.5. Her last known Cr prior to her admission was 18 months prior and was 1.17. She was asked to present to the emergency room. Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis or stones. Urinalysis showed 1&#43; protein, spec grav of 1.023 with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 0.09. Urine sediment was unremarkable. Her temperature was 95.6 and her BP was as low as 75/46 and she was put on a low dose of levo. CRP was 202.3. COVID was negative. CK wnl.  ANA &#43; to 1:160 (dsDNA, Smith, RNP, SS-A, SS-B all negative). Blood smear was negative. Cultures were all negative. Echo showed an EF of 68% with trivial pericardial effusion. Patient was oliguric, and then initiated on hemodialysis. Renal biopsy was performed.   The biopsy consists of one fragment which is stained with H&amp;E, PAS, Trichrome, Jones Silver, and HPS stains. Review of all stains reveals 12 glomeruli, one of which is globally sclerotic. The architecture of the kidney is well-preserved. There is  interstitial fibrosis with proportional atrophy involving 10% of the biopsy tissue. There is a focal interstitial infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes involving &lt;5% of the interstitium. The tubules show diffuse acute tubular injury.  Calcium oxalate  crystals are present in seven tubular profiles. The glomeruli show expansion of Bowman&#39;s capsule. The mesangium shows normal cellularity. The vessels show no abnormalities.   IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY:   Frozen sections are stained for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q, kappa, lambda, and fibrinogen. All immunofluorescence stains are negative.   ELECTRON MICROSCOPY:   Specimens are prepared for electron microscopy and semi-thin sections stained with toluidine blue are reviewed prior to thin sectioning for ultrastructural examination. Electron microscopy demonstrates patent capillary loops. The glomerular architecture  demonstrates segmental corrugation of basement membranes with increase in lamina rara interna.  No subepithelial deposits and no intramembranous deposits are identified. The tubules show dilated mitochondria and injury. There is segmental effacement of  foot processes. There are no subendothelial deposits. Mesangial electron dense deposits are not identified.   Patient received three dialysis treatments and Creatinine began to improved down to 1.46 within 8 days.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 27Feb2021 (Lot:EN6198, expiry:30Jun2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation; and potassium, via an unspecified route of administration, start and stop date, batch/lot number and dose were not reported for an unspecified indication. Medical history included ongoing non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Concomitant medications included atenolol taken for cardiomyopathy, magnesium (MAGNESIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, and furosemide, potassium chloride (LASIX &#43; K) taken for an unspecified indication. The patient was diagnosed cellulitis and was prescribed with cortisone and antibiotics, she was taking 2 antibiotics, named one as Bactrim and unable to name second one, possibly Cefaxin. She was prescribed with prednisone now. She was wondering if the prednisone would interact with the vaccine. Patient had blood work and everything was normal, including new blood tests yesterday. Went off a particular medication, had been on a high dose of Magnesium because she was taking Lasix and Potassium so this test was checking all of that. She hasn&#39;t heard back regarding the test yet but is not anticipating any problems. Patient wanted to know if she should take an antibody test to determine if she already gained immunity then she could take her prednisone. It was also reported that about 5 or 6 days before her second shot, which was this past Saturday, she went to her orthopedic doctor and got 2 shots of Cortisone, 1 in each shoulder. Patient had fallen a week before her doctor thought there was a hairline fracture not picked up on the first X-ray. Stated she was supposed to start prednisone and was reading the pamphlet. Patient wanted to know if this would interfere and if taking steroids after the vaccine will interfere with the efficacy of the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

Later moved to a private room with a recliner where nurse continued to monitor her every few minutes. Nurse called an emergency room doctor around 3:30PM to see if she needed to be transferred to the hospital emergency room. The emergency room doctor told the nurse to continue monitoring her where she was, and as long as her blood pressure did not go any higher, or nothing else happened, she could go home. Patient blood pressure went down to 130 and she was released from the COVID-19 Vaccine waiting area at 5:30PM. Patient experienced a headache and was extremely tired and had a sore arm. Patient spoke to one of her doctors and they mentioned having the Moderna vaccine for her second dose and one of her doctors told her to take the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose, while another doctor told her not to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Patient asked if she should get her second vaccine dose if she experienced a reaction to the first also if her BP will go up again with the second vaccine dose because she was afraid it will do it again and asks whether she should take the Moderna instead. Patient asked if she still need to stay away from my new grandson, should wait 21 days after first dose, and should still wear a mask or she was protected.

Patient lab tests included blood pressure (180, later came down to 130), triglycerides (over 300) on 28Jan2021, cholesterol and Haemoglobin (6.4) on an unspecified date. The patient did not take any other vaccine on that same day, as well as four weeks prior vaccination. The patient had hoped to get the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her primary care doctor told her to take the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, but she couldn&#39;t find anyone who she could register with. The outcome of the events dizziness and systolic blood pressure increased was recovered for and unknown for all other events.

The patient did not receive any other vaccinations on the same day or within 4 weeks of the vaccine. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) as pre-medication since she had allergic reactions to some things and would get this before the flu shot; as well as salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA) for runny nose and coughing.

She was more anxious when &#34;that stuff&#34; appeared on the news on day 4 and 5 after the vaccine. She took a small dose of clonazepam 0.5 mg, dividing the pill in 4 pieces as she never took the whole thing. She took it when she got extremely anxious and tried not to take it because it can be habit forming. She may take it 3 times a week or in the middle of the night. It helped a little bit, but she still felt panicky and upset. She woke up feeling anxious. She did not normally take these medications.

She was having worsening anxiety because she had not been feeling well for so long, going on 7 weeks. She visited her physician&#39;s office 6,7, or 8 times. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included an ultrasound of the leg (did not have a blood clot), an X-Ray of the back (unknown results) and an MRI of the back (did not find anything) to determine the pain. The physician thought it might be a compression fracture, but the MRI did not show anything. The patient was tested for antibodies on 05Apr2021 and had zero antibodies.

But I&#39;m on blood thinners (further clarified and captured in medical history, hence not captured as suspect product in the tab), so I didn&#39;t think anything of it and a little pain but it went away. And then, this past Monday, which is into my third week, I have a horrific pain in the back of my neck and head into my neck and it&#39;s not a headache. It&#39;s pain and it&#39;s in the back of my head and into my neck and I can&#39;t turn my neck, right or left or up or down. It hurts to open my mouth, and it almost hurts to swallow and I am wondering if this is a reaction, so they have a delayed reaction. Is this swollen lymph nodes?&#34; The patient stated, &#34;I had lab work done this past Monday. I have no results yet.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of bruise, pain, have horrific pain in back of my neck and head into my neck and not a headache; I can&#39;t turn my neck, wondering hurts to open my mouth and swallow which included ice packs and Aspirin.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 at a single dose in the hospital for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety, seizures, and high cholesterol. She passed out last summer and they put her in the hospital from 31Aug2020 and ran all kinds of tests. In the end, they said she only had a few PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) and she doesn&#39;t need to see the doctor for a year. Mentioned she also has chronic bronchitis and this is related to having low platelet count and low immunity. All of these events predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin for high cholesterol, clonazepam for seizures, escitalopram for anxiety, levothyroxine sodium for thyroid, and mirtazapine for sleep; all were ongoing. Stated that she had something weird happen after her injection about four hours after the shot. She received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 in the right arm. About three or four hours later on 13Jan2021, she was getting ready for bed and when she sat down and leaned over she had a god awful burning in her chest and nausea. She was going to take baking soda but when she sat up she had horrible pressure and pain in her chest and felt woozy so she sat on the floor and then the pain started to radiate through her arm and into her neck. The horrible pain and pressure in her chest felt like something was sitting on her chest and the bad pain in her chest was going into her arm and a little into her neck. She laid real still on the floor, and did a lot of praying, and then 20 minutes later it totally stopped. She got up slowly and finished getting ready for bed and was fine. She was just hoping they will still let her get the second shot. The whole event only lasted 20 minutes and when it was over it was completely gone. She did tell her husband when he came home. She was alone when this happened. The patient wanted to know if she can receive second dose of vaccine. She stated it almost felt like a heart attack. She was planning to get the second dose on 03Feb2021. Wanted to know if her effect will preclude her from getting the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.

She sees the date of when she is supposed to return for her second vaccine, 04Feb2021. She sees the lot number and then it has (name of center). The actual dose is unknown, she knows this is her first dose. She also receives infusions for her arthritis. She receives an infusion at a facility once a month, she used to receive it less than that, but her arthritis has been really bad, so she now does it once a month. She was supposed to go today but she didn&#39;t go because she didn&#39;t feel good. She had three COVID tests done because she had the sinus situation going on. A COVID test was done yesterday (14Jan2021) and it was negative. Another one was done when she had a gastric endoscopy on 09Dec2020. This test was also negative. She doesn&#39;t remember if she had another one in Dec2020 when she was at the emergency center, but all of her COVID tests have been negative. The patient has not recovered from headache. Outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

The pain was severe and I wasn&#39;t able to walk for two days and even now, 9 days later, it still is giving me some pain. I don&#39;t remember hurting myself and I have no idea if the vaccine has anything to do with what happened, but I was told to report it . I called my healthcare provider and they told me to call the health dept and the health dept told me to go online and fill out this form.

                                                I woke at 3AM Thursday morning and I had terrible pain in left arm, it down to hand and it was tinging. I took some ibuprofen and the numbness in my hand went away and it did not help with the pain. I got about 4 AM to shower and after my husband got up. I couldn&#39;t raise my arm at all and it was hurting bad. I went the ER about 7-8AM on Thursday.  I went to ER and the doctor suspected it to may be a side effect of COVID 19 vaccine. I am doing what they are saying, applying heat and taking Ibuprofen and I am trying to move it. I can lift my arm sometimes I can and sometimes I can&#39;t. The pain hasn&#39;t improved much. I can&#39;t lay on it at night because it hurts so bad. The weird thing is after I got the vaccine it hurt the first day and then it went away until the pain came back on Thursday. Monday and Tuesday before I went to ER my migraines were uncontrollable and my prescription medication was not helping, my migraine usually goes away after I take the medication. The headache was so bad I ended up taking 5 of them each day.   I did not have any side effects with the first dose of the vaccine.

Medical history included her left eye had a virus that was finally taken care of back in Mar2020 but took a year and a half to heal. She had 5 surgery on that eye from an unspecified date. Also, her left lymph node got filled with fluid and was swollen but the doctors were not concerned about it. She would see an ENT for this. The patient has been seeing a neurologist who has done brain scans and MRI&#39;s due to the loss of peripheral vision do to eye problems. The patient has no allergies and is basically healthy. Concomitant medications include unspecified &#34;natural stuff&#34;. The reporter stated she had a pretty bad reaction with the vaccine and it took 3 days to get over, her neck froze up. She woke on 22Jan2021 with the frozen neck. She got the first shot on Thursday, 21Jan2021, and on Friday morning, 22Jan2021, when she woke up she could not look up, down, left or right. It was like her neck was frozen or paralyzed, the muscles would not move. Any effort to move her neck would send shooting pain in her head. She applied a heating pad, took Aleve, she took a couple of them, a massager, biofreeze, and stayed in bed. She was doing anything to loosen the muscles. The next morning she was able to look up and down but still not left or right. She did the same thing for treatment that day. On Sunday, 24Jan2021, she was better, was able to move her head 3 of 4 directions. She continued with the treatment she had been using and by Monday, 25Jan2021, her muscles loosed up and her neck worked again. She was sure it is muscles and when she called her neurologist confirmed it was a muscle issue. She was in a lot of pain in her head and neck. The patient was under care for her neck and head and wondered if this happened because this was a weak area, she did not know if related. The patient remarked she was scared to get the second dose due to the problems she had with the first. She heard that the second dose was the one with worse side effects. She was in bed 3 days with this first one. It was reported that the events did not require a visit to Emergency Room, and required visit to physician office. Patient called the neurologist due to the pain and was told to go to acute care to evaluate but she didn&#39;t go. The patient stated that this was scary like waking up with Bells palsy and was wondering if she would ever get better. She has never had anything like this happen to her before. She has to be attributed it to the shot. The patient needed guidance on getting the second dose, and had questions about side effects. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                vertigo;   This is a report from an interventional study sponsored by BioNTech, managed and reported by Pfizer on the sponsor&#39;s behalf. The subject was in open-label phase of the study when the event occurred. A 72-year-old female subject received first and second dose of blinded therapy vaccine (BNT162; PLACEBO) on 31Aug2020 and 21Sep2020 respectively. She then received third dose of study vaccine (BNT162B2) on 13Jan2021 at 15:48 and fourth dose of study vaccine (BNT162B2) on 02Feb2021 at 11:50, both intramuscularly on left deltoid as single doses, all for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included insomnia from 2010 and ongoing, sleep apnea from 2010 and ongoing, left knee osteoarthritis from 2014 to 2017 (with left total knee arthroplasty), osteoporosis from 2016 and ongoing and basal cell carcinoma on nose in 2018. No concomitant vaccines or prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were received. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event (AE) was unknown. Ongoing concomitant medications included estradiol (ESTROGEL) as hormone replacement from 2019, denosumab (PROLIA) for osteoporosis from 2017, zolpidem tartrate (AMBIEN) for insomnia from 2010; and ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), zinc, vitamin B6, quercetin and glucosamine, all as health supplement from Mar2020.  On 03Feb2021, the subject experienced vertigo with serious criteria of medically significant and hospitalization. The event required a visit to emergency room. The clinical course was as follows: Around midnight on 03Feb2021, the subject did not feel well with severe chills. She got up out of bed and went to the bathroom. She experienced vertigo, fell and hit her head. She was found bleeding by her husband who called the ambulance. She was taken to the hospital and had 7 stitches placed. She was still in the hospital at the time of the report. The action taken in response to the event for study vaccine BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of event was not recovered.  The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility that the event vertigo was related to the study vaccine but not related to concomitant drugs or clinical trial procedure.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event &#34;Vertigo&#34; is unlisted in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD) of the Investigational Product therapy vaccine (BNT162B2).  The information provided is very limited and mainly anecdotal. Results of the diagnostic workup during hospitalization are not available. The company considers there is not a reasonable possibility that the event, vertigo, is related to vaccine administration based on the latency, the circumstances and a possible role of concomitant medication zolpidem.  Pfizer&#39;s safety database was reviewed for cases reporting PF-07302048 or blinded therapy through 15-JAN-2021 for adverse events encoding to MedDRA (v.23.1J) Preferred Term(s) of Vertigo. Review of the database for the PT Vertigo had the following results: 2 serious clinical trial cases (0 of which were attributed to therapy) and 109 non clinical trial cases.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committee and Investigators, as appropriate.

I threw up midway, and then just slept. Felt a little better around 2:00 pm, took Tylenol at 4:00pm and that helped a lot. Got out of bed at 5:00 pm. Was able to eat a little dinner at 6:00 pm.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 10:00AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020 and lost taste and smell. Reported she tested positive for the COVID-19 Virus in Nov2020. She said she was never sick during the time she had the COVID-19 Virus, though she lost her sense of taste and smell. She said she may have had a headache during that time, but she doesn&#39;t know if the headache was from the COVID-19 Virus or something else. She said anything she was experiencing during the time she had the COVID-19 Virus was kind of normal for her. Concomitant medications were none. Reported she got her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 22Jan2021, and thinks she may be having an adverse reaction. She said after she received her COVID-19 Vaccine, she was OK for the remainder of Friday, 22Jan2021, as well as, Saturday morning, 23Jan2021. Reported she was working outside the day before she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose (21Jan2021). She clarified she had a tree cut down in her yard, and she moved all the 3 foot length cut-up pieces of tree by herself. She had been moving tree cuttings. Her arm was mildly sore. Reported on Saturday (23Jan2021) in the middle of supper, she experienced a horrible pain in her left back. She clarified that the pain was above her left kidney, and the pain ran from the bottom of her left rib cage to the bottom of her left butt cheek. She said the pain was so bad she didn&#39;t think she was going to be able to finish eating supper. She said after supper she got on a heating pad and walked around the kitchen to see if that would help with the pain. She said she sat on the heating pad and walked around the kitchen 4 times that night. She said by Sunday (24Jan2021), the pain started to go away, and by Sunday night, she was OK. Reported this past Thursday, 28Jan2021, she was going to her mailbox. She said while she was walking out to her mailbox, she was holding onto her front porch post to go down the front porch stairs, and her left leg collapsed out from under her. She said she would have fallen if she wasn&#39;t holding on to the front porch post. She said she tried to continuing walking to the mailbox, and her left knee went out from under her again. She said her left leg kept wanting to buckle under her. She said after she got back inside her house, she sat down in a chair to read a book. She said she was making soup at the time and grabbed her husband&#39;s cane to walk to the kitchen. She said she is short and got on her 2-step stool to look in the freezer for vegetables. She said while she was on the top step of the stool, her left knee buckled and her left leg went out from under her. She said she fell straight back, landing on the floor. She said she has 2 big bruises on arm, 1 bruise at her elbow and 1 bruise on her upper arm. She said her left leg went out from under her again, yesterday (31Jan2021), while she was going to church. She said everything she has experienced since getting her COVID-19 Vaccine shot is only happening on her left side. Reported her left knee keeps wanting to go out and she has to be really careful when she walks. She said her left knee feels like it is wanting to buckle, like when someone runs up behind you and hits the backside of your knee. She said her left leg muscle is sore from above her left knee. She said she doesn&#39;t know if what she is experiencing is from getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and she wanted to know if anyone else has reported a similar experience since receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. For fall treatment, she took a couple of Aleve 220mg tablets (UPC Number: 325866555090, Lot Number: NAA6W3T, Expiration Date: Jun2021) on 28Jan2021, after she fell off her stool.  Reported she took another 2 Aleve 200mg tablets last night (31Jan2021) at 11:00PM. Reported she is pretty darn healthy and only takes 3 pills. No other details provided. Reported she is trying to lock her left knee when she walks, saying she can feel her left knee giving away.  She said she while she was walking down a small ramp at church on Sunday (31Jan2021) her left knee wanted to buckle from under her. She said she had to hold onto a railing while she was walking down the ramp, so she wouldn&#39;t fall. She said she is not used to her left knee trying to go out from under her. The reported adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of events &#34;horrible pain in her left back/ pain was above her left kidney, and the pain ran from the bottom of her left rib cage to the bottom of her left butt cheek&#34; (back pain, rib pain, and buttocks pain) was recovered on 24Jan2021.

I hope this does not continue off and on.

Day 6, 01Mar21, worked at computer for 15 minutes, became dizzy and with brain fog. Did the strain in my immune system rekindle symptoms from the April 2019 concussion? From then on, I used my sunglasses when working at computer.  Day 8, 03 March 2021, resumed half of a mild weight-lifting routine. Days 9, 10 and 11, 4-6Mar 2021, forced napping,  lethargy, some brain fog. This pattern, light exercise or chores followed by day(s) of lethargy and napping, closely resembles April through September 2020&#43;plus as I recovered from what appeared to be COVID-19 in March 2020. The test at that time was negative.   Day 12, Sunday I learned about this site. Today, Day 13, I&#39;m a bit lethargic but OK, having done nothing since Friday. Haven&#39;t yet attempted any significant chore.

                                                Immediately upon leaving the COVID shot parking lot at Hospital, I began to feel pain shooting down my arm all the way to my fingertips. Then I started to feel disoriented. Then, as I was driving myself home, I felt constriction in my chest, like I was barely holding onto consciousness, then pain shooting up my shoulder into the left side of my neck, the left side of my face, my left eye and into the left side of my head. My heart was pounding, my head was hurting intensely and I wondered whether I was having a stroke while trapped in stop and go traffic. The intense pain continued while I drove, for about 30 minutes. Then it subsided somewhat -- but continued through the evening. I could not get to The pain continued in my arm, up the left side of my body and into my head all night. I could not sleep. My heart was pounding. Somehow I dozed off around 2 or 3am. The next day I felt groggy and tired, with the more moderate pain continuing in my arm and all the way to my hand. Finally, on Monday morning, I was able to reach my doctor&#39;s office. I was told to go the ER, which I did. They could find nothing &#34;emergent.&#34; The pain, tiredness and headaches continued through Thursday. Friday I started to feel better -- a week after the shot on Saturday, 2/27.

I was taken to the ER and monitored for a few hours and labs.  BP came down slowly, but not perfect.  I was released around 7pm.  Event happened at 3:46pm.  The next day I had chills first, then I had a slight fever, a terrible headache in the back of my head, dizziness and night sweats.  By the 2nd day after I  am feeling better.

                                                There were two adverse events, loss of muscle strength in abdomen, such that rising from a sitting to a standing position and then marshaling the muscles to walk was extremely difficult and I could not fully straighten my back once on my feet. This began on March 6 and lasted three days. The second was the development of a lump in the underside of my right metatarsal arch, which remains there. It is painful to the touch. I noticed it on March 8 or 9.

Event: Friday, March 12, 6:00 AM excruciating total left leg shooting pain with no relief or ability to ambulate. Saturday, March 13; friend took me to the Hospital ER upon my request. The non- stop pain was intolerable! I wanted X-Rays because I thought something somehow was broken. There was no fall or any accident of any kind. The X-Rays revealed strong arthritis &amp; sent me home w crutches &amp; an Ace bandage wrap. Recommended ice &amp;/or heat, otc Tylenol or naproxen, which I did all day. Sunday, March 14, I was 80% improved. I attribute this strong reaction as triggered out of the blue by the 2nd Pfizer dose!

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

                                                The morning following first dose I woke up with a headache, body aches, slight fever, dizzy &amp; nausea. These went on for the next week. I didn&#39;t go into work February 26th. But did go in partial days all the next week. Very uncomfortable. The headache got worse each day until it was very bad. On March 10th I woke up with my left arm in excruciating pain and the headache. Went to urgent care and doctor gave me a shot of Tromodol. When I got to the parking lot, I became very dizzy and my legs gave out and fell in the parking lot down to t he ground.  Went to ER and waited for about 3.5 hours and left and went home. Went back to ER on March 12th due to arm in constant pain. Not able to sleep or relax. Wait this time was 3 hours and I was in too much paid so my daughter took me around the corner to urgent care. I was given steroid, muscle relaxer and a cream for my arm. My left arm from muscle up to shoulder and into wrist continues to hut. Today is 3/18/2021.

Then driving home she started feeling itchy, and could feel little hives in each ear.  She was then very lethargic that night and all the next day Sunday, and then first thing Monday morning was covered with a large hives and a rash.  She was covered from one end of her body to the other and into her joints where she was not able to bend her joints.  She tried to use cortisone, but that made it worse.  Also tried Benadryl lotion and Calamine lotion, which also did not help.  She then went to the doctor and he prescribed steroids.  She has had pain as if somebody was sticking needles in her.  In the past 2 days her lips are numb and swelled, and on the right cheek plus her two eyes there is a big swollen area and her eyes are burning.  Now her entire body is peeling as if she had a bad sunburn.   Now her blood sugar due to the steroids is from 250-475.  The site of the vaccine itself was ok.

Then after second shot 3 weeks later, had 11 out of 12 days of migraine and after 8.5 days after shot had a whole body rash for 4.5 days .  I have had vertigo most every day since the last shot on 2/20 and have had 27 migraines since the 1st shot Jan 30th  I used Hydrocortisone on the itchy, blistery rash. Not much sleep for 3 nights.  The night before the rash popped out I experienced chest pain that I thought was heartburn but was not relieved with baking soda and water and charcoal pills.  It didn&#39;t go away until the hours into the next day and the rash was there at 3am.  I have had Migraines for many years but this is 4 times more migraines.

Joint pain increased, involving shoulders, hands, legs, arms, knees and hips. Left hand began swelling on January 23rd and continued so I could no longer see my knuckles and it ballooned and it was hot and very painful. The knees were so bad it was almost impossible to stand from a sitting position and walking was stiff. Could not sleep laying down because pain in shoulders and knees would increase.   I went to the doctor on the 26th.   he prescribed Prednisolone for one week and I am scheduled to see him next Tuesday February 2nd.

A 73-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 10Jan2021 and didn&#39;t have a reaction, but had a slight pain in her arm on 10Jan2021. Her sore arm started on 11Jan2021. There was a sore spot and when she would pick up her arm it was sore and achy. No pain, but sore and achy. It lasted for a day or two. She didn&#39;t have any symptoms until Saturday the 16Jan2021, this past Saturday she thought she was dying. She had chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and had a headache. She thought she was losing her mind. The headache just stopped today. She had the chills that would not stop and she thinks she broke the sweat on Sunday (17Jan2021). She had a little nausea and couldn&#39;t eat anything on 16Jan2021. She had a terrible headache, which just stopped about 2 hours ago. She stated she must have to take 10 Tylenol over the course of time, every 4 hours. On Saturday 16Jan2021 she was just laying on the floor in pain. She was not even eating, just drinking water. All of her symptoms stopped this morning around 5 AM (18Jan2021). She had a big sweat. She is unsure if she had a fever because she does not have a thermometer. She is unsure if she has recovered completely from these symptoms. She feels weak, and is still weak (on Jan2021). She cannot go out or get dressed or shower. She is not strong enough. She is just sitting up now, no longer laying in bed. She couldn&#39;t walk (on Jan2021) and was afraid she was going to faint on 16Jan2021. She can walk a little bit now and feels a little bit better. She has been out of it for three days, She hasn&#39;t felt good. She asked if side effects can appear 6 days later? Is this normal to have a reaction 1 week after getting it? She asked are the side effects worse after the second dose? She asked is this Covid or side effects, what are the COVID symptoms? She asked should she take the second one if she had these side effects? Caller clarifies this is the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Whoever vaccinated her did not give her the paper about it afterwards. Her neighbor brought it to her cause they went together. She did not realize she could experience these things. She did not expect them a week after getting the vaccine. She thought she had COVID. She asks, &#34;do you think I have COVID?&#34; She is just now getting better and it has been 3 days of experiencing these symptoms. Should she get the second vaccine? She is trying to do the right thing. Event outcome of chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and headache was recovered on 18Jan2021, for was going to faint and couldn&#39;t walk was recovering, for weak was not recovered, while for others was unknown.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization, pregabalin (LYRICA, Pfizer product), phenytoin sodium (DILANTIN, Pfizer product), levetiracetam (KEPPRA, non-Pfizer product), all via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unspecified dose for an unspecified indication.   Medical history included Major Epilepsy issues from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included sertraline hydrochloride (Generic of Zoloft). The patient got the shot, she had no pain or anything like that but she increasingly today has not been able to take straight steps forward, she walks like she is drunk. She is on Lyrica, she is on Dilantin and she is on Keppra and the reporter was wondering if there is any relationship between the actions we are seeing from her today from the shot and concerned if that could be a reaction. The patient did not have the second dose yet. The patient had pneumonia in Dec so she was checking for potassium levels but the reporter didn&#39;t know if the patient did a CBC or what other. Treatment: Reporter stated, &#34;It just started today.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included potassium levels and blood work with unknown results. The action taken in response to the events for pregabalin, phenytoin sodium and levetiracetam was unknown. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283, expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 10:02 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Seasonal Allergies (probably started in the last 4-5 years; reoccurs every year from about Oct through Mar), ongoing high blood pressure since like 2006 or 2004, ongoing Iliac artery stent placed started couple of years ago, anxiety from 2010 and ongoing (her cardiologist put her on Xanax around 2010-ongoing). Concomitant medication included ongoing alprazolam (XANAX) since 2010 for anxiety. She gets the flu shot every year and has never had a problem with the flu shot. She got her last flu shot in Oct2020, no adverse events with that or other flu shots historically. On the second dose of Pneumococcal vaccine, it swelled her arm up from the injection site all the way down to her wrist; she went to the urgent care for that. They gave her some medicine and eventually the adverse event went away. She experienced some side effects following that injection. The patient reported that in the morning of the 20Jan2021, she was weak and just kind of rested. She did not have any other side effects until 21Jan2021. At 5am on 21Jan2021, for the whole day she had a fast heart rate, 125bpm, she woke up with her heart rate up, fast heartbeat, then down to 110 and then just toggled a little bit, she had blurry eyes so she could not really focus her eyes, weakness and dizziness. These events continued all throughout 21Jan2021 but her heart rate came down, it was running in the 90s and she was weak all day. Her blood pressure was also up on 21Jan2021. She thinks the blurry eyes, with her eyes being squirrely was related to her heart rate being up and blood pressure being up. She feels like she recovered completely from these events by this morning 22Jan2021. She feels good, strong and her eyes are clear today, felt better than yesterday but not 100%. She has probably shrunk in height, her last known height was 5&#39; 9. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose as scheduled for 12Feb2021 in response to the side effects. Outcome of the event &#39;she has probably shrunk in height&#39; was unknown while the rest of the events was recovered on 22Jan2021.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

Also felt slight tightness in my head.  I begin to take my blood pressure which was well over what was normal for me.  BP ranged from highest of 155/84 to 145/78.  Blood pressure begin to lower as I begin to take my Blood Pressure medication doubling the dose from 5mg to 10mg Amlodipine. I also take the medication at night, versus my normal routine to take medication during the day.  Not sure if this was just a coincident or precipitated by the vaccine.

She had to go the bathroom a lot; Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening; muscle cramping and pulling; Her toes would contort and go backwards.; she feels like the left arm is going to do something, its like the last to be pulled; shingles; muscles became tight/contort; minor nausea; Stomach cramps; Gas; Indigestion; became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fever, being ill (deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks) and bug bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient is the type of person that takes a lot for her to take medications. She is allergic to a lot of things; she always has crazy reactions. She can&#39;t take morphine. It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn&#39;t think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn&#39;t breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can&#39;t describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn&#39;t drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn&#39;t take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn&#39;t like it. It wasn&#39;t like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, &#34;what is this Parkinson&#39;s?&#34;. She doesn&#39;t even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn&#39;t debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it&#39;s like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can&#39;t even think of what that area is, but it&#39;s the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don&#39;t atrophy or won&#39;t pull. She hasn&#39;t told anybody about it. She doesn&#39;t like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn&#39;t figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her &#34;brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep.&#34; On Monday she experienced, &#34;horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band.&#34; Stated that it wasn&#39;t a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of gas (flatulence), muscles became tight/contort, minor nausea, horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band and shingles. The outcome of the event &#39;the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot&#39; was not recovered while of the rest of the events was unknown.

                                                Tingling of fingers and numbness of left cheek.  Did not get any worse after 30 minutes. Extremely tired and sore arm that day.  Day 2 - tired easily, no stamina.  Dizzy and nauseous after showering at3:30 pm.  By 10:30, both hands were red and itched.  Sometime in the night woke with a very sharp, painful headache.  Did not last.  No real problem again until Saturday.  Nausea at 11:20 am.  Sunday I sat all day doing taxes - no symptoms noted.  Monday after walking - rapid heart rate and very tired after what is normal activity.  By 4:30 I was tingling all over my body.  Tuesday night my ankles are swollen for the first time in years.  Only happened that nigh.  Wednesday morning, the tingling is very strong in my calves. and I had a sharp pain in the area of my Achilles tendon.  I believe that the vaccine has exacerbated the neuropathy (undiagnosed) of the bottom of my feet.  Today I am reporting because I fell for no reason getting out of a chair, and the tingling is in my legs, arms, shoulders.  I had not heard until today that the vaccine could affect the nervous system.  The effects are the worst they have been and it has been one week since I had the vaccine.  Should I get the second shot?  Due March 11,2021.

                                                Dizzy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient herself). A 73-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 27Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose &#34;to not get the disease.&#34; Medical history included ongoing mood disorder and ongoing hypertension.

The patient previously took alprazolam (XANAX) for hypertension and had been trying to wean herself because she was getting addicted to it. Alprazolam (XANAX) also made her dizzy and depressed. She also previously took escitalopram (LEXAPRO), fluoxetine (PROZAC), and Zoloft  as antidepressants and stated that &#34;they drove her crazier.&#34; The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient received that vaccine at housing complex where she resides and was looking at the list that she was given that had reactions. She was feeling dizzy on 27Jan2021 and wanted to know if she should be concerned.

The event did not require visit to the emergency room or physician office. No relevant tests were conducted. The outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                irregular heart beat; congestion in the chest; dizzy/the dizziness she was having and feeling now after getting the vaccine was definitely more noticeable; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient). A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid/ left upper arm in the shoulder on 26Jan2021 around 14:00 (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: stroke about 4-5 years ago in June, dizziness, blood pressure. The patient also had difficulty writing stuff down; besides having a number issue, she had issues writing numbers down. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from an unspecified date and ongoing as a blood thinner. The patient stated she was on ten different medications. These medications were added after the stroke. Before the stroke she was not on any medication. The patient did not have any vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The patient got the pneumonia vaccine (unspecified), but thinks it was longer than 4 weeks before. She did not remember, but she believed it had been a month and a half to 2 months (at the age of 73-years-old) since getting the pneumonia vaccine for immunization. The patient had the COVID shot on Tuesday of this week (26Jan2021), and she didn&#39;t seem to have much of a reaction other than what they expected except at 21:00 that night, she got pretty dizzy. She was still dizzy now. It was enough for her to have to walk with a cane in order to try and keep herself leveled. She could not move quickly. She did not know why she had this reaction. She called her doctor the next day, and he did not understand why. She mentioned she was reading material and saw this could be a severe side effect/situation. The doctor mentioned they were trying to find out if it was related to the blood pressure. She wanted to know if this is part of the side effect, dizziness? When the patient was attempting to provide the zip code, she stated her mind was going blank and could not remember the zip code. She later found something with it written on it and provided those details.  She explained she had a stroke when trying to provide her current age. She stated numbers are hard for her. She stated she would be 74 in March, and questioned how old that would make her now, she later confirmed as 73. She read information today about the COVID vaccine, and she saw that one should be cautious about the vaccine if have a bleeding disorder, and she commented she was on a blood thinner. She went to the doctor last week and mentioned she was having dizziness. She clarified she had dizziness before getting the COVID-19 vaccine. When she went to the doctor, they thought it was due to blood pressure as the problem. They changed her blood pressure medication by placing on a higher dose. Then she started having more dizziness, and the dose was taken back down to the dose she was on before. She also added, she has an irregular heartbeat (unspecified date). She went to the doctor because of congestion in the chest (unspecified date); that was why she went to the doctor. The doctor asked about dizziness and she said she was having a little. However, the dizziness she was having and feeling now after getting the vaccine was definitely more noticeable. The clinical outcome of dizzy was recovering (as reported). The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

She has h/o elevated BP and &#34;flushed&#34; feeling with various meds including once when she was doing a bowel prep for a colonoscopy. We decided to monitor her for 30 minutes and she felt fine throughout. As she was walking to her car she felt &#34;flushed&#34; and a bit light headed so she returned to the monitoring area. Initial BP was 189/77, pulse 110, O2 sat 100%. We brought her to the back room so she could sit in a recliner and remove her mask. Subsequent BP 186/77, pulse 86 then 184/69, pulse 80 about 20 minutes later. O2 sat remained upper 90s to 100%.  She continued to report feeling &#34;flushed&#34; and noted pressure/pain behind her left eye so we elected to call EMS (and this was also patient request to go to the ED) so she could be evaluated. She drove herself to appointment. Her plan was to call her son to have him meet her at the ED. She left via ambulance in stable condition.

                                                Chronic fatigue and feeling cold like I can&#39;t get warmed up, but no fever, tense, jittery feeling with the coldness and fatigue gets worse as day goes by.  Hard to rest and relax because of the cold and tense feeling  This lasted the entire 3 weeks between dose 1 and dose 2.  I got dose 2 on Feb. 19 and have had same fatigue that isn&#39;t going away.  Fatigue and coldness is not worse with 2nd dose, but I heard that side effects were only supposed to last a few days.  To get warmed up I feel like I have to take a hot bath which also helps the tension.  Also later in the day I feel like I can&#39;t move properly, I just have to stay still, moving is too much of an effort.

Became lightheaded.  Could not sleep due to symptoms.  No appetite but drank herbal tea and water with added electrolytes.  That severity of symptoms lasted until 3/4 at 6 AM.  Still am having some  residual effects as one might have with the flu ? fatigue etc. Temperature is gone no more chills appetite still diminished.

(chalked it up to &#34;ND dry air).  March 24 at 1;30a.m. I awoke to a nose bleed my husband and I could not stop; went to ER and a catheter was placed in my nose  after an hour after they could not get it stopped. Catheter was removed next day.  Blood pressure 184/96 unusual for me range 120/80.  Side effect 2:  10 days after the 2nd vaccine I noticed loss of hearing in my right ear.  That has persisted but I have not taken any action on it.  My head is tender and I feel more &#34;off balance than normal&#34;.  Not sure if this coincidence or side effect.

                                                Covid Pfizer #2 was injected high into my right shoulder (bursa) area instead of the deltoid muscle area.   Unlike shot #1 on 02/16/21, where I could not even feel the needle in my left arm, this injection into my shoulder was immediately painful.  As the day progressed, my upper arm had to be massaged to reduce the pain, my wrist and fingers tingled, and I could not use my right arm for normal activities.  Overnight, I had difficulty finding a comfortable position for sleeping.  I fear a bursitis condition will develop requiring further treatment.

                                                Lightheaded/Dizziness within a few minutes of injection; This is spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EN6205, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 26Feb2021 12:00 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced lightheaded/dizziness within a few minutes of injection on 26Feb2021 at 12:00 PM.  The event resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient received unspecified treatment for the event following evaluation/transport to hospital. It was unknown if the patient received other vaccine in four weeks. It was unknown if patient had COVID prior to vaccination and if tested for COVID post vaccination. Outcome of the event was unknown. The event was assessed as serious (hospitalization).   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for event dizziness. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I began experiencing dizziness/vertigo when lying down or getting up.  This only lasted 30 seconds or less and improved after a few weeks.  Upon receiving my second vaccination on 3/16/21 the dizziness has immediately gotten a bit worse.  It has only been a few days since my second dose.  I also have a slight runny nose and a little sneezing after the second dose but this is veery minor.

                                                Got the vaccine and within 30-an hour she was seated, waiting and she developed a tingling/numbness on her bottom lip to the center of her lip.  It spread throughout the entire bottom lip.  Then it moved to the left hand corner of her mouth as well, and then moved up to the left side of her face to her eye, and then to the corner of the left hand of her head.  This is a tingly pressure, and it then developed into a hard headache concentrated in one spot.  She went into heavy sweating.  The pharmacist was watching her and came over to her, she was there for about an hour and a half.  She had a bottle of water trying to cool off, and her tongue was getting a bad taste in her mouth, and numbness in the back of her tongue.  The pharmacist gave her Benadryl to take and she sat there for a while and was starting to feel really shaky, and she thought she would go back to her apartment to get out of being around other people.  She was feeling weak to walk, and overwhelmingly tired.  Once she did get into her apartment she her taste buds felt dry.   After several days of this reaction, little by little it subsided, but the sweating and chills continue even up until today, 3/26/21.  She goes to bed dry and wakes up soaked from sweat due to profuse sweating.  She has been yawing a lot lately and if she does yawn she immediately has chills.  It&#39;s been back and forth with the chills/fever.  She can be perspiring on one end and the other end cold.  She tried to talk to her doctor but told her to seek out UC for her symptoms as he is too busy.    There is eye strain that is bothering her which leads her into wanting to sleep and sleeps for extended periods of time and really exhausted.  Has also had runny nose, hands and feet swelling.  Her right hand is kind of like a tingling/weakness sensation.

                                                Pfizer COVID-19 EUA Vaccine  Pt received first COVID vaccine 2/25/21. Tested positive for COVID late February. Reported to ED 3/5/21 with near syncope. Patient was seen emergency department laying in bed. The patient had a noticeable scalp laceration to posterior parietal area.  After being symptomatic with COVID-19 for a few days, the patient reports getting up at 5:00 a.m. to use the bathroom, feeling lightheaded, then ended up on the floor, she reports sitting on the floor and then hit her head at some point, but was not entirely sure of this timeline.  She states she ended up moving to the living room when she noticed that her head was bleeding a lot and her fiance called 911. She reports a history of syncopal episode in 2001 when she had influenza and apparently the story was much the same as this time, but she actually lost consciousness in 2001. Admitted to observation.    3/7: 73-year-old female recent COVID-19 infection admitted on 03/05/2021 for an episode of syncope probably secondary to bradycardia versus volume depletion.  Paramedic on arrival at home reported bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s but has been normal since admission. The CT angiogram of the chest done at the emergency room showed bilateral infiltrates compatible with recent COVID-19 infection.  No PE.  However patient has no respiratory symptoms and O2 saturation is perfectly normal.  Urinalysis was suggestive of infection and subsequent culture was positive for E coli and it is pansensitive.    She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  She was commenced on IV Rocephin and azithromycin.  The EP cardiologist was consulted and she recommended and echocardiogram and it revealed mild global hypokinesis with LVEF of 45-50% but patient denied any prior history of cardiac problem.   On re-evaluation this morning the vital signs remains normal.  Patient has not had any episode of bradycardia since she presented to the emergency room.  She will be discharged home follow up with the EP cardiologist for further evaluation. Patient does not need outpatient oral antibiotics as IV Rocephin for 3 days should be adequate for uncomplicated UTI.

A 73-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP7533), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 07Apr2021 at 13:30 (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included breast cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2 on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 73-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced Sore arm and feeling blah. Clinical course was as follows: She spent 50 years in neurology and neuroscience, she was a crazy RN that did neurology right out of school, she was recommended for that specialty. She is not sure if she had a reaction to the vaccine or if it is just her. Her 2nd dose was last Wednesday, 07Apr2021. She had a sore arm and felt blah. Just like after the 1st shot. On Saturday night (10Apr2021) at 0200, she was awakened with chills, cold sweat, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. She was sick as a dog for 2 days and didn&#39;t eat or drink much of anything. She went to the doctor who sent her to an infusion center. She is down to 5&#39; 2&#34; and weighed too much. She has not been able to lose weight for a couple years. She gained 40 pounds when she turned 50 years old. After the shot, she had a sore arm and felt blah like she did after the first dose, but she thought everyone felt that way. She missed a day of gym class because of her really sore arm. This got better like after a flu shot, it was nothing. This time she had a really sore arm and felt blah after the shot but then on Saturday morning this whole thing started happening. She woke up very restless, was all sweaty, cold, dizzy and was too miserable to try and take her blood pressure. Her blood pressure tends to run low. Her symptoms of the sore arm resolved at 06:00 Saturday (08Apr2021). She had nausea and vomiting and couldn&#39;t eat or drink. That lasted through Monday morning. She had some back pain with this, but she has back pain normally as she is a little old lady. She had a scheduled Oncology appointment Monday, as did her husband. She experienced orthostatic dizziness. She woke up plain dizzy. Her doctor gave her a liter of fluids and it helped her. This was something that needed to be addressed. It was serious. It was all serious. She had nothing left to vomit. She is an old lady with Breast Cancer. Her creatinine level of 1.10 which dropped her GFR of 52, she calculated the GFR using a computer program. This is what lead to the doctor giving her a liter of fluid. She had an appointment scheduled and her doctor sent her to the infusion centers for a liter of D5NS. She was sent home afterwards and encouraged to drink fluids. She also had a CBC and chemistry panel with her blood work. She was worried because her skin was tenting badly, and she couldn&#39;t keep anything down. She was probably dehydrated. Her blood pressure at the doctor&#39;s office was 82/50. She didn&#39;t care that her skin was tenting. She has been drinking a lot of fluids as advised after her liter of fluids at the infusion center.

Also add headache could not hardly stand to lay my head on the pillow. About 4 AM I could not tolerate the situation any longer and took 600 mg of Tylenol. After that was able to rest some. The next day after the vaccination my joints were achy moderately and I have a headache. The injection site was tender to the touch and arm range of motion decreased and arm sore. Took 400 ibuprofen about 4 PM day after injection to ease Reactions

A 74-year-old female patient received her second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot EL3248, expiration Apr2021) at 6:00AM on 07Jan2021 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had her first dose on 19Dec2020 and had side effects from it but very few. The patient was worked at COVID rooms to clean rooms in hospital as a housekeeper and so her exposer to the hospital made her in first group to get the vaccine. Medical history included allergies (had anaphylactic shock from Amoxicillin and from Tylenol, she cannot take Tylenol), anxiety, and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) on regular basis, bisoprolol fumarate, loratadine (CLARITIN) for allergies, escitalopram for anxiety, mometasone furoate (FLONASE) for allergies, losartan, magnesium, omeprazole, and triamterene. On the first day (07Jan2021) she had soreness more than usual from the shot, soreness in her arm, her neck. She got stiff neck, back, lower back. She had gotten the shot at 6 am, then worked at that time and by the time she got home at noon, she had massive weakness, some confusion, terrible sleepiness and by evening, she developed diarrhea. On the second day (08Jan2021) the pain increased the weakness increased, and she was running a temperature of 102. She could not even sit on the side of bed without falling to one side or the other or falling backwards so very weak and unable to move pretty much. She could not eat and lost appetite, and she developed the chills on that evening. On the third day (09Jan2021) she was running a temperature of 101 so it had gone down. She still had headaches, and pain around her face, her left arm and developed severe itching from head to toe, and on the next day (10Jan2021) she developed hives on her face, on her head, on top of her back and they also itch in addition to the all over itching. The temperature was gone, she had no temperature when she developed the hives. At the report day, she stated that she had not gone back to work as she broke out in the horrible hives and she still did not feel good. Only cold ice packs on the hives/ itching and no more treatment received for the events. The fever and itching resolved on 10Jan2021, and outcome of all other events was unknown.

By evening head movement was very difficult, I could not sleep in bed that night. I slept on the couch sitting up trying to immobilize head. During the night pain spread into the base of my skull. I applied heat to help relieve the pain and tightness. On 01/20/21 the pain (6 of 10) spread into the left side of neck and skull, it became difficult to eat, swallow and to get up from couch. I tried to sit motionless most of the day. On 01/21/21 the pain (6 of !0) moved down into my left rear shoulder, I continued to apply heat and immobilize sitting on couch, eating and swallowing still difficult. On 01/22/21 pain in neck and base of Additional information for Item 18:  skull subside to level 5, movement of head still difficult, able to to get up and move slowly. Could not lift head to drink, still needed to use straw. Slept on couch again this night. On 01/23/21 pain still subsiding to level 4, head movement still difficult, still needed straw to drink, slept on couch again. On 01/24/21 pain continuing to subside to level 3, head movement still difficult, still needed straw to drink, slept on couch again. On 01/25/21 conditions unchanged. On 1/26/21 pain subsided to level 2, head movement stiff but not difficult, swallowing less difficult but still need straw to drink. Slept in bed for first time since 01/19/21. On 01/27/21 pain continued to subside to level 1, head movement improved but still limited, still need straw to drink, able to move around more freely but still not normal. Improvement is slow but I hope to be back to normal in a few days.

                                                I had significant vertigo lasting 5 days. This is on the CDC list to ?call your physician?.  I was not dizzy-by definition but vertiginous -trying to turn over in bed made my head feel like it was spinning. I think this is much more common than reported. As a physician in the community people frequently reach out to me for advice and I  have been told several times about serious  vertigo in elderly people with new onset after Covid immunization.  I have no intention to delay or abort my second dose. My only current symptoms is fuzzy headedness that is sporadic. The elderly might need to be warned about this and advised accordingly-re not to drive etc. i am former physician and after TNTC immunizations in the past this was unique.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 16Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had her first COVID19 vaccine dose. Immediately, on 16Jan2021, she felt very cold and unwell. She also experienced dizziness, headache that started right after the shot, extreme fatigue that started later in the day and fogginess that started right after the shot. Strong chills was not going away almost like a feeling of ice in her veins. She is taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for these. The events were not improving. She was just surprised, she was ok with a day&#39;s worth, but it was hanging on dizziness (not enough to fall down), but she has to hold onto a rail to go upstairs which was not normal. She doesn&#39;t feel like she is real anchored. Headache was described as very bad and is not changing. Foggy brain was described as she was not able to focus very well. She was not able to get work done on Jan2021 due to extreme fatigue and foggy brain. She also experienced arm ache at the site on 06Jan2021 for which the patient expected. It is reducing some, the ache is not as bad as it was while the other things seem to be growing and it is still there. She had to be set aside when she took the shot, because she had these reactions after she got the shot. She had to be watched because of her almost immediate reactions. The patient wants an advice on what to do now, if there is any help for the side effects, and if this will go away. It was very disturbing and interfering with ability to do work. Outcome of the vaccination site pain was recovering while of the remaining events was not recovered.

                                                I became dizzy and then nauseous, increasingly dizzy.  When I told  my husband that I was getting up to go to the restroom, perhaps to throw up, I found that I couldn&#39;t walk or make my arms and legs move in a controlled way.  He helped me to a  resting place on the floor. I asked him to call 911.  I thought that I was having a stroke.  Emergency personnel treated it as  a pot overdose, because I told them that I had a bite of a pot brownie a couple of hours earlier.  It was really a little piece and I doubt that it would be enough to have these results.  I developed spasms throughout my body. My hands were unable to do tasks.  I did throw up once at the hospital.  I think that the pot issue was parallel but not necessarily the cause.  I received IVs.  One med was for nausea, Not sure what all.  I went home about 1 AM after dizziness had lessened and spasms had stopped. Today I am  a  wobbly and  weak, but no spasms.  And I can walk and control my arms.

The patient previously took Flu vaccine (Injection site was left arm, intramuscularly) in Oct2018 and experienced pain in injection site and redness in arm; took the first dose of BNT162B2 with lot number: EL3246, intramuscularly in left arm site at 09:00 on 08Jan2021. Clinical course: After the second dose of vaccination, patient noticed tenderness at vaccinate site at 13:00 and had pain in arm on 28Jan2021, but on 29Jan2021, the pain was worse, and she had difficulty lifting her right arm at 16:00. On 30Jan2021, she started noticing more pain when she lifted her arm, her arm pits, it was hurting under arm when she was lifting. She thought maybe there were swollen glands but did not feel it. her temperate was 100.8, and she took some paracetamol (TYLENOL), by the evening, her temperature was at 98.6 normal. On 31Jan2021, she noticed a lot of pain, itching and redness, redness moved from actual site down her arm about 6 to 7 inches at 14:00. The pain in her right arm was not as bad as it was, but the redness in the area and itching was there, it was hot to touch area on right arm, and she tried cold compresses and took paracetamol. Also, it was hurting under her arm when she was lifting. She experienced something like that before with a Flu vaccine. She noticed when she looked it up, the information states, yes. And it was still going on today, not so much pain, just swelling and redness, looked like what Moderna calls a covid arm. She had no temperature, a little headache on 31Jan2021 at the back of the head and tired, very tired, she was tired from 29Jan2021, and was better from 01Feb2021. She took paracetamol last night, and cold compress. she used to take baby aspirin; she didn&#39;t know if it would be a problem. She read not to take paracetamol or ibuprofen before vaccination. She felt tugging and redness when she raised her arm, it was not red its blotchy. She didn&#39; t feel any swelling. The last 7 to 8 months, she was running high blood counts, 12.3 (high) and she had no infection, her doctor was a little nervous, the last one on 15Jan2021, it was down to 10.2 within normal range. Her immune system was very active. She had a flu shot in Oct2018 at age of 72 y/o and by 08Jun months later, she got the flu. She went to the hospital and developed PNA. In 2019 and again this past Aug2020, she had a Colonoscopy where they removed polyps. She had a flat polyp that was a little more dangerous the first time and it was removed. It was non-cancerous. The doctor was just watching it. Last blood results were 2 weeks prior to having first shot on 15Jan2021. The only thing that showed was her Liver enzymes were a little elevated. She was told that if she hadn&#39;t gotten the vaccine, it would have been worse, her doctor gave me the zpack. They were calling it a subcutaneous sensitivity, she had eczema, she forgot to mention that. She was taking calcium 1200mg, she forgot to tell her that also. The outcome of events pain in arm, redness and feeling hot was not recovered; of events tiredness, body temperature increased, itching and headache was recovering; of rest events was unknown.

A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 15:30 in left arm at single dose as Covid vaccine, etanercept (ENBREL, 50 mL/mg, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen, lot number: 1119808, expiry date: Apr2023) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 DF weekly to the stomach area for rheumatoid arthritis, methylprednisolone (MEDROL, tablet) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 3 mg, daily (1.5 tablets daily for total of 3 mg) for rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate (tablets) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, weekly (2.5 mg tablets, 20 mg total) for rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity) and took levothyroxine, rheumatoid arthritis. She had had regular blood work for rheumatoid arthritis and that was normal for her, they were relatively normal and her ESR was down. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included levothyroxine daily for endocrine abnormalities. It was a daily thing for the body and the body couldn&#39;t live without it if it did not have it. The patient previously took the Shingrix vaccine and it was terrible for her and put her into a rheumatoid arthritis flare and was taking prednisone and was getting better and the wap she was in a rheumatoid flare. No prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient was taking 3 medicines for rheumatoid arthritis that might or might not affect the RNA in the vaccine. She wondered if etanercept would have an effect on the vaccine since it was shipped on ice overnight. She did not think they would affect anything. Nobody has said anything about the medications and she just wanted to get the vaccine. Her doctor knows nothing about the interactions and none of them seem to know if it is normal to have these symptoms 4 days after getting the vaccine. She felt great the first 2 days after getting the vaccine and then began to feel a little bad. She was having some symptoms maybe 4 days on 01Feb2021 after receiving the Covid vaccine and wanted to know if that was sort of normal. It was unusual for her, but she had nauseous, not dizziness, but unsteadiness, tired, also headaches and generally didn&#39;t feel well. She felt like she might have the stomach flu, but had not had that in so many years. She also felt weak. No temperature. Gentle muscle ache. On 01Feb2021 Monday night she had the nausea. On 02Feb2021 Tuesday, she had it again, and had it again today and almost threw up last night. Just the malaise or tiredness had gotten worse. She could not tell the difference between the rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain and muscle pain and this with the vaccine. She was having a few little odd pains, but nothing that she hadn&#39;t had before. It was more of a soft pain, they made her feel weak and then they went away. It was more muscle than joint. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was supposed to get a second dose but felt she shouldn&#39;t, it might put her back into a rheumatoid flare. She was just getting over it and afraid to go through that with the Covid vaccine also. The action taken in response to the events for etanercept, methylprednisolone and methotrexate was dose not changed. The outcome of events nausea, unsteadiness, tired (tired was reported as worsened), generally does not feel well, feels like the stomach flu, weak, few little odd pains; soft pain, joint pain was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

About 2 weeks after the first vaccine I began to be dizzy, nauseous and had diarrhea.  Eventually a brain MRI showed an inflamed meninges and numerous test were done, including MRI, CT and lumbar puncture but there has been no answer.  It has been suggested I had the Prolia  shot too soon after the first vaccine but no one can give me an answer.  I am still suffering from dizziness and minor nausea.

Cold sweats, severe aching and muscle weakness especially in legs, nauseous, severe headache. I tried to drink a little water. Didn&#39;t have enough energy and was too cold to get up to  get any medication. Slept a little. I was awake early in the morning, but too cold to get out of bed. At 8:30 a.m. I got up and could hardly walk. Dizzy, muscle weakness as if muscles had turned to Jell-O.. Sat down and threw up, mostly dry heaves, which lasted a few minutes. Fitful sleep until 11:00 a.m. when I began to feel better. Drank more water and just rested for a few hours. I ate some applesauce and made a batch of white rice which I ate around 6:00 p.m. Achiness in lower extremities continued until bedtime (10:00 p.m.) when I took a Meloxicam (15 mg) which my GP prescribed for achiness in my neck due to arthritis. I take this drug only when needed and thought it would help the aching in my legs. Maybe it did...maybe it was a coincidence that the achiness was alleviated enough for me to go to sleep. I am almost 100% today. It takes a little longer at my age to fully recover from any illness however slight. I would like to add that I am grateful to be vaccinated.

Went to bed, and woke up and her arm is swollen, it&#39;s like she has a frozen shoulder, is pounding pain, extremely tight, difficult to move, can&#39;t move it, and very constricted which prevents her from using it.   The pain goes all the way down to her elbow.  She cannot use the left hand, and when she tries to move her arm at the elbow has excruciating pain.   She took 2 Tylenol which helped, but the pain comes back when it&#39;s time for more Tylenol and is also taking Ibuprofen but the symptoms are still there.  Just to lift her arm up to put on the arms of a chair is painful with no mobility in the arm.

She went to bed and covered up under lots of covers, and just froze.  She put on extra clothes, layers of blankets and her legs felt swollen, painful.  She kept having to urinate a lot, could not sleep, was awake all night, her arm started hurting as well, could not lay on that side, and then started getting cold/hot flashes.  She felt as though her heart was racing, and her brain as well trying to figure out what was happening.  Her husband took her temperature in the morning and it was 101.9, which her normal is 97.9.  At that point she was exhausted from being up all night, and was frightening and couldn&#39;t stop trembling all night long into Saturday.  When day broke on Saturday shew as not able to get out of bed for the entire day.  She could not eat, had no appetite and drank water day.  On Sunday she felt a little better, ate breakfast and the rest of the day went okay other than being exhausted.  This morning, 3/22/21, she still feels lofty, is able to function and feels a little removed/foggy feeling.   She is still not feeling completely well, but is on her way.  Not steady on her feet yet.   She took some Bayer aspirin for the symptoms.

I was afraid, I was going to faint. My stomach was upset. I made up to the bathroom, sat on the toilet, had a bowel movement and felt like I was going to threw up, never did threw up. I got real tired from headache and I just sat there until I thought it was safe to stand, which I did. So, I was reading in my little brochure and it said what to call this number to report any side effect so I was not dizzy but I did feel like I was going to lose consciousness.&#34; The patient assessed the events as non-serious with outcome of unknown.  Reported causality for COVID Vaccine to events for stomach upset, headache was related.

                                                odd feeling; dizziness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient herself).  A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: FL3246, expiration date unknown), intramuscularly in left arm (also reported as subcutaneously in the left deltoid muscle) on 07Jan2021 at 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.

Concomitant medication included bupropion as antidepressant for about six years. Family medical history was reported none. The patient experienced dizziness  on 07Jan2021 following the first dose. The patient received the first dose on 07Jan2021 (yesterday) morning. She did not have any symptoms after the injection, but by the end of the afternoon/ late afternoon or early evening, she started feeling dizzy. She was not sure if it was because of her age. In the morning of 08Jan2021, when she woke up, she was feeling more dizzy. It was not to the point where she felt she was going to fall though. She would like to know if this has been reported as a common side effect. The patient asked when will it get better and if this will affect her second dose in 3 weeks. There was no prescriber and patient went to designated vaccine site which was not a military facility. The patient further reported that the dizziness was nothing notable last night. It was not better. In the morning of 08Jan2021, she walked around a bit and ate breakfast, thinking that would take away. When sitting, she as fine. When getting up to walk, she noticed it. The room was not spinning. It was just an odd feeling. When reading the vaccine card, she said she is looking for glasses and confirmed that she needed them prior to getting the vaccine. The patient also informed that one of the side effects of bupropion was dizziness and she did not take it on 08Jan2021. She did take the dose in the night of 07Jan2021. It was in a pharmacy vial with no lot or expiration. The patient had no previous history of previous immunizations with Pfizer vaccine. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date as the BNT162B2. The event did not require ER or physician&#39;s office. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The event  was considered non-serious by the reporter. There were no relevant tests. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

A 75-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1686), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 15:45 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Leighten Plantar Alopecia (hair follicle is an enemy), skin infection (infection in body most of the time, at least on skin), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, obesity, autoimmune disorder (diagnosed 8 months ago). She has lost some height, prior to taking the vaccine and she said it was related to age. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced feeling unwell on 10Jan2021; blood in urine on 10Jan2021 at 17:00; nausea at 10:00, chills at 11:00, almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office at 10:00, felt cold - all on 11Jan2021; getting really tired/fatigue on 14Jan2021 at 09:30; gets really sweaty on 13Jan2021 at 10:00; and dizziness on unknown date. The patient had the first shot on Friday (08Jan2021). On Sunday (10Jan2021), she started feeling bad. She was feeling good about getting it and had no reaction. She has an autoimmune disorder that made her a little afraid to take, but with all the indications, they said it would be much better for her to take it than to get the COVID virus. Sunday (10Jan2021), she does not feel good. So, she started having blood in urine. She thought she had a UTI and had not had one in 20 years. It felt like that is what she had and with the blood in urine. She just took Tylenol and waited until Monday morning because she does not like sitting in doctor&#39;s office. They gave her a cup to give sample and said she didn&#39;t need to see provider. They will have it checked and in the meantime call in a prescription. It kept getting worse and worse. She was about to passed out in the doctor&#39;s office on 11Jan2021, she got nauseous and almost threw up. She got in the car with her husband and he was trying to get her home. She got chills and got so cold and could not warm her body up. Her husband gave her Phenergan and it kind of knocked her out for a while to ease her nausea. She was thinking of going later today (14Jan2021), when she gets enough energy, to get a COVID test. She does not know if it will give false positive or not. She had chills and now she gets sweaty since 13Jan2021. She took her temperature and she did not have one. She just now got up. It is 10:00. She got up this morning (14Jan2021) and was really tired. She was not sweating this morning. Tiredness is kind of new, and when she talked to the nurse, she sort of felt like maybe it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine, but then she talked to her daughter and she said the symptoms she was having are usually symptoms that occur with second dose of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for people to have symptoms she was having. She wanted to know if she should have a COVID test. If she has had just one shot, would the test give a false positive coming from the COVID. They were asking if patient should take the second dose, and should she continue her UTI medication. Doctor&#39;s visit to give urine sample on 11Jan2021 (results: negative for UTI). She did not see a doctor though. They sent sample and prescribed a sulfa based medication for a UTI. She did start feeling a little better and stopped having blood in her urine. She plans to continue it because she does not like to stop taking an antibiotic. She did not have any clue that it was not a UTI until the nurse from her provider&#39;s office called to tell her results of urine sample was negative. Outcome of event getting really tired/fatigue was not recovered; events almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office, blood in urine, chills, and gets really sweaty was recovering; and unknown for other events.

                                                severe chills; Fever; Dizziness; not feeling quite right; heart pains; Nauseated; threw up; Tiredness; muscle aches; a little swelling in her face; weakness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

It was noted that patient has had intermittent syncope since August of 2020 and clinical interpretation is likely that pericardial effusion pre dated vaccination.  In her workup for dizziness and syncope she had not previously undergone EKG, chest x-ray or echocardiogram therefore pericardial effusion could have been missed.  I elected to report the  pericardial effusion to be on the side of caution.

The next morning was much better although still a bit tired.  It was very scary but I realized that it was a reaction to the vaccination.

                                                arthritis; fingers on right were all swollen; she could barely move her arm; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; right hand and wrist was painful and swollen; light headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient.  A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 at 10:40 (at the age of 75-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included arthritis from an unknown date, renal cancer since 07Dec2020 and ongoing, atrial fibrillation since 2006 and ongoing,  partial nephrectomy on 06 Jan2021. She specified that she has an arthritis flare up about once a year and normally takes a Medrol dose pack.  The patient&#39;s historical vaccines included an unspecified flu vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) on an unspecified date about ten years ago after which she had to go to the Emergency Room for right arm redness, swelling at the injection site and face swelling on right side. She did not get another flu shot for 10 years but did get one this year in Nov2020. Concomitant medication included metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), flecainide acetate (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN, MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reports that she experienced a light headache. She clarified that she is in an unspecified program which includes an e-diary. As part of that program (app) she was sent a text every day for a week asking if she had any side effects; a couple times she had a headache.  On the eighth day (03Feb2021) she had a reaction where her right hand and wrist was painful and swollen. Caller states she couldn&#39;t move her hand without pain. Caller states she put ice on her hand Wednesday evening and this helped a little.  When ice was on her hand it helped with the pain but when it was removed it came back. She also reported fingers on right were all swollen and that she does have arthritis.  She further described the events as on Wednesday she started getting a little pain in her right wrist joint. She does have arthritis, but this pain was stronger, and her hand and fingers on right were all swollen in comparison to her other hand, and her knuckles seemed bigger. States that the pain got very strong and by the next morning she could barely move her arm; even though it was only her wrist that hurt, moving any part of her arm made her wrist her more, so she started icing it and took Tylenol for Arthritis 650mg Extended Release; she took it twice, one each time and reported that it probably didn&#39;t work. Caller clarifies statement about it probably not working; stating that she didn&#39;t notice a difference after taking the Tylenol.  She asked if these events, occurring eight days after the vaccine could be vaccine side effects or is this just a flare up on her arthritis that is unrelated to the vaccine. She added that she had been doing a lot of &#34;chopping&#34; while cooking on the night that this happened so that may have caused the flare up. She has a Medrol pack on hand for things like this (4mg tablets). She started it today and took two tablets before breakfast and one tablet at lunch. She states that it has already made a difference in her pain. She stated her concern, however, which is that she found that taking a steroid could affect the vaccine if taken before getting the vaccine, and right now she is in-between the two doses.  Her second dose is scheduled for 16Feb2021. She inquired as to if she can finish this dose pack without messing up the vaccine. The clinical outcome of headache was reported as recovered. The clinical outcomes of  hand swelling, wrist pain, hand pain and swelling of wrists were reported as not recovered. The clinical outcomes of arthritis flare up, swelling of fingers and could not move her arm were unknown.

                                                When I was outside leaving the facility, I noticed a tight knot in my chest.Less than a half an hour later,I had pulled over in the park and was trying to fix myself. Soon I realized breathing was not helping. It didn&#39;t seem to work. Exercise did not help. I started getting worse. I had difficulty getting back to my car I was fatigued my vision was getting blurry.My thinking was not sure. I couldn&#39;t figure out how to get my seat down in my car. Finally I got it down enough so I could recline. Then I decided to try to use my I watch pull up my Hart app.I measured over 155 bpm. I noticed that I was feeling better as my heart rate decreased to 141 bpm. I decided to drive home and left my car seat reclined. When I got h I stayed laying down in my bed for two hours because when I tried to get up I was way too dizzy. I&#39;ve been unable to reach my primary care doctor when I got home.  I left a voice messages. I called my sisters to tell them what was wrong and while on the phone St. Luke&#39;s was trying to call me and then my sister said she had to hang up because St. Luke&#39;s was trying to call her.  I got up when I heard a knock on the door. It was the police. St. Luke&#39;s had called the police.  My heart rate was normal before I got up Almost 3 hours after my shot.  I spent the rest of the day and the next morning trying to find out what happened to me. I have spent days trying to get warnings about what to look out for.  Finally I found this on your website as well as the handout I should&#39;ve had before the vaccine because I would&#39;ve known what was happening to me and what to do.

                                                The day after my 2nd vaccine, I experienced significant unsteadiness in walking. It was as if I was &#39;drunk&#39;. I couldn&#39;t walk a straight line and had to hold onto something to move from point A to point B . This lasted for about 5 days and was most severe when I had to get up in the night. Very scary situation. I didn&#39;t know if I was having a stroke or...? Because I was being treated by a pain specialty group and was taking Gabapentin (for about 3 months...with no side effects, I thought that might be the problem so  with their guidance, I slowly reduced the dosage - without significant impact.

                                                I have been having dizzy spells off and on, mostly on, since receiving this vaccine. Talked to my doctor about this and he said that he found it specious that these dizzy spells started right after receiving the vaccine.  In my opinion these dizzy spells should be gone by now,  March 24, yet they seem to be getting worst . The handout shows that dizziness could be a sign of an allergic reaction, so that is why I am reporting this.  My doctor said I should get the second shot, and I will, but I really don&#39;t feel very comfortable about getting it.
