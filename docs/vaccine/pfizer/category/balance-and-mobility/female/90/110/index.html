Did deep breathing, watched and wondered when I should get help. Realized I could help myself and began using acupuncture and applied kinesiology points. After a time, breathing slowly retuned to normal.  Very, very tired.Next 2 days, balance poor. Actually fell before I realized how woozy I was. Hit head on wall, but not knocked out. After balance recovered, still very tired after 10 days, but not as bad. Memory worse.  Hoping all will improve.

She was in and out of ER for 3 days, when we finally took her home and got hospice care. On January 19, 2021 Dr&#39;s office told us that she could get the 2nd vaccine the next day.

She died on January 29, 2021.

A 91-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248; expiration date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and blood thinner. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner. The patient is asking if there were any reports of adverse events with kidneys and the vaccine. She received the 1st shot last Thursday (07Jan2021) and told that yesterday (10Jan2021), she had an episode where kidneys weren&#39;t acting. She also mentioned that she is on a blood thinner, ELIQUIS. She is due to receive the 2nd shot on 28Jan2021. She said that she wouldn&#39;t want to receive the 2nd dose if this was related to her adverse reaction. The issue with the kidney started after on 10Jan2021, yesterday she was really having problems, she went to church then came home by that time she would have to go to the bathroom, but she did not go, she ended up cooking dinner which was 3 hours later, she was noticing that she was not urinating. She drank some Gatorade and that made it little better, she is wondering if it&#39;s a side effect. On 10Jan2021, when she noticed the kidney issues, she did not know for certain if it started before that, she didn&#39;t pay attention. Also, yesterday (10Jan2021), she got sick in which she had to grab the counter, she felt bad, she wasn&#39;t dizzy, but felt light-headed. The symptom of not having the feeling to urinate had improved a little today but she is concerned and wanted to know if this was a side effect. Her being light-headed only occurred on 10Jan2021, it was a onetime occurrence yesterday. However, she was also just sitting around, laying around, after that yesterday. The outcome of the event &#39;light-headed&#39; was unknown; while outcome of other events was recovering.

This went on  for 4 days (until 1/31/2021).  She called a nurse at her facility morning of 1/31/2021, who told her it was most likely a side effect from the vaccine.   My mom did not feel reassured and called the front desk at her facility.   Eventually 911 was called, the paramedics came afternoon of 1/31/2021 and they told her her blood pressure was not quite right, and if she wanted to go to the hospital.  She said no.   She was less upset though.   She still didn&#39;t feel &#34;normal&#34; until 2/2/2021.  She is prone to panic and PTSD if things don&#39;t feel right.

A 91-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: unknown, NDC number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Feb2021 15:30 (at the age of 91-year-old) as single dose To protect from Covid virus. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination; Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity) was none. Illness/AE: None. Pertinent Details (include surgical procedures and dates): N/A. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s): None. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient experienced Dizziness, Lightheadedness, broke out in a rash; very itchy rash, blisters on both arms, from elbows to hands, upper forearm, face and neck, red and blotchy on both arms, forearms to fingers, arms were so inflamed and itchy. The patient received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and developed a rash on both arms 6 days post vaccination. The reporter had noticed on day 8 (09Feb2021) a huge blister on her arm. She also felt light headed. The reporter thinks these side effects were related to the vaccine and wanted to know if they are reported with the vaccine. She also wanted to know whether the patient could get the second dose of the vaccine. It was reported that seems to be having a reaction to the first Pfizer Covid-19 shot. A couple days later, she had dizziness and lightheadedness and then days after, Day 6 (07Feb2021), that broke out in a rash. Yesterday, day 8 (09Feb2021), she had blisters on the arm and there is no other reason for her to have them, it wasn&#39;t like she did anything. Blisters are on both arms from elbows to hands. Had a little bit on the face and neck, none on her trunk, just on the upper forearm and hands. Is there anyone who has reported this reaction. Still had the rash and blisters, they had not changed. It was a very itchy rash, kind of red and blotchy on both arms, forearms to fingers. Had nothing where the injection was, it was just from the elbow down. Did go to the doctor yesterday (09Feb2021), for the rash and blisters and they had no idea what it was. Her arms were so inflamed and itchy they gave Methylprednisolone tablets to help. The patient did not visit Emergency Room, but visited Physician Office for dizziness, lightheadedness, rash, very itchy rash, blisters on both arms, from elbows to hands, upper, forearm, face and neck, red and blotchy on both arms, forearms to fingers, arms were so inflamed and itchy. No Investigation Assessment. No Relevant Tests. Outcome of the event felt lightheaded/dizziness was recovering and all other events were not recovered.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

A 92-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration administered in Arm on 04Feb2021 at 12:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN5318) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes, arthritis and thyroid, all three for 10 plus years; and bladder. Concomitant medication included ongoing methotrexate and meloxicam taken for arthritis; metformin taken for diabetes; mirabegron taken for bladder; and levothyroxine taken for thyroid, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received the vaccine on 04Feb2021 (reported as last Thursday afternoon) and everyday since then her health has declined each day. She has more fatigue every day and lightheaded. Her immune system began to shut down (several blood draws taken). She just wanted little afternoon nap. On Saturday, she wanted to do very little &#39;aero&#39; (word not clear), very little just the minimum. She get up, she had a little breakfast, and as I live near a little pond, she watched the water and birds. And then yesterday, she slept probably five hours during the day and today that is all she has done, she got up and she does not want to eat, she took a nap, she changed chairs and she took a nap. She is now in her bedroom and taking another nap and this is not my mother. The patient was still alive but in failing health since the vaccine. The patient is now bedridden, lost 20 pounds (lbs) and was in constant pain. The patient was fine, walking and even dancing prior to vaccine.  The outcome of the events &#34;Her health has declined each day&#34; was not recovered while unknown for the other events. The patient died from vaccine on 15Mar2021. The autopsy was not done.  Follow-Up (02Apr2021): Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Failing health since vaccine

                                                felling dizziness; nausea; not feeling strong; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 93-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), at left arm on unspecified date in Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization and lubiprostone (AMITIZA) , via an unspecified route of administration from Dec2020 to an unspecified date at 1 DF, 2x/day as laxative..Medical history included:TIA started in Dec2020, bowel problem, fell (she fell about 3 weeks before she got the Pfizer COVID-19 shot) and some memory loss ( not serious).She wanted to know if she should receive her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine if she was presenting the following side effects: felling dizziness, nausea and not feeling strong. She was currently taking Amitiza as a laxative. She believed these side effects were not related to the administration of the first dose of the vaccine and were rather common conditions for her age , she also stated that she did not have any &#34;negative feelings&#34; with the first shot of the vaccine.   Consumer said she had an appointment today for her second shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and got a letter yesterday that said she could get it at 03:00PM today at the center where she got the first vaccination. She said that they gave the shot in her left arm for her first vaccination. She said it was very common at this age that she very often didn&#39;t feel well, and she was on a new laxative that might be causing some upset. She said she had no fever, she was not nauseated, she had no headache, there was nothing wrong. However the outcome of the events was unknown. Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events dizziness, nausea and asthenia cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. Further details about the patient&#39;s medical history, concomitant conditions and the events would be helpful. The contributory role of the concomitant laxative also cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Injection site became pink, 3X5 inches, the day following the shot.  On 2.11.2021, about 55 hours after vaccination #2, pt developed generalized weakness, nausea, and then vomited.  She was taken to bed, where she rested poorly and only dozed off for 1-2 minutes at a time and was mumbling words.  She  continued with generalized weakness, nausea with dry heaves, a sensation of marked shortness of breath, and inability to stand without support.  Complained of feeling hot and then cold.  Appeared pale and lethargic, skin clammy and complained of difficulty breathing and was irritable. Lung sounds -clear, no wheezing despite being unable to speak more than a few words at time. Vitals at 10:00pm:  HR 62, pulse weak, O2 sat 92% (normal for her), temp 101.7F (her normal temp is 95-96).  Given a Tylenol extra strength 500mg, 2.5 mg Prednisone, increased O2 nasal canula to 3-4 L/min, and cold compresses to reduce fever and discomfort.   Vitals at 10:15p:  HR 93, O2 sat 92%, BP 131/59. Discussed going to the ER, but decided to wait until the morning if not better. Symptoms continued until ~ 2am, when she was able to fall deep asleep for 4 hours.  Awoke and felt better, able to walk, but still a bit weak and short of breath.  By noon Feb 12 she felt mostly back to normal.

                                                My mother died on February 19, 2021. She had her 2nd dose vaccine on 2/11, on 2/12 it was noted that she was not able to walk, on 2/13 she was walking at 30%, on 2/14 she was walking with difficulty, on Monday 2/15 she was throwing up violently and her blood pressure dropped, so she was sent to Clinic. My sister was told she was just constipated and she had A Fib (never reported before to us). My sister was then told on 2/16 early a.m. that she had a blood clot that destroyed her colon. Due to age surgery would likely not be successful. She then died on the Friday. We are reporting in the event that the Pfizer vaccine was somehow a contributing factor to the A fib or to the Clot. She has no history of A fib or clotting prior to this incident. She was 93, and did have dementia, but was able to eat normal foods prior to this. What was unusual was the challenge in walking the day after the shot. Other than that no difference was observed until the day she was admitted to the hospital emergency room. She was a resident at Assisted Living, Memory Care, and that is where she received the vaccine. The mailing address I provided is her mailing address prior to death.

The dizziness would stay as long as she stands up, but if she sat down, she was fine. They did not think much of it and did not really but anything together. She was calling to try and get some help/advice on what to do. They have tried motion sickness pills and called the doctor and has seen the doctor 2-3 times. She cannot think of anything else to do in order to help. She was hoping we would be able to provide some advice and say something that they should do in order to help. The patient&#39;s blood was draw, but did not find anything else going on. The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                94 yo F presented from assist living with slur speech for 1 day, last seen well on 1/30. Pt has a PMH of dementia (Baseline, she will keep saying, &#34;help me, help me&#34;, AOX3, using walker, could go to bathroom by herself), hx breast cancer (s/p lumpectomy, chemo, Tamoxifen, currently not on tx), HTN, HLD, vaginal bleeding (no further work up by family), overactive bladder (on solifenacin), hx of MI (undocumented, no PCI or CABG), spine stimulator placed. According to patient&#39;s daughter, she saw her January 30, she was doing okay after the vaccine. On  1/31 when the daughter called her on the phone, she knows she has some slurred speech, when she saw patient in the facility, she noticed her gait becomes unsteady.  She decided to bring her to the hospital.  1/30, she noticed the patient has spilled up some water, otherwise denies fever, chills, shortness of breath, pain,  chronically, she has constipations taking laxative.  In the ED, pt was afebrile, 36.1, heart rate 85, blood pressure 130/61, respiratory rate 18, saturations 98 on room air.  Labs shows, sodium 134, potassium 3.6, bicarb 28, BUN 18, creatinine 0.97, glucose 119, WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 11.8, platelet 239.  PT INR 1.09, COVID negative. CT head suggestive of subacute infarct. Possible including small vessel ischemic changes. Chest xray questionable patchy left retrocardiac atelectasis or pneumonia. EKG shows atrial fibrillation&#39;s heart rate 71, QTc 610.  Case was discussed with neurology in the ED, patient was not a TPA or embolectomy candidate. CT head suggestive of acute/subacute cerebellar infarct.  Patient does not have any residual or sensory deficit except expressive aphasia. Neuro saw patient,  mentioned patient appears to have had a stroke that by the CAT scan criteria is already subacute.  The patient was admitted on the stroke pathway.   The patient has new onset atrial fibrillation and therefore should be considered for anticoagulation.  The patient cannot have an MRI of the brain due to her spinal cord stimulator but given that the stroke is already subacute on the CT without any signs of hemorrhagic conversion she could be started on this at this point.  If she gets started on anticoagulation the aspirin should be stopped. If the patient cannot go on anticoagulation or does not want to then she might be a candidate for dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention. 2D echo shows normal ejection fraction of the left ventricle estimated at 70 to 75%.  Regional wall motion abnormality was not observed.  Right ventricle systolic function is normal.  Moderate aortic stenosis. Cardio was consulted for anticoagulation,  From cardioembolic prevention standpoint, anticoagulation is recommended to prevent CVA. However, she has significant risks for bleeding given recent vaginal bleeding (investigation not pursued to spare her comfort), age, comorbidities, etc. Again, further discussion between family and primary team is required regarding risks vs benefits. Was evaluated by speech-language pathology present minimal oral dysphagia no overt clinical signs of aspiration, recommended to continue with NDD 2 diet/thin liquid. Patient was discharged to ECF.

                                                had a fall; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse who reported for her grandmother. A 94-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020, at the age of 94 years, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included patient was admitted for a broken hip on 19Nov2020, and was then transferred to another institution on 24Nov2020; and patient does have a diagnosis of dementia. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. The reporter is a Pfizer Employee calling in regards to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was calling in regards to her grandmother who is in an inpatient rehabilitation facility. On the 16Jan2021, the patient had a fall in the rehab facility and was admitted into the hospital as a part of the facility&#39;s fall protocol. The patient was on Lovenox. The patient was admitted into the hospital on 16Jan2021 and was evaluated and discharged on 18Jan2021. At that point on 18Jan2021, Lovenox was stopped. The event was reported as serious per hospitalization. The facility has also been testing residents weekly. The patient was tested negative in the hospital when she had the broken hip and also negative when she went into the hospital for the call. The outcome of the event was recovered on 18Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information on lot/batch cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported fall likely represents an intercurrent medical condition in this 94-year-old female, and is considered unrelated to BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

A 95-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 10:15 at SINGLE DOSE in left arm for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) with lot number: EL3249 on 20Jan2021 in right arm. After receiving the 2nd dose on 10Feb2021, the patient became ill on 11Feb2021, while sitting on the toilet, she became nauseous and vomiting repeatedly even dry heaves also then became dizzy and felt a tingling in my face and right hand didn&#39;t feel like the patient could get up on her own so the patient&#39;s son and daughter assisted her to her bed. She didn&#39;t know what was wrong and her daughter thought it was a side effect of the vaccine and called the nurse on call. After arriving at the emergency and was examined the patient was told she was being kept for observation since she had just had the vaccine. The patient was later told she also had a mild heart attack and to her knowledge I never had any heart issues. She could then no longer use her walker to walk because she couldn&#39;t bear weight on her right hand. She was hospitalized for 8 days and transferred to rehab and I&#39;m still in rehab. The events were assessed as serious (hospitalized and disability). The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient received treatment for the events.

A 95-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 02Mar2021. The patient was reported to have possible side effects that was getting worse. The patient had &#34;chills, fever, nasal congestion, upper respiratory difficulty breathing, non-productive cough.&#34; On Monday evening, 29Mar2021, the patient was brought to the hospital but tests showed that &#34;everything looked good&#34; (chest x-ray etc.) Last night, the patient&#39;s temperature reached 104 F and was given paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient mentioned that she was &#34;breathing rapid,&#34; and that she &#34;coughs when she takes a breath.&#34; Reporter asked if patient can be given an antihistamine; or something to help with the upper respiratory concern (nose blockage, upper respiratory breathing). The patient had not been well. They spent Monday evening and all night and in the morning at the hospital. They did X-rays and lab work and everything else. The doctors couldn&#39;t find anything wrong with her and stated that it&#39;s got to be the vaccine. She was really in bad shape at this point. She can&#39;t be out of bed for 2 seconds without having to get back into bed. She was having a upper respiratory thing going on. She had a fever as high as 104.5 last night. The fever was last night and she got paracetamol (TYLENOL) for that and brought it down. It did respond. The patient stated she can&#39;t breathe through her nose and she has upper respiratory problems. The problem was when they went to the hospital, they didn&#39;t find signs of infections, all normal across the board. The patient doesn&#39;t fake it, she was a feisty elderly lady. She walks up the hill every day. She was independent. Normally, she can walk and walks very well without any assistance. The patient now can barely walk. She can barely walk to the toilet without holding on to anything. She was constantly complaining about chills. Reporter wanted to know what can they do and not do and what should the doctors be looking at. They kind of just threw up their hands as this was side effects of the vaccine, but the patient was alarming on Monday night and even more alarming right now. The patient was in bad shape. She wasn&#39;t feeling good on Saturday night, but not too bad on Friday night. Reporter asked her mom how she felt on Friday. Reporter told her mom to put in her hearing aids, that would probably help. Reporter further explained that patient had a sore arm around the injection site and that she might not have been feeling that great. On Saturday, she was not feeling well and started to have a fever, sinus infection and upper respiratory problems. The patient stated that she finally identified it. Reporter confirmed the fever, sinus infection, and upper respiratory problems started on 27Mar2021 towards the late afternoon she was  progressively getting worse. Fever, sinus infection, chills, upper respiratory problems all have worsened. The reporter stated that her mother&#39;s (patient&#39;s) arm pain got better on Sunday and was now gone. On Saturday, her arm hurt from her shoulder to her elbow, it did get worse. However, a the next day it was gone pretty much. Monday in the emergency room, they did labs for her kidney, liver and were looking for infection. They did not find anything came up normal on everything. Today, the reporter thinks patient was worse. She doesn&#39;t want to come out of bed at all. She was laying there like a lump, whining and crying which she has never done. She was probably going to take her to the hospital again and  they were not going to do anything again. She stated that something got to change, They haven&#39;t had that conversation about going to the hospital. She was going to go downhill if this continues, it had gone downhill at this point. Reporter confirmed that patient has recovered completely from the arm pain while outcome of remaining events was not recovered.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On May 14, 2021, at 9:30 p.m., patient was found on the floor by caretakers who had her taken to the Emergency Dept.  She exhibited signs of a stroke; her left side was paralyzed.  A CT scan of her brain was done, which showed a blood clot in her brain, which caused the stroke.  She was taken to medical center, where she remains as of today, June 3, 2021.  She remains paralyzed on her left side so she is unable to walk, or to use her left arm, or to swallow without aspirating food into her lungs.  Potentially we have found a care facility and hope that she will be moved there within a few days.     Of all the people I know, patient is the last person I would expect to have a stroke.   She has always had good blood, a strong heart, strong bones, has never smoked or drank, has never been overweight, and has always worked hard and exercised daily.   Her internal organs are all strong and well-functioning.  She has had two CT scans of her brain within the last couple of years, the last one near the end of 2020, and they were both clear.  These scans were done following falls which she took.  She had the the COVID-19 on January 23 and February 17 of 2021 and had a stroke on May 14, 2021.  There is no doubt in my mind that her stroke was caused by these injections.  She will never recover from this event and will probably get pneumonia, which will bring about her death!

                                                The above info is available but it is as my mothers....She had a bad reaction ( very flu like for several days). I proceeded with second shot in February....she did not feel well, but just sorta didn&#39;t want to get up anymore. She slept more and more and more. Her appetite declined. I got her up and she was ravenous. She slept more and seemed in a lethargic way to take less and less interest. She was living independently and had been most of her life. We scheduled an internist report. She passed labs with flying colors....... when you are 96 they look at everything as remarkable ( will live for 10 more years). I also was not equating any of this with the vaccine. However, we could not ignore it any longer Saturday the 4-10-21. I took her to ER. She was lucid and walking with difficulty. I took her in by ambulance as she was just saying, &#34;I&#39;m so week!&#34; I&#39;m so whoozie! On Sunday they are talking immediate intensive rehab. Neurologist leave for 5 days and in next 48 hours she becomes 200% less. First delusional, then sleeps all day. He showed me an MRI that to a layperson looked like little hives all over the brain ( I had also gotten hives from somewhere on my skin that I originally equated with Covid but no one thought so. I have also had the two shots.) One week out I was looking at Hospic eand long term care placement. Yesterday they couldn&#39;t get a diagnosis for Hospice ( the person sent to sign her up). I thought what? After all these tests and  maybe it is cardio, maybe it is exchemic  strokes, they don&#39;t have a diagnosis because she hasn&#39;t changed much since 2017? We have to take this totally fine independent  woman and in one week say, &#34;She has Dementia?&#34; It&#39;s possible but what caused it? It&#39;s not age......we live until we are 110. Yes, that MRI showed me little formations of clotting all over ( no major bleed if any in a lobe). Over the last week I have been looking at her health and how we just slowly went downhill. It&#39;s easy to blame a vaccine, but still..........I am saying that there were NO OTHER reasons other than she didn&#39;t seem to tolerate the shots well........first was acute, and the second was long term and slow...........

A 96-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 28Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EP6955) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Leukaemia in 2018, High blood pressure with 40 years, Diabetes in 2016, Atrial fibrillation in 2018.The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN6199) in left arm on 07Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. She had just had her blood drawn in Feb2021 and her blood was ok. So on 07Mar2021 she received her first Covid 19 vaccine. At 96 years old, after the Covid 19 vaccine, her mother&#39;s body was full blown with leukemia. Radiation wasn&#39;t an option to stop the overproducing of her white blood cells. The Covid 19 vaccine just accelerated it. Maybe there are others out there in this condition and should be double checking to see if they should get the Covid 19 vaccine.  On the 12Apr2021 or 13Apr2021 her mother started having a hollow cough. She wasn&#39;t congested but she continued to cough. She noticed her mother was breathing heavy and fighting to breathe on Friday, on16Apr2021. It wasn&#39;t getting any better and she thought her mother would have more trouble so she took her to the emergency room. She reported she took her mother to the hospital on 16Apr2021.She was admitted on 16Apr2021 and discharged on 18Apr2021. They gave her some oxygen and did some tests. They asked her mother if she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and she did not, they suggested that it was her atrial fibrillation. She has had atrial fibrillation in the past, her doctor did leave her on her atrial fibrillation medication. She can&#39;t recall the name of the atrial fibrillation medication. She was discharged home on 18Apr2021 and she was breathing ok on her own. But by that next Tuesday, 20Apr2021, she noticed her mother was declining. She wasn&#39;t acting like herself. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, she was more tired and her difficulty breathing started back up. On Thursday, 22Apr2021, she called the ambulance to take her mother to the hospital. She could tell that her mother wasn&#39;t herself, she could hardly talk on 22Apr2021 , she couldn&#39;t stand up, she lost control of her bowels. She wasn&#39;t responding to her. The caller knew something was going on. They put oxygen on her mother and they transferred her to a cancer specialist hospital. That&#39;s when the doctor realized it was a leukoblast. Clarified with caller, leukoblast. Then her mother died. She died on 28Apr2021.The caller knows the hospital was doing tests to see what was causing her mother&#39;s pain, but she doesn&#39;t have that information. She heard the screams from her mother and there was no consoling her mother. The hospital gave her mother morphine and it didn&#39;t work. She has no product information for the morphine, it was given in the hospital. She was screaming for murder, screaming for help and was given the morphine. Within a month of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine her leukemia was back and her mother was screaming in agony and pain because her sides were blowing up in pain. Whatever the Covid 19 vaccine did in her body, her body thought it was fighting off something. She had no red blood cells that could provide oxygen to her organs. She was weak. Overproducing of her white blood cells on an unspecified date. The lab data included White blood cell count abnormal and Red blood cell count decreased. Outcome of her mother&#39;s body was full blown with leukemia/she wasn&#39;t responding was fatal, of remaining events was unknown. Treatment received for all events. The seriousness of event breathing heavy and fighting to breathe were reported as hospitalization from 16Apr2021 to 18Apr2021. The seriousness criteria of she wasn&#39;t responding was reported as hospitalization from 22Apr2021 to 28Apr2021.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Fatal Neoplasm progression
