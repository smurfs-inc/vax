                                                Fever, chills, extreme fatigue, lightheadedness and very sore arm, but more importantly chest tightness that became increasingly worse over 48 hours. My daughter dealt with the other symptoms but her asthma became less treatable over the two days since the second shot. I finally administered the nebulizer and inhaled steroid today after all other treatments failed to relieve her symptoms. She is doing better but I will follow up with the pediatrician.

I was alerted by the pharmacy technician I was needed outside of the immunization room and patient had vomited. It seemed to be mostly stomach acid (no food particles) and was roughly 12oz or less of fluid (hard to tell since it was contained in a plastic bag. Patient sipped on some water, which she tolerated well. She stated she suddenly felt really dizzy and then felt the need to throw up. After the water, she felt better and was looking to see if eating something would help settle her stomach. She did not appear pale or diaphoretic. I encouraged her to stay longer for continued observation by she left before 15 minutes were up after the vomiting. She was in the pharmacy observation area for about 20 minutes total. She smiled and waved as she left.

                                                Patient is a 16yo seen for her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. She was seated in the back seat of the car. Shortly after receiving her vaccine (within a few minutes), she chose to move to the front passenger seat of the car, and after sitting in the passenger seat she became lightheaded and lost consciousness. Syncopal event was witnessed and lasted a few seconds. She spontaneously regained consciousness, and complained of some lightheadedness and tunnel vision. No significant confusion was noted, her responses to questions were appropriate. Initial pulse was thready and heart rate initially difficult to auscultate. Pale color noted on the face. Initial pulse approximately 50bpm. Breath sounds clear with good air exchange. Patient was placed in a reclined position with feet on the dash.  She quickly recovered and repeat heart rate was auscultated at approximately 70bpm, stronger pulse noted. She was noted to have improvement and she was then driven out of the vaccine site after obtaining consent from her mother (who was the driver) and parked beside EMS. BP was 100/50 and HR 68-72, SaO2 97%.  Lightheadedness resolved and she was feeling well, at her baseline.  She was monitored for 30 min then allowed to leave with her mother, she was at her baseline at last evaluation. Per history review with her mother, she has had 2 prior episodes of syncope with pin removal from hand after surgery and IV placement.

We brought her into the clinic room and sat her down. Never had trouble swallowing and did not have any swelling. Felt hot and bit sweaty and light headed. Reports has felt similar ways in past when had blood drawn. We laid her down and she immediately started feeling better. Mom and sister were with her. Refused ambulance or transfer to physician.

She did not hit her head because I was able to help her on her way down - it was a ver small room with 3 people in it. The pharmacist was there and he said it was a seizure, she just jerked her chin up, sharply 3 or 4 times. She laid on the ground for about five minutes, then sat on the ground, then sat in a chair for a total of about 20 minutes. She felt dizzy and nauseated for about 15 minutes after. She drank a juice and felt better so we drove home, no other symptoms since.

                                                I got the shot at around 4 in the afternoon and after sitting in the waiting area for around 15 minutes I was allowed to leave. When I left I only had a slight headache, but nothing that seemed very noticeable. I felt a tad woozy but it was nothing serious so I went on with my day and went to my sports practice for an hour and a half. After I got home and had eaten, I was working and started to feel the effects. It started with an increasingly worse headache at around 9 and as the night went on it got worse and I constantly needed to lie down. My arm had started to feel sore but it was nothing much. I thought I could sleep it off but woke up feeling horrible. My stomach could not hold any food down and my headache had become really bad. I had to go to my sports game but on the car ride over (around 45 min) I got very nauseous. Throughout the course of the day my headache would get worse any time I tried to run and all I wanted to do was lie down and sleep. I was barely able to stand, let alone run and I felt sleepy all day. My arm had also gotten very sore and any contact on it made me flinch back. I was not able to eat or drink anything until about 4  in the afternoon and my stomach was not sitting right the entire time and I constantly was burping and feeling like I was going to vomit despite having only water in my stomach. After I was able to eat the stomach ache went away a bit but the headache lasted through the night and has finally started to subside two days later.

As she was walking to the teacher&#39;s desk, she lost consciousness and fainted, hitting her head on a desk, scraping her neck on a desk, and suffering several other minor injuries from the fall.  She was immediately seen by school nurse and released to my care for the rest of the day. She rested at home and then was seen in at Walk-In Clinic to be evaluated for a concussion.  On Day 2 after receiving the vaccine, the patient reported a sore throat, but no other symptoms.  She was seen on the third day post-vaccine by our pediatrician&#39;s office for possible strep.  She tested negative for strep and a concussion from her fainting episode was confirmed due to the lingering headache.

She was vaccinated and then left the immunization room to sit down for a 15 minute waiting period.  When she went to sit down, she collapsed on the floor.  Her mother assisted her into a chair.  She continued to be incoherent and have her eyes rolling back into her head for a few minutes.  We used a cool cloth on her forehead and the back of her neck.  The parents requested that we call 911.  EMS arrived shortly and evaluated her.  Heart rate, blood pressure, pulse ox, blood sugar and chest sounds were all within normal range.  The patient stated that her arm felt heavy and &#34;funny&#34;.  She then stated that her tongue felt funny.  EMS evaluated her tongue and said it looked normal.  To err on the side of caution, she was taken to the hospital to determine whether or not she was having a delayed onset anaphylactic reaction.  This patient has no history of seizures.

She remained seated in the room and closed her eyes a couple times but never appeared to lose consciousness.  Her dad joined us in the room and confirmed she was really nervous before the vaccine.  We kept her seated for several minutes and then she said she felt sick and vomited.  After that she started to regain her color and was able to move to the waiting room.  She sat there for about 5 more minutes and then felt well enough to leave with her dad.

PT reported feeling anxiety before vaccination, but indicated that she was ready for her vaccination. Immediately post-vaccination, PT experienced an apparent vasovagal response, presenting with palor, slumped posture. PT&#39;s eyes were open, but PT was unresponsive and later reported no memory of events. PT became responsive within 2 minutes, but remained &#34;shakey&#34; and pale. RN was in attendance and provided initial assessment/response. RN also responded to PT. Aid was called at 1251 and EMTs arrived at 1253. Aid assessed PT, took vital signs (1256: BP 104/56 laying, HR 70, SPO2 98% on room air, 1303 BP 110/62 laying, HR 87, SPO2 99% RA, 1307: BP 96/58 sitting, SPO2 99%RA, 1311: BP 106/62 sitting, SPO2 99% RA).  Treatment: PT was assisted to lay down on cot, water and juice were provided and consumed, cool compress were provided. Psychosocial support provided. Education to PT and mother to monitor for further s/s and to seek out urgent care if more were noted.  Outcome: PT&#39;s color improved soon after laying down, PT reported &#34;feeling better&#34; after consuming juice and water. PT sat at edge of cot without difficulty, walked down hallway without difficulty. PT medically cleared by EMS at 1223, exited facility with mother in private vehicle.

                                                Patient passed out within a minute of vaccination. Mother and I moved patient to a laying down position where she immediately woke up and knew where she was and what just happened. Declined any other symptoms. Mom said she passes out often after vaccinations. Patient was conscious carrying on a conversation like normal immediately after coming to. Over the next 30 minutes I tried to get patient to a sitting position to take her blood pressure but every time we tried she needed to lay back down because she felt like she was going to pass out. After trying this twice and being unsuccessful I had EMS called to check on patient to make sure nothing more serious going on. EMS came and took a couple blood pressures and pulses which were normal. Patient was starting to feel better. Walked out with EMS and planned on going home.

She was tested for active COVID-29 infection via nasal swab PCR and tested positive. Upon presentation labs were drawn and her platelet count was found to be 8 on 5/15. Repeat labs were drawn that day to confirm low platelet count and confirmed diagnosis and thrombocytopenia secondary to an immune reaction to the vaccine was suspected. She was admitted and was started on tranexamic acid, medroxyprogesterone, dexamethasone and IV immunoglobulin (Ig) to help treat low platelet count and vaginal bleeding. As of writing, she is still admitted and her most recent platelet count on 5/17 was 16.

                                                is a 16-year-old female patient admitted with tachycardia.  Starting 1-1/2 weeks ago, mom notes that she has had episodes where she feels her heart racing.  It began 1-1/2 weeks ago with her crying and her watch that her heart rate was 208.  They went to the ED, where she was given some fluids and her heart rate improved so she was sent home.  She had had prior episodes of mild tachycardia up to the 140s in the past but which has always improved with fluids.  Mom states that she used to have a lot of trouble maintaining her hydration and would not drink a lot of water.  Since the last 1-1/2 weeks, she has been having these episodes 1-2 times a day that last about 1 to 2 minutes with a max of 5 minutes.  When it comes on, she feels dizzy and lightheaded, and after the episode she feels a big rush of blood to her head.  She also has some associated shortness of breath.  She denies having any episodes of chest pain at all.  She has never passed out, she has never felt like she was going to pass out, she has never felt like she was out of balance.  She denies any nausea or vomiting during episodes.  She denies any headaches during the episodes.  She does have history of migraines, but has not had one in the last couple weeks.  Her prior resting heart rate was in the 80s per her watch, and lately it has been in the 110s to 120s while awake in 80s while asleep.  Along with the episodes, she also feels some pulsating sensation in her abdomen.  She does not have any abdominal pain.  Today, her heart rate was again in the 200s, but it was worse than before because it lasted about 30 minutes total.  Lately they have been using an app that continuously monitors her heart rate.  Since these episodes started, she has cut down on her caffeine intake and she has increased her water intake.  Does not feel that this helped. She has never had syncope in the past and has never had seizures in the past.  Patient was started on carvedilol which has helped control heart rate and was encouraged to drink fluids. Per primary care team, her current episode of tachycardia was not due to the vaccine.

                                                Patient started experiencing numbness and tingling on her right side and then all over on Sunday evening 5/2/21. It affected her gait and the numbness and tingling in her legs caused her to have to catch herself and hold on to something to keep from falling. She described that her legs felt weak for a few seconds when walking. This sensation gradually decreased in intensity and duration. When I saw her at 5 pm on 5/3, she had normal gait and only felt the numbness and tingling very briefly. Her exam including her neuro exam was normal on 5/3 when I saw her.  The sensation of numbness and tingling completely resolved by 5/4.  She also experienced HA, nausea and fatigue, but did not have syncope, dizziness or fevers.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I woke up at about 4:30 AM and couldn?t fall back asleep, I kept feeling sleepy until I would get jolted back awake over and over. My joints were hurting, I had somewhat severe nausea, my head started throbbing. At about 6:40 AM my migraine started, my arm felt hot to the touch, and I got dizzy so I took some acetaminophen. At 10:00 PM I noticed the area under my left armpit was a little swollen and really sore, my throat and right tonsil was also sore and it hurt to swallow. The next day (today) I have another migraine, my throat and left armpit are still sore,  and my muscles hurt. I?m getting better though.

Patient is a 16 yo girl, admitted on 4/19 with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (4/19) after presenting with progressive new onset chest pain. She was in usual state of health up until 2 days ago when she started developing body aches, and chest pain. Patient received her 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine last week (4/15). No known history of COVID infection. Parents brought her to the ED yesterday after she complained of dizziness, SOB, chest pain, and had a near syncopal event. EKG showed non-specific ST abnormalities with labs showing elevated troponin, mildly elevated CRP, normal CXR, negative COVID PCR. Denies fever, GI symptoms, GU symptoms, headache, rash. Once transferred to our PICU, she was worked up for myocarditis vs MIS-C. Troponin has been trended q6 and is trending up (now 11). Of note, there have been no fevers. Patient is a 16 yo girl, s/p admission (4/19-4/23/21) with myocarditis, s/p IVIG (4/19), has now been readmitted on 5/10 with myocarditis after presenting with headache and neck pain for 2 days. Following discharge from the PICU on 4/23, patient states that symptoms have lingered (low grade fevers, feeling tired, on and off chest pain). After developing a progressive headache and neck pain, she came back to the ER for re-evaluation. Upon readmission, her troponin was elevated (2.06 on 5/10). Her CBC and CMP were reassuring. Blood culture collected on 5/11 and urine culture collected on 5/10. ID consulted for workup.

I went to check on her and she appeared pale and seemed very drowsy and unresponsive to questions. She continued to complain about dizziness and nausea. Her parents grabbed some water for her and still there was no improvement. I called 911 to report the symptoms and was advised to administer EpiPen. When asked if her breathing improved, she nodded yes, but she did not appear to have improved. She continued to be unresponsive to questions and appeared extremely drowsy. Within 15 minutes, the ambulance arrived.

I took my blood pressure and the reading was 120/71 with a pulse of 54 which is really low. I went to the Dr. to be evaluated. Dr. felt it was a vasovagal response. I will continue to monitor myself and if it continues, I will see a cardiologist.

                                                passed out; BP was 70/44; could not sit or stand; EKG-Potential abnormal Twave; Calcium was low; This is a spontaneous report received from two contactable consumers reporting for her daughter. A 16-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), vaccinated at the age of 16 years old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Deltoid Left on 05May2021 15:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8735; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient received the first dose on unknown date. Her daughter had no reaction from the first one that was three weeks prior.  The patient medical history included Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Concomitant medications included lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE) taken for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, start and stop date were not reported. Last Wednesday, at 3 pm, caller&#39;s daughter received the second vaccine.  Her daughter had no ill effects.  Her daughter got up the next morning, 18 hours after administration, and passed out. Caller states that they called the squad and her daughter&#39;s BP was 70/44.  They pushed an IV, transported her daughter, and they were in the ER for 10 hours. The local hospital gave her daughter 2 1/2 bags of fluid and transported her daughter to Hospital. Caller adds that there were 4 liters of fluid given, and her daughter could not sit or stand without her blood pressure dropping for about 8 hours after the incident. There were 2 transports and 2 ER&#39;s. Caller asks why were they not told that this is a symptom.  She was grateful that she could catch her daughter before she hit her head, but what about parents who leave their kids alone. Last Wednesday, caller&#39;s daughter received the vaccine 05May2021 at 3 pm and passed out 06May2021 in the morning.  It was the only time she passed out and caller states she saw her daughter&#39;s head drop and then was trying and caught her.  She was trying to talk to her and her eyes were in the back of her head, and was trying to arouse her.  She was out for over a minute.  She went to Emergency Room in. They were there for 6 hours.  Then, when she could not sit up and her blood pressure was dropping, they recommended Hospital.  She was there, this all took place, on Thursday from 9 am or around 8:50 am when she passed out and then they were discharged after 9 pm.  It was a 12 hour situation where they were transported and she spent 12 hours in 2 emergency rooms. The only one she had at time was vyvanse but she did not take this before passing out.  The last time that she took this would have been nine hours before administration of the vaccine on 05May2021. She did not take it on 06May2021 when the incident happened.  She was just getting up.  She had only been on this for about a week.  It is a stimulant drug but it is out of the system in the evening so people can sleep.  She asked each doctors if this had any role in it and they said no.  They told her to take it again which they have not started back yet.  She has no other medical conditions. Investigations: caller does not provide dates or specific test results.  The first ER did bloodwork, urine, chest x-ray. They wanted a CAT scan of her head but caller declined because she thought it was unnecessary. They did an EKG at first in the ER.  Nothing was abnormal.  She did have some things out of range in bloodwork which is not surprising because she was taking in fluids. Her calcium was low.  Nothing was way out of range, nothing was abnormal. The second ER did a follow up EKG but no other tests or bloodwork.  According to three physicians, the EKG was fine.  A cardiologist reviewed the 2nd EKG and she got a phone call that they wanted her to follow up because of potential abnormal T waves which could have been a result of that much fluid intake and electrolytes being out of sync after that much fluid.  They are following up on this. Her father has as vasovagal response hat he has experienced 4-5 times in his lifetime. He has never passed out following a vaccine. Caller had no idea that was even a response to vaccine. He has passed out after giving blood, with severe pain, coming out of anesthetic, and with severe stress. He has never had an extended period of time where his blood pressure was low. She, they could not get, her blood pressure up with fluid after fluid which is why she was transported to the second ER because they thought they did not know what was going on there. Caller states does she think that there may be some relationship and her daughter has this tendency to vasovagal - yes.  Was it brought on by the vaccine?  Yes.  She has never fainted in her life.  Caller adds she can see how some many say this may not be related to the vaccine but 18 hours after administration, they can not get her blood pressure up and were in the ER for 12 hours. Treatment included all the fluid, and 2 capsules of acetaminophen.  No other treatment. Outcome of events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available.

Then again Mother checked on daughter later on and daughter was unresponsive when mom was tapping her in the face-she was just looking at her mom but not seeing or hearing her -like a black out-- couldnt be woken up easily- and when she did wake she couldn&#39;t see.  But since those 2 episodes daughter&#39;s sight is back but she feels nauseous and has an upset stomach.

                                                My daughter had a mild seizure 5 minutes or less after receiving her first vaccine. She fell out of her chair, her eyes fluttered and rolled in the back of her head, her teeth were clocking and chattering and her body was shaking mildly. She lost consciousness for approximately 2 minutes. At 8:33 pm she felt a second seizure begin, her step father grabbed her before she could fall and again, her eyes fluttered and rolled in back of her head, her teeth were clicking and chattering and her whole body was shaking. The second episode lasted approximately 2 minutes as well, with her losing consciousness again. She was taken to the emergency room and stayed overnight for observation.

We called the EMTs and we advised the patient that syncope is something we have seen in children receiving the vaccine and the EMTs advised of the same thing. They took her vitals all normal and the patient began to see the symptoms disappear. The patient once better and cleared by EMTs went home per their advise.

She couldn?t see and it seemed like it was a Vaso Vagal response which resolved quickly. At 5am the woke up with a fever of 102 and extreme left arm pain. The fever was controlled with Tylenol. Two days after the vaccine she woke up complaining of chest pain and a knot under her left arm. It felt like something was pressing on her chest. We went to the ER and all tests were negative. The feeling lasted until the end of the day. Three days after the shot the next morning she got a headache  for half of the day and resolved with Tylenol. The next day all symptoms were gone.

                                                atient was in for 2nd covid-19 (Pfizer lot was EW0167, exp 8/31/2021):  It was her and her brother receiving the vaccine. Brother went first and was fine. She was second. After receiving the vaccine (~30-60sec) she appeared to lose conciseness (not sure if complete or partial) she said she didn&#39;t remember all of it, but it was more like a dream. During that she had some twitches/spams (involving circular motions with her arms and leg, leg extended and then retracted, but her head rolled back). Upon coming out/waking she appeared sensitive to light and was nauseous. Left her in the room with her mom to get an ice pack, water, paper towel. Total episode lasted less than a minute, but took about 10-15 minutes (estimate, unsure of full time spent) before she felt good enough to use a wheelchair and get in her mom&#39;s car to drive home.

By the time we sat down she said she felt like she was going to be sick.  She began sweating - it was dripping off her head and neck and her eyes kept closing.  She was extremely pale and her lips were white.  She was like this for approximately 10 minutes.

She sat more in a supine position in chair for about a minute and Mehul gave pt two ice packs - one for forehead and one for stomach - and that did not help.  So, pt lied down on floor in immunization room with ice packs on her.  She felts better after about 1 minute.  She sat up and drank cool water.  After another couple of minutes, she felt better and waited in waiting area for another 10 minutes.  After that, mom claimed pt felt fine - so they went shopping in grocery store.

                                                Patient admitted with myocarditis s/p dose #2 of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  At the time of the report, she is still hospitalized. From EHR note: Patient was in her usual state of health when she received her second dose of the Pfizer mRNA Covid vaccine on 6/3.  She experienced mild myalgias in the day following the vaccine.  However, on 6/5 she developed new severe substernal chest pain, dizziness, and dyspnea.  Pain radiated to her throat.  Given severity of pain, she presented to the emergency department.  In the ED she was afebrile, tachycardic, and initially hypertensive.  Labs demonstrated WBC 10.9 (N 49, L 27), Hb 11.7, PLT 315.  ESR 25, CRP 7.61.  Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.08, consistent with mild cardiac inflammation.  SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were negative. An EKG was normal. However, an echo demonstrated low-normal LVEF (55%).  Otherwise, patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, new rashes, arthralgias. Patient was admitted to the cardiology service for further monitoring.  Following admission, she was started on ibuprofen.  She notes that her substernal chest pain has improved somewhat since admission.  Differential for patient&#39;s presentation includes infectious, post-infectious, and non-infectious causes of myocarditis. Although post-vaccination mild myocarditis seems likely, we agree with the infectious workup already undertaken, and recommend additional EBV and CMV PCR testing.

                                                My daughter was vaccinated May 26. When her period started the following week she had a cycle unlike any she&#39;s had in the previous 3 years since she started menstruating. Her cycle was sporadic, heavier than ever and lasted longer. Simultaneously, she felt faint constantly for over 4 days, was unable to stand for more than 15 minutes, and was nauseated constantly for 5 days during her period. The ONLY thing that is different in her life this month is that she received her first dose of the vaccine. Her doc had bloodwork done and her results were perfectly normal, meaning there is no other reason to point to other than the fact that she had the 1st vaccine dose.

He is warm and well-perfused although is slightly tachycardic but appears anxious.  His reported inability to move her arms and legs does not seem consistent with a neurologic etiology of this complaint and more likely consistent with anxiety/conversion reaction in the setting of a vasovagal episode.  Will give zyrtec at mother and patient&#39;s request, PO challenge and reassess.

Approximately 5 minutes while sitting in the waiting area, patient&#39;s father noticed his daughter was about to fall over but caught her without her falling to the floor.  The patient was conscious, has a pulse and was breathing the whole time.  Pharmacist on duty called 911 and within 10 minutes the paramedic arrived.  They checked her BP, heart rate and blood sugar.  Both her BP and blood sugar were within normal range, while her heart rate was out of range. The paramedics suggested to the parents that their daughter needs further monitoring. The parents agreed and left wit the Paramedics.

Immediately upon leaving the room, she felt dizzy and made it to the chair to sit down, when she said she briefly blacked out. By that time, her father arrived, and gave her some orange juice to drink. She said she was starting to feel better, but that her stomach felt queasy. After15 minutes, the patient was feeling better and walked out with her father with no other reports of problems.

                                                Felt dizzy at work the next day after the second shot. Passed out and then was sitting down and I felt nauseous. I threw up 5 times and my arms started to get numb. I had a fever when I got home and I couldn?t move because my body hurt so badly. Migraine and dizziness has been persistent ever since and is interfering with my daily life. Been treating with tylenol which helps a little but not completely. As soon as I stand up and move I feel like I?m going to pass out.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient complained of feeling hot, flushed, and faint.  She then wanted to lie down on the floor.  I called an ambulance, as she refused to let me take her blood pressure.  When the EMTs arrived, she was sitting up and feeling notably better.  She and her mother declined going to the hospital.

                                                After only an hour outside in low 60s weather, I had felt symptoms similar to heat exhaustion. My vision got extremely spotty, and couldn?t see much. There was a loud ringing in my ears and everything else sounded muffled. I felt dizzy and my skin felt like tissue paper.  It faded after I went inside and got water. However, I still have a headache, 6 hours later.

                                                At 2am 4/22 patient started to feel sick and sent a text that I didn&#39;t read until 630 as I was asleep.  She had severe muscle aches, hurt to move, hurt to breathe and felt like she was having a heart attack.  She felt like she might pass out and had some blurred vision.  At 630am, I  saw her texts and immediately brought her 2 tylenol and a large glass of water.  She went back to bed.  She woke up around 10:45 and was feeling decent except for a headache but no fever or anything so we went to try on some Prom dresses.  At the dress shop, she collapsed and had a seizure lasting around a minute.  She lost her bladder and was completely confused and incoherent.  She&#39;s never had a seizure before.  I scooped her up, brought her to the ER where they ran every test and scan imagineable.  Full blood work up and cultures, a chest xray, a CT scan of her brain and lungs.  Her temp was high 103-104 and she had full body chills and a pounding headache.  Her BP kept dropping and got as low as 81/36.  They threw 2 bags of IV fluids into her and admitted her to the hospital.  She had also developed a heart murmur.  Over the course of the night, her BP stabilized but her temp continued to spike and come back down with Tylenol/Ibuprofen.  She also had IV Tordahl for the headache.  Her inflammatory markers were high at 15.3 which we were told should be less than 1.  They reran labs in the morning but everything can back really low which they felt was a dilution effect from all the fluids so wanted us to follow up with her primary care on Monday.  On Saturday night, he lymph nodes were swollen to the size of ping pong balls but have since slowly reduced in size although still there.  Her labs were better from discharge and her white blood cell count was within range and her inflammatory marker was down to 1.7.   Her blood sugar was a little low.  She did pass out and have seizure like response to giving blood in the doctors office,  lost bladder control again, shot pupils, etc.  She is still stuttering over words, has some short term memory retention and has some motor function issues which they think is a result of the initial seizure and should resolve itself over time.  Her liver function tests were totally normal in the hospital but are a high now so they will be checking her out again next week.

                                                Recipient is a 17yo who presented for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. She reported some anxiety related to receiving dose #2, and had some nausea after dose #1. She was alone as a driver of her own POV.  Consent was obtained from the recipient and her custodial grandparent by phone, witnessed by doctor. She initially did well after the vaccine, but after approximately 5 minutes began to complain of feeling nauseated, lightheaded, and tingling extremities (hands and feet). She was noted to be hyperventilating, and was placed in a supine position but continued to feel some lightheadedness and difficulty breathing. Breath sounds were clear without wheezing noted, HR 70s with RRR. She was noted to have ongoing anxiety, nausea and symptoms progressed and although she remained normotensive to hypertensive (initial BP 128/74), she had repeated episodes of syncope.  She was transferred to the ambulance and further vitals and EKG were obtained. She had some confusion after episodes of syncope and some seizure-like activity with syncope, with very brief episodes of LOC, with noted tachycardia with HR up to the 140s during episodes of syncope.  BP ranged 129/86 to 140/84. IV access obtained and she was given NS and started on oxygen at 2 liters, but saturations remained in the 98-99% range. She was ultimately transferred to the local ER for further evaluation and management given ongoing symptoms, evaluated at hospital.

A 17-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Apr2021 (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, panic attacks, migraines and acne. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. It was unknown if there were other vaccines in four weeks. The patient did not have Covid prior to vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. Concomitant medications in two weeks included ondansetron hydrochloride (ZOFRAN) taken for anti-nausea, start and stop date were not reported; doxycycline taken for acne, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took glycerol (GLYCERIN) and experienced allergies. The patient got her vaccine on 12Apr2021. Two nights after her vaccine (14Apr2021), she got shaky and feeling bad and burning sensation in her body. No fever at that time, but slight elevated temp (99.7F max) the day after the vaccine (13Apr2021). Mother gave her anti-nausea medication (ondansetron hydrochloride 2 mg) and within 5 minutes her jaw got paralyzed. She couldn&#39;t talk. It lasted about 30 min. Mother called ambulance and patient was brought to ER. ER didn&#39;t do bloodwork or any evaluation. ER didn&#39;t know what happened per mother. She has been off balance this week since getting her vaccine (Apr2021). She feels better this morning but she still feels off balance. Not sleeping well at night due to pressure feeling in her chest up and she shivers to get the feeling away per patient (unspecified date). Slept better last night as of 17Apr2021. No facial drooping. She can smile and lift her eyebrows. Patient had &#34;brain fog&#34; this week as well after the vaccine. The adverse events &#34;she got shaky&#34;, &#34;feeling bad&#34;, &#34;burning sensation in her body&#34;, &#34;jaw got paralyzed&#34; and &#34;she couldn&#39;t talk&#34; resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care visit. There was no treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome was recovered on an unspecified date for the events &#34;jaw got paralyzed&#34; and &#34;she couldn&#39;t talk&#34;; recovering for the event &#34;not sleeping well at night&#34;; not recovered for the event &#34;off balance&#34;; and unknown for the rest of the events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based from temporal relation of event and vaccine administration, Trismus as an event in relation to suspected drug BNT162B2 cannot be totally excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of receiving the shot, my daughter felt hotness running down the length of her vaccinated arm and into her hand. Started feeling hot and started to produce a small patch of hives on the outside of the throat and chest. Did vigorous windmill motions with vaccinated arm.  She had a feeling of slight unwellness that was followed by a rush of energy.  As we leave the store and start to drive home her hives are a little bit worse and she says she feels a little lightheaded and has some heart palpations. But is still reporting a rush of energy. By the time we get home 10 minutes later hives,  lightheadedness, and heart palpations have resolved.  She feels great the rest of the day. Next day slight redness around the injection site and arm a bit sore. The following day redness is gone but a slight rash is starting to show up around the neck. 5 days later, the rash becomes inflamed, sore, hot and itchy, hives are full upper-body flareups. She takes Allegra 24 for hives control. Rash comes and goes daily.  Acts more like hives. Allegra 24 controls hives mostly along with icing. After a few days, the effectiveness of the Allegra 24 is not as efficient with the neck rash. Switches to Zyrtec 24 which seems to provide better relief from both hives and rash around the neck. Sees Dr. April 29th. He advises not to take a second dose of Pfizer at this time and prescribes her an EpiPen.

                                                After a few minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported dizziness, light headedness, and blurry/dots in vision. She then became more upset leading to hyperventilation and crying. She then said she had tingling in her fingers, which progressed to difficulty moving her fingers/stiff fingers, and coldness and redness in tips of fingers. She then reported she was loosing sensations in her feet and legs. 911 was called. We tried to have the patient take slow deep breaths. We offered an ice pack and water up front and a heat pack for her fingers. Paramedics arrived. Her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, glucose were within normal limits. She was given oxygen and the paramedic was able to help her slow her breathing. Her fingers went back to normal and she felt fine before leaving. She did not feel the need to go with the paramedics.

EMTs assisted patient to gravity bed where patient regained consciousness. Patient was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and event (AAO x 4) immediately following the incident. Client&#39;s vitals were assessed every 5 minutes. They were recorded as follows 10:19- Blood Pressure (BP) 100/74, Heart Rate (HR) 86, Oxygen Saturation (SPO2) 99%, and Respiratory Rate (RR) 18; 10:24- BP 100/72, HR 81, SPO2 99% RR 18; 10:29- BP 100/76, HR 82, SPO2 99% RR 16; 10:34- BP 102/74, HR 84, SPO2 99% RR 18; 10:39- BP 100/72, HR 82, SPO2 99% RR 18; 10:44- BP 110/76, HR 86, SPO2 99% RR 18. Client was given a bottle of water and instructed to remain in a semi-fowler&#39;s (45 degree) position until vitals stabilized. Patient remained on vaccination site for 30 minutes following the episode of fainting. EMT obtained orthostatic vital signs (vital trend from lying down, to sitting, to standing). Patient was negative for orthostatic hypotension. Symptoms resolved as indicated above in vital signs. Patient stated she was &#34;feeling better&#34; and declined EMS transport. Patient and father were educated by RN on home care (rest and fluids) and to seek emergency medical attention if symptoms persisted or worsened.

Mom noticed she started shaking and then slumped over in chair, mom immediately grabbed hold of pt and stabilized her while calling out for help. Within a few seconds of me running over, pt was already awake and answering questions. She removed her face mask for better air circulation, asked for some water. Mom and I continued to hold pt until she felt ready to sit on her own accord. I asked mom if she wanted me to call, EMT, She declined. Pt has had this reaction before during blood draws. I asked them to wait at pharmacy for 30 minutes, periodically checking in. After 30 minutes mom and patient left pharmacyand she said she felt better

When I reached the patient was on the floor conscious, had pulse and reported no shortness of breath,  but seemed lightheaded. Customer?s mother held customer while she?s sitting on the floor , no injury reported by customer. Pharmacy associate, was asked to call 911, and to alert Management . EMS arrived and checked patient and confirmed that the patient?s vitals were good and found out from customer that she did not eat anything since yesterday. Customer stated that she was feeling good and told EMS personnel that she did not want to be taken to the hospital. After EMS had left, customer was asked to wait at the pharmacy until she felt it&#39;s safe for her to leave. At 7:09pm , customer was asked to go home along with her mother and younger sister. Customer seemed alert, conscious and mobile.

Her mom was with her. Her mom had already given her a snack when I was notified. Pt stated her vision was blurry and her hearing was &#34;like she was in a tunnel&#34;. She was feeling cold and was feeling scared of that feeling. I asked if I could apply a cold pack and asked her to rest the back of her head against the wall and to close her eyes. I applied the cold pack to her forehead and observed her. She started to sweat and was calmer. She was feeling better and her hearing and vision was back to normal. I had her wait for a total of 30 minutes and had my technician stay with her at that time. She was feeling better and I asked her mom to hang on to her while walking to their car. I followed up with the patient 4 hours later and she was doing well. She said she was feeling well and her arm was not even sore just some fatigue.

                                                Patient became light headed and fainted from a seated position about 10 minutes after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination. She doesn&#39;t think she lost consciousness. Her skin was quite warm and sweaty after this event. I had her remain laying down on the ground while she recovered and I assessed her symptoms. She felt better almost immediately so I had her move to the pharmacy office for observation for an additional 15-20 minutes. She then reported that she has fainted with shots before and she hadn&#39;t eaten anything today. Her mother said this has happened before and drove her home once she felt well again.

She felt nauseous and dizzy. I laid her on floor with her feet elevated on a chair with her head to the side so she would not aspirate if she vomitted.. She felt better after a while and wanted to sit. When she was sitting in the armchair she vomitted and said she felt worse, so I then called 911.   They evaluated her and her blood pressure was very low and they gave her iv fluids and took her to the emergency room

Was given water and a snack and felt better. She left happy and healthy, she does not like needles/vaccination - so she had anxiety from the vaccine.

                                                Patient was very anxious and breathing heavy. About 5 minutes after the vaccination they started to hyperventilate and ended up throwing up. After letting them sit and relax for 5 minutes, the patient then had to throw up again and told their mother they felt like they were going to faint. Mother and myself stood by, while patient did end up fainting. We slowly lowered them to the ground, and on the way down their body got stiff and patient had uncontrollable movements and was hardly responsive. Mother and myself finally got her safely to the floor as they came to and was responding to verbal ques and stimulation from mother. Mother went to get water and i stayed with the patient to ensure no other things happen. Patient ended up doing alright after relaxing for a few and then i walked them and mother to their car and ensured they were feeling good enough to go home. I then advised the mother to seek medical attention.

Next, her arms went straight and locked, both her hands locked in a curled position. I looked up at her face and her eyes had rolled back into her head and her body started jerking.  Shortly after, she sat upright in chair with her eyes open and didn&#39;t realize what had happened.  She said a tingling sensation had gone up her arm.  She was extremely pale.  My tech called 911.  I took her blood pressure which was 88/46 with a pulse of 45.  As we were waiting for paramedics, she said she was sweaty and started getting abdominal cramps.  Paramedics arrived and took over her care.

A 17-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 27May2021 (at 17-year-old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On Thursday 27May2021, a few minutes after the shot she started having a very small episode of seizure that lasted for maybe 1 or 2 seconds then after that she felt a little dizzy after that and then she was fine. It&#39;s described as a very brief seizure like event. Her head, neck, back and legs stiffened up and if she would have been sitting on a stool she probably would have fallen out of her seat. She was sitting in a chair that had a back to it, though, so she did not fall out of the chair. She did not every lose consciousness and he stated that this was not a syncopal event. He reported that it happened very quickly and multiple people did not even notice that it happened. Her entire body stiffened, however, &#34;she stayed with us throughout the entire event and it only lasted a couple of seconds before her body went back to normal position, The reporter offered to call an ambulance the day of the event but the mother of the patient declined. The mother was advised to have her daughter seen by a medical provider for follow up care given the event. The mother also told the pharmacist that the patient would not be receiving the second dose and the pharmacist encouraged her to have this conversation and make that decision with the pediatrician or medical provider. Caller stated that he personally gave about 100 doses of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on that day and this was the only serious reaction that he witness. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based from timing of occurrence, the event that occurred with the patient post vaccination which Is seizure like phenomenon cannot be totally ruled out to be not related suspected drug BNT162B2.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate

                                                At around 9:25 am on Thursday, June 17th, 2021, seventeen-year-old patient walked into the vaccination site. She was accompanied by two guardians, along with 14 other minors. The minors came in for their 2nd shot of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines.  Patient signed all necessary consent forms and pre-vaccination checklist requirements with guardian and entered the vaccination section at around 9:35 am. The Pfizer vaccine was administered at 9:39 am.  Observation nurse reported that around 10:06 am the patient complained about having a severe headache, ?seeing stars?, feeling very dizzy, and not feeling well. Nurse assisted patient to lay down on the mat in case the patient may faint. Charge nurse obtained a pulse oximetry reading of 95% and a pulse of 96.   Charge nurse checked if the patient experienced any symptoms of hives/redness, shortness of breath, or any difficulty breathing or swallowing. The patient complained to observation nurse that she was having a hard time breathing, severe headache, and chest pain.   Observation nurse instructed patient to be calm and to relax. Charge nurse instructed the patient to take deep slow breaths to help increase O2 levels but the patient complained to the observation nurse that she cannot breathe through her nose.   At 10:15 am charge nurse continuously monitored the patient?s B/P, pulse, and O2 level readings. The BP reading was 117/64 with a pulse of 78 and an O2 level of 100%. At approximately 10:16 am, patient started showing signs of change in LOC and lost consciousness for a few seconds. First responder paramedics from the first minor incident were still at the scene waiting for the 2nd ambulance to arrive. The first responder paramedic did a sternum rub using his knuckles with a closed fist to the center of the patient?s chest and immediately after the patient gasped for air and regained consciousness. The patient remained in a sitting position on the floor to be able to breathe easier. At approximately, 10:18 am charge nurse took another BP reading of 121/76, a pulse of 96, and O2 level of 99%.   At approximately 10:20 am, patient started exhibiting a change in LOC and was very disoriented again. Observation nurse kept calling the patient?s name but did not get a response. This lasted for around 30 seconds while the patient gasped for air before becoming responsive again. At this time observation nurse observed that patient could not recall her name and did not know how she got there.   At approximately 10:22 am, charge nurse took another BP reading of 165/133, a pulse of  122, and an O2 level of 96%.   At around 10:24 am, the charge nurse took another BP reading of 112/78 and pulse of 112 with an O2 level of 96%. The second ambulance arrived at approximately 10:26 am and took over.   The second ambulance?s first responder paramedics left with patient at approx. 10:29 am and took her to hospital for further observation.

Initially she was not responding much to EMS and to FNP that received her, EKG was completed, and VS were within normal limits. She received lab work, UA, and CT of Head as she appeared to have hurt her head at time of fall.  Few hours later, when FNP checked on her again, about 9:50 pm, she was more responsive, answering his questions and doing much better than when she initially arrived to hospital around 8 pm. She was verbal, and VS were within normal limits during my time with her at the hospital

                                                On Fri 3/5 one of the RPhs on duty administered the vaccine around 2:45 PM. RPh advised patient to wait in the waiting room for 15 minutes to make sure she felt fine. Around 3 PM patient told another patient sitting in the waiting room that she was feeling light headed and told her to call the pharmacy staff, which she did. One of the RPhs went out of the pharmacy into the waiting room to check up on her while the other pharmacist called 911. RPh who went to check up on her found her on the floor slouching. RPh tried to shake her awake and she appeared nodding off and on. Finally after a minute of two, she became more coherent and conscious. Team member grabbed orange juice to give to her. Other patient who grabbed our attention stated she was slowly sliding off her chair. RPh stayed by her side until paramedics arrived. Although she marked &#34;No&#34; on Section B #5 on the VAR form, she stated that she gets light headed and dizzy whenever she gets blood drawn or at the dentist. Paramedics checked on her vitals, was within normal range. Patient opted not to be taken to the hospital. RPh advised patient to call a  family member to pick her up because although she felt ok to drive, she stated she felt a little nauseous and her head kind of hurts. Mother picked her up about an hour after the incident occurred.

The reaction after the shot only lasted for roughly 5 minutes, but her clothing was completely soaked from sweat. After 5 minutes, it passed and she felt much better. Medical personnel gave her water and had her sit another 30 minutes. She seemed fine after that, but they told to report the reaction.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after vaccine administered, patient started feeling nauseous and dizzy. She was also pale and clammy.  Offered patient water and allowed to remove face mask. Instructed on breathing slowly in through the nose and out through the mouth. This helped briefly but then patient verbalized that she was feeling more light headed and thought she should lie down on exam table. Remained at patient&#39;s side but did not allow her to stand up in order to relocate from chair to exam table. Approximately 7 minutes after vaccine administration, patient briefly lost consciousness for less than 30 seconds and had slight jerking movements during this time. Remained at patient&#39;s side and prevented her from falling out of chair, hitting head, or other injury during syncopal event. After patient regained consciousness, she began sipping on water. A cold, wet paper towel was placed to the back of her neck. Continued to observe patient in exam room for another 5 minutes then she was escorted to waiting area by provider. Waiting area was just outside exam room and patient remained in the presence of a patient care technician, as well as her mother. Patient remained in waiting area for a total observation time of 30 minutes. No other adverse events occurred. Patient and mother both reported that patient does not do well after vaccines and has had similar symptoms after other vaccines in the past.

                                                Approximately two minutes after vaccine injection, pt started to feel dizzy, saw spots, felt like she was going to pass out. Someone got a wheelchair and we took her back to observation/treatment area. Patient was very drowsy, felt nauseous, hands were tingling, and was cold and clammy.  We asked her to text her Mom, who was sitting out in the parking lot, to have her come inside.  Pt reported passing out with HPV vaccine and on blood draws.  We moved patient to pt bed and took vitals (listed below).  Patient was able to recover without any medication administration under close observation.  After about 20 mins in obs/treatment area, she was feeling better and we moved her to the observation room with her Mom.  We had leftover vaccine syringes, so Mom received her first dose of vaccine.  They waited together until Mom&#39;s 15 mn obs time was over.  Patient and someone left the clinic feeling fine and under their own power around 1845.

She stated that she was feeling good. I then had her stand up with me standing in front of her and asked how she was feeling. She stated that she was feeling light headed in the middle of her forehead. I had her sit back down and gave her an ice pack to put on her neck. I then asked how she was feeling and she stated that she was feeling better and while she had the ice pack on her forehead she kept eating and drinking. I then had her stand up and she stated that she was better. i took her vitals at 11:24 am heart rate 75, o2 99 and BP 115/81, again at 11:30 am heart rate 79, o2 97 and BP 117/82. I released her to go home with her mom and dad at 11:41.

I spoke to the patient and when she said she was ok I had her sit down on the chair. After about 15 minutes patient and father left and confirmed that she was doing ok.  Next morning patients dad called and said she was doing fine, that we might need to fill out paper work regarding the incident to submit it at patients school so she would not have to take the second dose.

                                                within 34 hours of the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid shot, patient began to break out in welts/hives behind her knees. She woke up in the middle of the night with her scalp itching and her ears hot as well as the welts behind her knees. Given Benadryl which helped a little for about 2 hours but then the hives just kept spreading and growing into huge swollen itchy patches on her body. By Friday afternoon, she had tried Benadryl and calamine lotion only to have it continue to get worse. We ended up with the Urgent care by 4pm Friday, 4-30-21. They gave her Prevacid and prescribed steroid cream. They told us if it got worse or affected breathing to go ER. We went home and kept taking the benedryl every 6 Hours and using the steroid cream. as one welt would begin to disappear, others would pop up. the steroid cream did not help in that regard. the benedrul would give about 50% relief for about 2 hours before the itching got very bad. Unable to sleep to do anything, we took patient to the pediatrician that Sat morning 5-1-21. She examined her and told her to take Claritin in the morning and Zyrtec at night to help. She was hestiant to prescribe any steroids due to unknown interaction or affects with the Covid shot. She told us to keep checking in with her and also if it got worse or spread to her face/mouth or any trouble breathing to go to the ER. We went home and tried to take an oatmeal bath. It only made things worse. By 10pm that Sat night 5-1-21, the hives had spread to patient&#39;s face and lips and were affecting her throat. Her voice got very raspy. we decided at that point to take her to the ER. They started her on steroids that night. She continued taking the steroids for 5 days after that. The steroids did help make her hives go away. However, within 2 days of finishing the steroids, patient noticed that she still did not feel 100%. That Saturday 5-8-21, She began to feel light-headed and off. She also began to feel fatigued. She came home from an errand needing to lay down and feeling dizzy. A few days after that, she began to have gas and indigestion, feeling like something caught in her throat and feeling nauseous. She also noticed that there a few nights in all of this that she would wake up shivering for no reason. The shivering would continue until she woke up in the morning. This report is being filed on 5-30-21. Since her 2nd shot and after the hives, we have been dealing with ongoing dizziness, fatigue, tiredness, lightheadedness and nausea to varying degrees. She has not been able to resume regular activates of being active or working out. WE have been back to the dr.

A few minutes after she sat down she felt faint and fell out of her chair and bumped her forehead.  We helped her back into the chair and held on to her.  With her permission  we had her sniff an ammonia inhalant and she said she felt a little better.   She did not want us to call 911 or anybody at home.  A pharmacy technician sat with her for about a half hour and a store manager filled out a report and said we will follow up with her later.  She said she felt better and was able to leave on her own.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; formulation solution for injection; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on an unspecified date as 2ND DOSE,SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s Disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on 31Mar2021 for covid-19 immunization and experienced severe indigestion, vomiting and did not feel well. On an unspecified date (36 hours after receiving the second dose of vaccine), the patient broke out with hives and patches all over the body with extreme itching, her ears turned red and became very hot, the hives spread to her face and into the throat. The patient was prescribed steroid creams, and she self-administered three antihistamines included Zyrtec, Claritin, &amp; Benadryl. The hives went away. After that on an unspecified date, the patient had gastrointestinal (GI) issues, she had very gassy feeling of something stuck in the throat, and had nausea to the point of being unable to eat. Also, she shivered and shakes out of the blue, felt lightheaded and dizzy with extreme fatigue. The patient received treatment with steroid creams, and antihistamines included Zyrtec, Claritin, &amp; Benadryl for the events 36h after &#34;broke out with hives and patches all over the body with extreme itching and her ears turned red and became very hot, the hives spread to her face and into the throat. The caller (reporter) mentioned that she heard that the vaccine causes problems in fertility hence caller asked for information on fertility studies with regards to the vaccine in response she was explained reports on the possible side effects, mentioned no information found for non-reported AEs, and referred to health care professional (HCP) for further guidance. Further, caller asked for information on how to treat or go about with the side in response she was informed that Pfizer was unable to make treatment recommendations specific for individual patients and referred to HCP for further guidance. Again, Caller asked, &#34;how the vaccines work&#34; in response she was explained about vaccine mechanism and CDC information. Caller asked if there was a way to measure the spiked proteins in the body as caller wanted to know how to measure/assess immunity after vaccination in response she was being explained about CDC recommendation, and referred to HCP for further guidance. Moreover, caller asked if there were other proteins in the body/organs/cells that were similar to the spike protein that our body could possibly react to in response mentioned that no information found on body components similar to the SARS-CoV2 Spike Protein, and she was referred to HCP for discussion. Caller complained and mentioned &#34;reporter don&#39;t think all this information is being made public, it just seems to me like the issues for the vaccine is much worse for her than as if she got COVID19. Reporter really hope that the Doctors/ CDC / Pfizer and all organizations would reconsider this, especially on the possibility on the issue on the body attacking its own self.&#34; The outcome of the event hives was considered as resolved while the outcome of all other reported events was unknown at the time of this report.  Information on Batch/Lot number has been requested.

An 18-years-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8736, expiration date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation (Age at Vaccination: 18years).  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) 10mg/day (as medications in two weeks) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.

She was taken to the hospital, computerized tomogram (CT) Scan, electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal, and no evidence of seizure were there. On 15May2021, the patient was diagnosed with mild con-cussion and got stitches on the chin as therapeutic measure for her chin splitting.

The patient stayed home from school for a week with memory improving each day and still did not remember completely a period of 48 hours starting around time of vaccination however, other symptoms had resolved. The patient had never fainted before. The treatment for rest of events was unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan and EKG both as normal, both on 15May2021. The outcome for mild con-cussion and significant memory loss was recovering; and rest all events were resolved.

                                                I started experiencing pain in my calf on 4/21 that same night of the vaccination.  There was a tight feeling in my knee and every time I took a step with my right leg  there was pain that radiated down my calf. It almost felt like a  muscle pain so I ignored it for a few days. By 4/24 the pain had gotten so bad that I didn&#39;t want to walk anywhere and cried when I walked. My mom came and picked me up and took me to the  urgent care center. They asked me a few questions and told me that I needed to go to the ER to get checked for a blood clot. I went to hospital on 4/24, and an ultrasound of my knee was done. The doctor diagnosed me with a blood clot and told me to stop taking the Xulane which was my birth control at the time. They told me to follow up with my OBGYN and a hematologist. (I had been on my birth control for about 6 months and  I have never had any issues with blood clots and they do not run in my family. The NP is who told me to report my blood clot to the CDC because she is a little suspicious that the shot is where it come from.)

This is first of three report. An 18-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8727; Expiry Date: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jun2021 (at the age of 18-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on an unknown date for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. On 17Jun2021, patient experienced passed out (head flew back)/ her head went back to where she appeared to of lost consciousness for about 10 seconds and then they called EMS and had HA/ headache, nausea, dizziness and elevated BP. About 10 minutes after the injection, patient started complaining of a headache, nausea and dizziness. She got to the point where she had appeared to pass out when she was sitting. The observation nurse was with her when she had complained of the headache, nausea and being dizzy and then her head went back to where she appeared to of lost consciousness for about 10 seconds. After that 10 seconds she was responsive again but she was still complaining of a headache, nausea and dizziness until the EMS arrived. Reporter stated that they have been administering this particular lot number at that location for about 2 weeks now without any incidents until today all of a sudden. 2 of the patient&#39;s reactions were kind of typical reactions that they have seen in the past. No further details provided about reactions in the past. The other one (reported in report 1 of 3) that had to be treated with an epinephrine (EPIPEN) was a pretty significant reaction and they have never had multiple reactions back to back like this. Reporter seriousness for events, her head went back to where she appeared to of lost consciousness for about 10 seconds and then they called EMS, complaining of a headache, nausea and dizziness were reported as not serious. Verbatim event relatedness: COVID vaccine: her head went back to where she appeared to of lost consciousness for about 10 seconds, complaining of a headache, nausea and dizziness were unrelated. Seriousness: She would even call it a mild to moderate reaction. She thinks that she would of been fine without medical intervention. She was okay during the time in observation without actual medical intervention other than helping to calm her down and that type of thing. Causality: She doesn&#39;t think the COVID vaccine caused the reaction necessarily. She thinks it may of been anxiety induced symptoms. The outcome for events headache was unknown and for other events was recovering. Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile and temporal relationship, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the event Loss of consciousness, Headache, nausea, Dizziness, Elevated BP  and the suspect drug BNT162B2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Pharmacist saw, wanted step down and he/she asked her if she was having any signs of the anaphylactic reactions like swelling of the face or top of the lip or tongue if she could swallow correctly, If she felt that she could breath and all of those things were normal however she said that she felt very dizzy so he/she suggested to lay her on the floor because he/she assumed that she was like she was going to faint and then started to, like her eyes sort of curl she looks like fainting. Pharmacist also stated that so, he/she would asking for questions about how she felt and then she said she felt dizzy and he/she suggested that they potentially put her on the floor in case she might faint and then she started to looks like fainting but she began to convulse in her legs in her arms and he/she would say that it happened for roughly he/she did not know 5 seconds only the mom and his/herself the mom really pulled her on the floor urgently and once she was on floor all of all of it stopped and she regained consciousness and the mom was not it was just normal thought she was fainted or she had a seizure event. The mom said that this was not something that ever happened to her daughter before with the vaccination. Pharmacist stated that the event was resolved but she was going to the hospital for a neurological (as reported). Pharmacist did not know if lab data were performed. Pharmacist stated that as he/she know of no treatment due to the event was administered. Reporter&#39;s seriousness was not specified.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 25Jan2021 08:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus, Celiac disease, COVID-19, and heartburn. Concomitant medication included insulin lispro (HUMALOG), spironolactone, fluvoxamine, and alprazolam (XANAX XR). The patient previously took gluten, magnesium ,and iodine and experienced allergies.

                                                Woke up the next morning with the most intense body aches to where I could not stand up. Vomiting continuously for 3 hours, eventually vomiting bile. Never had a fever. Took tylenol to help with the pain, as soon as it set in I fell asleep for about 3 hours. When I woke up I felt almost completely normal.

She did state she has a history of fainting from taking blood, so it&#39;s possible she fainted. She was feeling light headed and woozy and her ears were ringing just before the episode. I asked her if she wanted me to call 911 and she said no because when it had happened in the past, she had been fine. I took her blood pressure and it was 95/52. She waited in the area till 12:25 and I took her blood pressure again and it was 115/60.  She did not have any other incindent. She left with her companion. I called her at 1:27p. She had arrived home and was still doing ok.

I went over and talked with the patient who told me she was feeling faint.  I immediately elevated her legs and had someone get a cool cloth and water for her.  She told me this is a normal anxiety type reaction for her after getting vaccines.  I had her remove her mask and take deep breaths and she reported feeling better.  Once the faintness subsided after about 5 minutes I helped her to an outdoor area to get fresh air and elevated her feet again just to make sure she was ok.  We continued to observe her for 30 minutes and she reported feeling better and left.

I decided to leave after sitting for 20 minutes and go back to work because it got a little better. on tuesday.   A few hours later, my chest started to ache and my throat started to hurt. thinking I had asthma due to the heat, i ignored it and used my inhaler.   By the next day, I was coughing and it hurt worse. I was still dizzy but worse, felt neasious and had a headache. I used my inhaler twice with no help. My arm started to hurt to move, and my injection spot became a red lump.   By Thursday, I could barely take a normal breath. It hurt to walk, talk, yawn, sneeze or anything that lifted my need to breathe above bare minimum. It hurt greatly and I couldn&#39;t take a full breath. I felt like my lungs were swollen and my throat hurt to swallow. I was very dizzy and had horrible nausea.

                                                Upon resting later the day of my vaccine at home, my left arm because extremely painful and sore. Which I found to be normal and expected. However, I became very exhausted suddenly and ended up falling asleep 2-3 hours before my normal bedtime.  I woke up 12 hours later unable to motivate myself to get out of bed. Finally, I did and went to go take a shower. I had chills as soon as I got out of bed and had to sit down in the shower for 10 minutes out of exhaustion and had the water running extremely hot but I was still cold. My arm was still in extreme pain. Finally, I arose from the shower floor and began showering when I started to feel as if I was going to puke right away. I laid down in the shower quickly becoming dizzy, and tried to puke. I dry heaved once to no avail. Immediately after dry heaving, my ears went numb and the shower noise was barely audible. My hands went completely numb. Home alone, I knew I needed to get out of the shower before I passed out. I managed to step out of the shower before immediately falling and possibly blacking out for some seconds and fell to the floor and laid there for a minute. Finally, I was somehow able to grab a towel and struggle to my bedroom and laid there numb for about 10 minutes.  This episode ended at about noon but for the rest of the day, I had to sleep on and off, it exhausted me to try and eat,  I had hot flashes, more dizziness, arm pain, and nausea. I called the doctor and they said there was nothing they could do and my symptoms were normal since I had COVID-19 in December.

Within a few minutes I heard the patient&#39;s mom calling out for help. I quickly ran over to help. I observed the patient who was now sitting on the floor. Her eyes were wide and she looked shocked. I helped her mother to calm patient and asked her to remain seated. I asked her mom what happened and she stated patient twitched a couple of times and began to fall off of her chair at which point mom caught her.  Mom had blood on her arm and I noticed it had come from patient&#39;s ear where a couple of earrings were pulled as she fell. I asked if she wanted water and quickly provided her a bottle of water. Mom stated that patient had fainted from vaccine(s) in the past, but mom stated that this appeared to look like a seizure. Mom went to get a chocolate bar since patient had had nothing to eat and they were worried about low blood sugar. After patient looked like she was back to normal I left to administer another vaccine but asked mom to remain until she felt necessary. Mom and patient advised my tech that they were ok and they left the store.

                                                19-year-old with no significant past medical history presenting to ED after experiencing lightheadedness, vomiting, vision changes after receiving her first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine. History is consistent with vasovagal syncopal episode given resolution of symptoms in a quick period of time. Must also consider anaphylactic reaction to vaccine given patient had vomiting and low blood pressures following vaccine administration. However, this is less likely given that patient returned to baseline blood pressures without any additional interventions and has had no additional episodes of vomiting since presenting to the emergency department. Must also consider pregnancy given vomiting and recent Plan B usage

                                                I Received the shot at 10:45am on April the 15th, no side effects except arm soreness afterward. Then at around 7:40pm that same night, I began getting terrible itchy on my face, back, arms, and neck. It worsened and I started having trouble breathing (it felt like my throat had tightened)/a hoarse voice, and my pulse was faster than usual and I felt woozy and tired.. I called a nurse hotline and she recommended for me to be seen at an ER, and I went home to tell my parents and they called a doctor friend, and I was told to take Benadryl and if anything got worse to go to the ER. The next day when I woke up I felt mainly tired and had a slight cough and was scheduled a telehealth appointment, and I am taking Zyrtec 10mg and Pepsin 20mg daily x one week with Benadryl as a back up in case the symptoms flare up, and am advised to go to the ER if the breathing issues return. In terms of symptoms now, I am just a little itchy.

                                                Patient slumped into chair in the observation area. I rushed to her. She was hyperventilating, but not wheezing or making any high pitched sound while breathing. Patient was conscious, and could answer my questions coherently. Patient was told to take off her mask so she can breath more easily. Patient kept saying &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34; and was told there&#39;s nothing to feel sorry for, and we wanted to make sure she was fine. Pulse was slightly elevated. Hands were warm and sweaty. Patient asked for a bottle of water. After drinking some water she felt better. It was likely a panic attack episode. I checked on her five minutes later. She just finished talking on the phone with a family or friend. She was a lot better at this point. She agreed that that was likely a panic attack. I advised her she should be able to receive the 2nd dose later, but should consult her PCP.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date not reported), intramuscular on 23Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergies from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, it was unknown if the patient has been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine 60 mg taken for an unspecified indication, and an unspecified oral contraceptive. It was reported that on 23Mar2021, the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine and felt a little dizzy on 11:00. She also started noting mumbling, slurred speech, passed out for about 15 (unspecified) after using the bathroom, developed a &#34;static&#34; feeling in her head and then noted her left eye shutting and then weakness in her left arm and leg. She was taken to the Emergency Room (ER) for evaluation. Symptoms lasted about 5 hours. She fell asleep in the ER. Symptoms seemed to clear by about 8:30 PM. She had lab and head CT at the hospital which were essentially normal. She felt okay the next day, but had some nausea for a couple days starting on the 3rd day on 25Mar2021. She stated she feels fine at the time of report in the Student Health Clinic and asked whether she should receive her second Pfizer dose scheduled on 20Apr2021. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The outcome of the event nausea was recovered in Mar2021, and for other events was recovered on 23Mar2021 20:30.   Information about lot/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product BNT162B2 and the reported event Passed out. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Arm tremors continued for some time the second day, and on and off for the past two weeks. Extreme muscle and body pain for the past 2 weeks, muscle twitching that subsides and returns. Since then, discussing her illness with medical providers brings on the return of the hand and arms shaking/tremors. In addition, warm water, showers lead to the hand and arm shaking/tremors as well. She saw her primary care physician on Friday April 16 who witnessed the shaking/tremors coming on. She was referred to a muscular neurologist at  hospital and seen there by Dr.  on Tuesday April 20 who also witnessed the shaking/tremors and diagnosed functional movement disorder.

I lowered patient to the floor, flat on her back and elevated her feet in a chair. Her mask was removed and an ice pack was placed on her forehead. We provided patient with orange juice as well. After some time laying down, she was able to sit up on the floor and waited seated on the floor for additional time and drank the orange juice. After an additional 10-15 minutes, patient felt that she was no longer feeling faint and was comfortable to leave the pharmacy.

Went to ER. Was given a COVID test (awaiting results at this time) as well as some muscular shots of Toradol, Benadryl &amp; Reglan. Felt better within 30 mins and was discharged to go home.

                                                Patient began to feel light headed about 5 minutes afterward.  She came up to the counter to tell us and by the time we got to her with a chair she fainted into the technicians arms.  We sat her down and she was only unconscious for about 3 seconds.  We called 911.  She asked for some water and we also gave her some OJ.  By the time the paramedics got here she was pretty much back to normal and said she knew it was because she was anxious.  She signed a refusal for the paramedics and sat for a few more minutes before she said she felt fine to leave.

                                                I got my vaccine Wednesday afternoon and woke up that night with a fever, muscle aches and spasms, a headache, and dizziness. My fever got up to 101.2 F by 3:00 Thursday morning, when I finally decided to take Tylenol. That eventually brought my fever down and kept it down. I was extremely tired throughout the day Thursday and had full body muscle aches, but I stopped taking Tylenol Thursday evening and my fever did not return. On Friday morning, I woke up extremely dizzy. I had trouble moving around and felt nauseous from the dizziness. It improved throughout the day and was nearly gone by the time I got up Saturday morning. By Sunday morning, my symptoms were pretty much resolved.

Told her brother who was sitting next to her that she &#34;thought she was going to pass-out&#34;. Brother held her in chair and patient lost conscious for about three seconds but was supported by brother. I, , PA-C was alerted during the event and visually witnessed it and went to the patient who was regaining consciousness at that time still in her chair. I asked her how she was feeling and she said &#34;okay&#34;. There was concern for possible anaphylaxis due to paling of skin and epinephrine was given in the left thigh without complications. No other signs of anaphylaxis were noted including no lip/tongue/mouth swelling; no wheezing; no hives. The patient was layed on the ground with her legs elevated which she states greatly improved her symptoms; and the patient was given orange juice to drink which she tolerated well. EMS arrived and evaluated the patient within about 10 minutes and the patient was feeling well at that time.  Patient never hit her head during the episode. Patient who was accompanied by mother decided not to go to the ED at this time for further evaluation as the patient states her symptoms felt similar to previous episodes of syncope. ED precautions were given to patient and patient to follow-up with PCP recommended.

After about 5-10 minutes, she slumped in her chair, then fell to the floor. She seemed to hit her head on the concrete floor. She was unresponsive at first, but had pulse and clear airway. Staff turned her on her side and protected. Her eyes were fluttering and rolling back. Within 3 minutes, she was able to respond to questions with her name, though she was disoriented. EMS was called at that time. She stated she had not eaten anything today, so she was given small sips of apple juice. After 5 more minutes, she was more oriented and responding to commands. EMS arrived and assisted her to a seated position. She was transported by EMS to hospital.

EMT evaluated patient, diagnosed with near-fainting episode related to anxiety. EMTs do not believe response was vaccine related. BP, sugars, and all other tests within normal limits. Mom arrived and patient left pharmacy once she calmed down.

                                                Dizziness and fatigue in head developed and lasted for two weeks after the shot that was administered on April 25th..  About 5 days after the shot in the evening, I experienced hot, shooting pain in left leg that felt like a band around my thigh but would sometimes shoot down into my calf and feet. My feet would feel tingly and sore. I experienced shooting pain on and off again in my left and right arms as well as my right leg, but the pain in my left thigh stayed for over a week. The feeling in my legs made it difficult to sleep.  Two weeks after the shot on Wednesday May 12th at 11am, the dizziness and fatigue made me lightheaded and I could not keep my eyes open. My head got really hot and my vision blurred and I could feel my heart beating in my head loudly and all over my body. I tried to walk to my thermometer to take my temperature but struggled to hold things in my hands or walk properly. My sister called my mother who took me to the Emergency Room around 11:50. The doctors took urine and blood samples, X-rayed my chest and did an EKG but could not figure out what was wrong with me and discharged me at 3pm.

A 19-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 04May2021 15:05 (time also reported as &#34;15:00&#34;) [Batch/Lot Number: EW0167; Expiration Date: 30Aug2021 (expiration date also reported as &#34;31Aug2021&#34;)] as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing ADHD which she had since she was little, 3rd grade, born with only one kidney, anxiety and whenever she has anxiety she does get some hives. Concomitant medications included ongoing methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA) since she was in grade school, probably 3rd grade for ADHD and birth control pill which the reporter was unsure of the name, she switched to this one about 2 months ago. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had a reaction with the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. The patient felt very hot, very nauseous, dizzy, and broke out in hives on her arms, chest and back on 04May2021. She was given Benadryl, anti-nauseous medicine, Zofran, and some Pepcid. The patient felt fine afterwards. The patient&#39;s mother wanted to know if her daughter should still receive the 2nd dose on 25May2021. The patient was dizzy and felt like heat rushed through her body, she was nauseous and broke out in hives on her arms back and chest. The patient still has some arm pain, left arm which started on 04May2021, but everyone had that, and it has improved. The patient went to the hospital ER. The facility administering the vaccines had EMS and since she was having a reaction, they didn&#39;t give her a choice, they just took her to the ER and was glad they did. The patient was seen in the ER and released after she was observed for 4-5 hours.  She doesn&#39;t know if it was from anxiety or if it was a reaction, she has concerns about whether or not her daughter should take the second dose. The patient stated that about 5 minutes into waiting her 15 minutes, she had a very bad allergic reaction to the vaccine on 04May2021. She ended up getting sent to the hospital. She explained that the vaccine facility had EMT and police at the site and they are the ones who suggested she be taken to the hospital. She clarified that as soon as she got the vaccine, she got hives on her chest, neck, arms and back. The hives are still going on at this time. She has some anxiety and whenever she has anxiety, she does get some hives, however these hives were different. She was anxious about getting the vaccine - she hates needles, but it was a different kind of hives/kind of feeling. She felt very nauseous, dizzy, and tired on 04May2021. She still feels very nauseous right now. The patient was seen in the ER and released at 8PM, she was never admitted into the hospital (the hospitalization was later verified as an ER visit only). She saw her doctor today. The events required a visit to emergency room on 04May2021 and physician office on 05May2021. The outcome of the events &#34;felt very hot/felt like heat rushed through her body&#34;, dizzy, and hives was recovered on 05May2021, nauseous was not recovered, and arm pain was recovering. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Three days after patient took the vaccine she felt light head and dizzy.  She went to the doctors and they did a number of test and eventually referred her to a cardiologist.  The cardiologist saw swelling or enlargement of her heart.  Patient took a stress test and afterward felt fine.  However, the swelling of the heart was concerning.  She never had any issues before taking the vaccine.  More tests scans are planned, to see what is going on.

She walked to the front of the store and and started felling dizzy, therefore, mom had patient sit down on the floor. Our store manager noticed she was on floor and cam over to offer assistance. Pt&#39;s mom said she pass out and was not feeling good. I was paged and upon going to front of the store saw the patient on the floor. I came up to and ask how she&#39;s feeling and noticed she was flushed and warm. An associate got her some water and a chair. Our store manager offered to call 911 and mom did not want an ambulance called and after 15 to 20 minutes of sitting in the chair drinking water, patient was able to leave the store with no assistance. I called to check on Pt at 5:30pm and she was feeling good with no other issues.

She lost consciousness for less than a minute.  She lost color in her skin and was confused when she woke up.  Her mother and brother were with her and called for help.  The pharmacist and a technician also went out to assist.  Patient was seated in the chair and assisted the whole time not to fall out or get up and walk after waking back up.  She was given a cold compress and water.  Her blood pressure was taken and was WNL. We asked them to stay in the pharmacy an additional 15-30 minutes after to watch over her.  Her mother and brother were able to stay with her in the waiting room.  After resting for an additional 20 minutes patient was able to walk out on her own and color returned to her body.  Her mother felt comfortable taking her home at this point.  Patient is very nervous about shots and had little to eat today.

                                                My daughter was fine on the first day.  She woke up the next day with a weird headache that her scalp hurt.  She went into work and started to feel poorly throughout the day.  When she came home, she went to bed at 4:30 pm as she had aches &amp; pains, continued headache, felt nauseous, tired, and noticed her left leg where she had surgery previously was bothering her with pins and needles. I told her to go to bed and she would be fine the next day. On 5/26, her leg was giving her increased problems where she could not flex her foot, nerve pain in her leg along with numbness, and she still had the headache. I told her to call her primary care physician and the nurse had her go the the ER.  They ran no tests, but consulted with neuro on call and surgeon who performed surgery on her leg two years ago.  She was instructed to follow-up with a neuro and start PT.  We got her into a PT. The next day she continued to have same issues, but her leg pain increased.  She followed up via phone twice to primary where the nurse told her to go back to the ER. She had blood work, ultra sound and x-ray.  She saw neurologist on  6/2 and is scheduled for follow-up with an EMG on 6/14.  She has seen physical therapist 6x since 5/26 and still has numbness, nerve pain, etc.  The form from neuro office said left foot drop and parathesia. She has had headaches this week including a migraine on 6/8.

                                                Pfizer COVID vaccine administered 04/27/21. Reports that she started feeling unwell almost immediately after injection.  Immediate Reaction (onset &lt;5 min) associated with the following symptoms:  ? Visible swelling and pain at the injection site  ? Increased nasal secretions and eye tearing ? Chills Around 30 minutes after, she had also developed: ? Swelling of the tongue (felt &#34;heavy&#34;) ? Flushing, diaphoresis, and nausea, followed later by vomiting ? Dizziness/lightheadedness/weakness ? Dyspnea, wheezing, and cough ? Hives on arms and chest    No throat tightening or tachypnea. She did not attempt speech.  No one in the clinic took her blood pressure or pulse ox   The patient brought her epi pen with her but elected not to use it. Left after 30 minute observation period.  Thinks that the people at the vaccine clinic did not recognize that she had hives because of her dark complexion.  The people administering vaccines were not medically trained    Patient&#39;s mom recognized that she was not feeling well when she picked her up.  She took benadryl which helped with allergy symptoms.  She then developed fever up to 102.3, chills, headache, nausea, and myalgias x 5 days

                                                Routine covid 19 vaccination using Pfizer requested by patient.  All screening questions were answered by patient and received the vaccination without incident.  Approximately 3 minutes after she received vaccination she came back in the professional services room with her father, as he received his vaccination she complained of becoming dizzy and was told to go have a seat in the waiting area.  She was sitting with her mother for another moment and her mom became concerned because the patient urinated on the floor while she was sitting there and seemed to lose consciousness.  We responded to the patient who was awake but was extremely pale.  Warehouse management was called over and they observed the patient and made the decision to call 911 based on the mother&#39;s concern.  Paramedics arrived within 10 minutes and recorded very low blood pressure and were concerned she may have had a seizure.  The decision was made to take the patient to the hospital because her blood pressure was still remaining low after approximately another 10 minutes.  I called the phone number on her immunization consent form the next morning (6/15/21) and again in the evening but was able only to leave a voice mail.

Patient had been told to wait for 15 minutes after vaccination but was thirsty and went to her car to grab some water. When outside, patient felt dizzy and fainted, falling and hurting her head and leg. Ambulance was called but patient refused any care and wanted to go home. We had the patient call a friend/family to pick her up.  When asked, patient reported not having eaten today and vaccination was given approximately at 2:30 pm.

Last Friday (unspecified May2021) she was vaccinated with the Pfizer and she got a lot of symptoms of the vaccine,  after 20 seconds she fell on the floor and she lose all the conscious and took that it was minute and half to come up and she got a kind of choke, cannot breathe and lose all the energy, it took almost 2 days to become normal again. The patient&#39;s mother did not want her to get another shot. The outcome of events was recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

OTC sudafed seems to alleviate some of the vertigo and fatigue.

                                                Received the shot at 2:10.  2:15, she was feeling light headed and tingly sensation in her extremities. She didn&#39;t let anyone know at this time.  The person observing her noticed she seemed  zoned out and asked how she was doing at about 2:17 and learned that her tingliness was  turning into numbness of  extremities focused on her upper body.  She started displaying other symptoms of a minor panic attack.  We monitored her for the full 30 minutes, had her walk around, drink water, etc. She claimed that while her numbness wasn&#39;t getting better, it also wasn&#39;t getting worse. It was starting to itch though, so she was given some benedryl.  She then went home for the evening where her roommate could monitor her.   Next day, she called in to confirm that her numbness/itchiness had turned into a rash on her chest which has disappeared. But now is experiencing diarrhea, headache, weakness and dizziness.  She was informed that these symptoms were within the normal range of immune responses, but that if she was too miserable, she could go in to urgent care for medical assistance. She declined to do so at that time (approximately 11:45 am).

I went home, got rest and took Tylenol as directed. After 2 or 3  days, I felt better.

Had headache for the rest of the day until 7pm but was not a migraine after the nap and Tylenol. I would never get this vaccine again. I would rather have covid 1000 more times. (I had it in October and no sickness I?ve ever had will ever compare to that two hours of hell.

A 20-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown ), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 at 10:30 AM (at the age of 20-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included allergy to eggs. Historical vaccination included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown ), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 10:30 AM (at the age of 20-years-old) in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The vaccine was administered in a hospital. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The reporter explained that the patient&#39;s adverse events &#34;started as expected&#34; with a  headache side effect (date not specified), however two days after the vaccine, while working as an EMT the patient became very dizzy and had to stop work. She remained dizzy, like vertigo, the next day but attempted to go to work. Her co-worker could see she wasn&#39;t right and took her to the hospital. The patient spent two days in the hospital, barely able to stand, getting a head MRI with contrast, evaluated for vertigo, blood tests, and they did not find anything and gave her vertigo medicine and sent her home. She has since had shifting symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, irregular heartbeat, severe upper back and neck pain. She has barely been able to move for several weeks and has seen an ENT doctor, another emergency doctor, and her regular doctor. None have found any other cause and have tried treating her with steroids. The events were treated with Meklazine and unspecified steroids. Lab data included SARS-CoV-2 test COVID 19 testing on 28Jan2021 which was negative. The clinical outcomes of headache, dizziness, vertigo, difficulty standing, swollen glands, irregular heart rate, back pain, neck pain and unable to more for several weeks were reported as not recovered.  The patient was tested for COIVD-19 after the vaccination, on 28Jan2021, and was found to be negative.

It seems like I was doing too much movement to my body. Once having this effect, even when I sit or lay down, the room seems to be spinning.

I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

                                                Patient lost consciousness for a minute while waiting in the pharmacy after her vaccination. She slid down from the chair she was sitting on and recovered consciousness soon after laying down on the floor. She mentioned she was dizzy but otherwise alright. No signs of allergy, had cold hands. Symptoms indicated syncope but witnesses mentioned they saw her having a small seizure, where she threw her hands and head back before sliding down. 911 was called, they checked her and walked her to her car and let her go with a friend.

While sitting in the observation area she reports dizziness within 10 minutes of receiving her vaccine. She denied SOB, itching, nausea and pain. No swelling or erythema at the injection site. As the patient walked with EMS over to the stretcher, she had a syncopal episode. EMS was able to help her to the stretcher without falling to the floor. Her symptoms lasted only a few minutes. Her vital signs were all within normal range. She was given water and rested for about 30 minutes and symptoms resolved.

These symptoms lasted throughout the night into the morning. In the morning on Saturday (3/27), and for most of the day I felt fatigued and slightly nauseous. At 5:00 PM that night, I was walking in the hall of my residence when I experienced a syncopal episode, which has never happened to me before. I fainted several times and my roommate brought me to the ER. Other than low BP, my EKG and other vitals looked fine, and the doctor sent me home with the conclusion it was likley related to the vaccine. The next day, Sunday 3/28, I felt naseua and dizziness all day.

                                                Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. Upon administration, patient reported she felt as though she was having an anxiety attack. She then fainted and started falling forward in her chair. The pharmacist and technician caught the patient as she fell forward and as they were leaning her back in the chair she began seizing in their arms for approximately 5-10 seconds (no more than 20-30 seconds). At this point, the patient spoke and stated that was weird and said she felt lethargic. Another technician was on the phone with 911 at this time. We gave her a bottle of water and kept the patient seated in the immunization room until EMS arrived. She was complaining of being very hot and lethargic. EMS arrived and checked her vitals and recommended the patient go with them to the hospital due to B/P and pulse being very low (exact vitals were not communicated to us). She agreed to go to the hospital and we will be following up with the patient tomorrow.

Thursday morning, I started to feel extremely sluggish and I struggled to catch my breath.  1-10 (10 being severe) I would rank this at a 5. Friday morning is when I really felt like an 8 and my listed symptoms weighed me down. I would define these symptoms as episodes. Each episode would last a couple of minutes and I would return to my normal state. I felt an 8 till the following Sunday/ Monday. Tuesday, felt a little better.

My stomach has been cramping nonstop and symptoms are still not gone over 5 days after receiving the vaccine. I?m worried about long term effects and how the second dose will react in my body. My symptoms were so severe I almost went to the ER but instead contacted my doctor who said they can?t do anything, and I need to ?ride it out?. I can?t eat anything without feeling extremely sick, and the nausea when it comes lasts up to 12 hours until my next meal.

Every time the minutes passed I felt it more. After the 15 minutes passed, I notified him and a paramedic gave me all the vital signs which had an elevated blood pressure and an elevated pulse. They took me to the ambulance where I was under supervision. I continued with the sensation of throat and dizziness. I took the medicine that the doctor had prescribed: benadryl and prednisone in case of having an allergic reaction. I continued with the symptoms and my mother was watching me in case of having difficulty breathing and when I got home I got a little nauseous. Present tiredness and pain in the area that disappeared on Sunday. From Sunday until today I have presented insomnia since it is difficult for me to sleep and I manage to sleep a few hours.

                                                Full body aches starting the day after i received the vaccine. The next day the body soreness was severe enough to where it was painful to clench my fist or walk even a small distance. I also experienced nausea, loss of appetite, migraines and light sensitivity, and was unable to do normal tasks around the house for about 3-4 days. The full body soreness was the most debilitating symptom and certain aresa like elbows, knees, wrists and hips were painful to the touch. I think my joints were most affected. The soreness and pain can be compared to a flu but it was more intense than anything i have experienced before.

This is something that happens sometimes with my health issues. I think the second dose triggered my medical conditions and made me symptomatic. I haven?t had that happen in close to a year. Woke up around 11am on 4/21 with a bad headache, body pain, a sore arm, and feeling fatigued. Had to lay in bed until about 3pm when I finally started to feel a bit better.

                                                20 yr old Female patient received first dose Pfizer covid19 vaccine in left arm administered by pharmacy intern at 3:27pm .  supervising pharmacist was (Name) pharmD.   Prior to patient receiving the covid19 vaccine  pharmD reviewed and went over all the DUR and digital patient questionnaire questions.  Mother of patient was present and mentioned that in the patient&#39;s past , the patient had fainted after receiving a vaccine.  PharmD told patient that because this occurred in the past, the patient will have to wait 30 minutes after vaccine administration for observation.    Patient was sitting in post-vaccination area, and about 3 minutes later patient&#39;s father notified staff , that patient felt dizzy and  looked pale and had blurry vision and patient was sweating.  PharmD  asked the patient if she had any difficulty breathing and if she felt itchy or had any rash as a result of the vaccine reaction.    We immediately called the pharmacy and notified (Name) of the situation.  The patient refused us to contact 911 and refused 911 care.  The pharmacy manager immediately arrived to the Clinic fitting room area.  Upon arrival,  the pharmacy manager provided alcohol swabs to patient to inhale because at that moment we did not have ammonia inhalants. PharmD  quickly made his way to the pharmacy to obtain the ammonia inhalants , which is a respiratory stimulant.  The pharmD returned to the Covid19 clinic with ammonia inhalants, which were never used, because we did not see the need.  Patient remained conscious the entire incident.    We decided not to  use epinephrine.   The pharmD measured the patient&#39;s blood pressure at 3:38pm .  bp reading was 109/65.  Pharmacy manager took pt temperature at 3:45pm, reading was 97F.  Pharmacy manager retook blood pressure at 4pm.  bp reading was 93/63, pulse of  72.   The pharmacy manager advised the patient to seek medical attention if patient continues to get worse.  bp was lower the second reading.  The pharmacy manager asked  patient a second time at 4pm if patient wanted us to call 911 again, and again patient refused us to contact 911.

The patient stated that she was back to her normal self. I released the patient home with mom and other sister at 10:35 am.

Her condition of shaking got worse over period of time and she complained about shortness of breath and she was gasping for air . I asked her if she had or experienced the allergic reaction in the past and she got the prescription EPIPEN from md but didn&#39;t have it with her. I injected EpiPen 0.3mg IM.  After5-10 minutes later, she complained about numbness on her extremities and tingling sensation on her finger and she still experiencing tremors.  We had to call the ambulance and they arrived within 5-7 minutes.

I was nauseated, sweating, shaking, experienced tingling in the hands and feet, tunnel vision, and temporary loss of hearing.

However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep.

After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

She states these symptoms are common due to her history of EDS but today they are slightly worse since she got the vaccine. She was brought to the medical evaluation area via wheelchair and evaluated by us and EMS. Patient was administered Benardyl 50mg and provided orange juice and water. Vitals taken throughout and were slightly high in the beginning and then stabilized. Patient states her throat felt better and the tingling localized to her hands after 5 mins.

She was informed her 2nd dose should be administered at a facility where she can be observed closely. She declined transport to the hospital but agreed to follow up to the ER with any worsening signs of anaphylaxis. The nausea resolved and she felt less groggy upon leaving with her boyfriend.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 09:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No family history relevant to adverse events. Patient has no concomitant medications. On 16Jan2021 09:20, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient felt like she was going to pass out reported as vasovagal reaction, and experienced heart beat was high, fatigue, woozy/dizzy, hard to concentrate, feeling hot, and felt as though she was on the verge of a headache but never got one/she felt like the blood was rushing to her head. On 16Jan2021 10:00, 1 hour after vaccination, the patient experienced had to fall asleep. On the day she got the shot she sat for a full hour with the nurse to be monitored. Then she went home. The events lasted from 09:20 until 18:00 on that day. 13 days after vaccination on 29Jan2021, 12:00 and ongoing until reporting time, the symptoms recurred about the same when they started. The patient was wondering if this could be a side effect 2 weeks after getting the shot or if she should look elsewhere on what could be causing these events. She is supposed to get the second dose on Friday and was wondering about getting the second dose after her experience. Patient wanted to know it is safer for her to have the 2nd dose. No physician office visit and emergency room visit. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was recovered on 16Jan2021 18:00.

                                                I received my shot at 11:47 and started to lose sensation in my hands in the waiting area. After about 25 minutes I felt dizzy and was about to stand up but my muscles started shaking. My heart rate was checked and found to be 140. This lasted for about another 30 minutes. My heart rate went down and I was taken to a private area and checked out by EMS they gave me water and concluded it was some sort of panic attack. However, these are the same symptoms I have whenever I am allergic to a medication, NSAIDS, dicyclomine, etc. It always starts with ascending numbness from my fingers to the rest of my body. Then I start to shake and my heart rate goes way up. Usually I start to cough then vomit and my airway closes. Thankfully this time we were able to slow the process and I never experienced some of the last symptoms.

                                                Patient experienced syncope after administration of her first COVID vaccine. Her mother is a physician and was present, providing care for her by fanning, comforting and helping her to lie down on the floor next to the waiting chairs. The patient did not faint. She did experience what appeared to be heavy breathing and light-headedness. We provided an ice pack from the immunization cart. The mother stated that the patient experiences this reaction every time she receives a vaccine due to her fear of needles. After about 30 minutes the patient was up and smiling. The family was thankful for our concern and help.

                                                Patient was nervous before the vaccination. After vaccination she started to feel hot and cold. Her hearing started to fade in and out. She sought help and was directed to lay flat on the floor and breathe. She started feeling light headed and that her vision was tunneling. Her appearance was pale and her hands were clammy. Her blood pressure was taken via wrist and was normal for her (112/72). The medical professional tending to her had her continue talking, asked her to state her DOB, name, age, the date, etc.  After about 5 minutes she started to feel better- she sat up and had some water and M&amp;Ms. She then laid back down but continued to converse with us. This took place over about10 minutes from first symptoms. She remained laying down for about 10 minutes after and then slowly sat up, and when she felt comfortable sitting she tried standing up. She then went home for the day (was an employee of the store).

No swelling in face or throat and could speak well with no problems. Patient was monitored for an extended amount of time and had driver to take her home.

                                                Around 10 minutes after getting the shot, felt sudden wave of light headedness/dizziness. About 40 minutes prior I had a snack and immediately after the shot I had another snack. I also had been drinking water. At one point I felt that I was close to passing out. I also had tingling/numbness in my feet/legs in certain positions and had to move them. I went through the drive through for the vaccine and so I sat in the car drinking water and breathing deeply for about 20-30 minutes. It gradually got better but never fully gone. When I got home some of the light headedness got a little worse when I had to stand up and walk even though I did it slowly. Even an hour after, side effects still lingering and have not yet gone as I fill this out.

The dizziness was almost to the point of making me fall unconscious, and I felt very warm the entire time. The dizziness was followed by very severe shaking.

The patient stated that nobody in the (Pharmacy name) was prepared to react to these symptoms and the rescue took too long to come in, when they came in she was feeling better and did not see the need of going to the hospital.

Right after getting the vaccine she experienced her throat tightening - stated she felt off- was shaky, lightheaded and heart racing. She came to the observation station- while sitting for observation she felt she wanted to get away from everyone else and came to the check in desk. Her symptoms started to subside when I escorted her to the recliner.  I gave her some Gatorade   bP 90/60 pulse 80.  She was feeling less anxious   O2 sat done at 11:51 99 % she stated she was feeling fine .  repeat BP 104/60 p 60 at noon.  I checked with lead at the clinic who agreed she should stay till 12:10 She felt fine when she left this nurse discussed the plan if she needed help would be to go to urgent care or call police if it was urgent.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the shot, I started to have a bit of swelling in my throat that was almost identical to the reactions I get from foods I am allergic to with my Oral Allergy Syndrome. Another 10-15 minutes later, it had gotten worse to the point where it was harder to swallow, plus I was a bit lightheaded and my mouth was itchy. The people monitoring the post vaccine waiting section didn?t want me walking around, so they sent someone to my car to get my liquid Benadryl, which is what I take for similar reactions to foods. I took about 50-75 mg worth and waited for an additional hour or so until the swelling had gone down mostly. Now (at almost 7 pm on the same day), I still have a tiny bit of swelling in addition to the ?normal? vaccine side effects, tiredness, soreness in my whole body, headache, pain at injection site.

I continued to monitor the patient and took her blood pressure (128/77, HR 80). Over the next 2 minutes, she then complained that her throat was sore and started to feel tight. At that time, I informed that patient that I was going to administer a dose of Epinephrine. She was responsive and understood. I called for medical attention and the paramedics arrived to take over patient&#39;s care.

I stayed next to her as a team member got a cold bottle of water and used as a compress on back of neck. She stated it was intensifying.  I had the store manager call 911 she appeared to pass out for a second as she came around she said her tongue was sore. but no problems breathing, itching , hives or swelling of tongue.  the other symptoms reduced .  the EMS arrived and she was feeling better.  EMS took Blood pressure and heart rate - both were normal.  She refused to be transported and EMS waited until she could stand.  I recommended to call the primary care physician to discuss seconf dose and posssilby have the second dose at a mass vaccination site where there is a physician because it took 15 miuntes for EMS to arrive.

                                                I felt severe arm pain after the injection.  About 12 hours later I had a fever of 100.1 and went to bed.  At 1 am I went to the restroom and passed a good deal of blood as I am on my period.  I got up and then fell to the floor.  Then I went to my parents bedroom and fell again.  I drank two bottles of water and took Tylenol at that point and after about two hours I felt better and went to sleep.  I also twisted my ankle when I fell the first time.  I have never fainted nor have I had such severe cramps or passed so much blood associated with a period.

                                                A few minutes after injection patient complained of feeling dizzy and shaky, she thought it might be from anxiety.  About 10 minutes after injection nursing staff asked that I check on patient.  She was alert oriented, trying to be calm but was anxious.  No rash or swelling to upper chest/face noted.  Nurses report she was pale but never diaphoretic.  Patient denies trouble breathing, she was eupneic and breath sounds clear to auscultation, no coughing.  Heart rate 110.  Patient c/o lump in her throat.  Given Epinephrine 1:1000,  0.3 ml SQ R upper arm.  After about 5 minutes patient reports lump in throat has subsided.  She was tremoring, heart rate 110-120.  About 8 minutes later she was given Benadryl 25 mg PO from marked pill bottle in her purse.  About 12 minutes after 1st epinephrine dose she stated the lump in throat feeling was coming back.  Gave another dose of Epinephrine 0.3 ml and called EMS.  When EMS arrived about 10 minutes later patient said no lump in throat. it just felt dry.  O2 sat 99$  Heart rate 130, BP 130/60.  Transported to ER.  Called patient next day to check on her.  Reports in ER given IV steroids, sent home on PO steroids and an epinephrine pen.  Told not to get second dose of vaccine.  Patient states hasn&#39;t had any problems since.  Never had a rash or swelling or trouble breathing.

Over time they became less frequent and now, on week three, I&#39;m fine. However this has made me. Nervous about the second shot. I did not see any warnings of long term dizziness which is apparently not that uncommon.. This should be listed on the warnings for the vaccine. If this occurs again after my second dose I will file another report.

                                                A few hours after my shot I started to feel dizzy and nauseous. I threw up about 3 hours after I got it and had a fever. I went home where I had chills, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, and pain all over my body for most of the day. I took 2 ibuprofen. Both of my arms broke out in hives/rashes and were extremely itchy. At bedtime I was so cold with the chills that I had uncontrollable shaking and shivering even though I was completely bundled up. I took 2 more ibuprofen (6 hours had passed since I took the last 2). I could not sleep because my body was in so much pain and I couldn&#39;t eat or drink because, if I even took a sip of water, I would throw it up. I was getting up to vomit all night long. Eventually I could keep food down but I still couldn&#39;t sleep because my body was in so much pain. I took 2 ibuprofen (again, 6 more hours had passed) and I did fall asleep. The next morning I woke up and took 2 ibuprofen as I was in so much pain all over my body that I couldn&#39;t get up and out of bed. I stuck to the BRAT diet because my stomach was still upset and I didn&#39;t want to vomit again. After that I slowly started feeling better. I am not at 100% yet but huge improvement.

Some digestive issues (upset stomach, very frequent small bowel movements) remained until Day 9.

Than in the early morning on 04/19/2021 I became absolutely horribly ill with severer vomiting and the inability to keep anything down, sipping water made me vomit immediately. I had horrendous heart burn but the vomiting was so bad I couldn&#39;t even finish chewing a tum before it came up. I had body aches, chills, was over heating, and had lots of horrible pain from heart burn and vomiting. I couldn&#39;t keep fluids down end till 3:30 in the afternoon, I wasn&#39;t able to eat anything end till the next day.

Her eyes rolled back and she started shaking  while her brothers were supporting her in the chair making sure that she wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. she stiffened up and kept shaking while foaming at  the mouth slightly. she started coming back to consciousness as she sat up and coughed up mucous. she started to feel better after this event as I also got her some water. Paramedics then arrived and took over care for her a few minutes later.

About 1 minute later, the patient&#39;s brother called for help while we were filling up a cup of water for her. At this time she became unresponsive and head rolled back in chair. Appeared clammy and possible swelling in the face. Pharmacist went to prepare Epi-Pen, but patient became responsive again (about 15 seconds later) before pharmacist could administer. 911 was called by technician at first sign of unresponsiveness. EMT arrived and questioned patient, at which time she was talking quietly and still nauseous. She was hauled out on a stretcher and taken care of by emergency personnel. Unknown status after that.

This 21-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0153), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Apr2021 (at the age of 21-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient denied having any medical condition and confirmed not taking any concomitant medication. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0153), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 17Mar2021 (at the age of 21-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Apr2021, the patient experienced dizziness and felt woozy almost all days, &#34;when I lay down I do get the spins and stuff&#34; and nauseous. The clinical course of the events was as follows: The patient reported, &#34;I have been having dizziness and mild nausea since my second vaccine and I have got my vaccine on the 13Apr2021 and I have started on 14Apr2021 the day after the vaccine and it&#39;s been like a whole month already that I have been feeling like that dizzy and nauseous when I wake up in the morning and when I lay down I do get the spins and stuff, and then during the day as I work and stuff, I have to look up the stuff I get woozy. I have been taking Dramamine 25 mg tablet.&#34; The patient also mentioned that she cannot set an appointment at her doctor&#39;s office since they don&#39;t have appointments for 2 months. She is just calling to get a recommendation on which medication she can take and what she can do. The clinical outcome of the events, dizziness and felt woozy almost all days, &#34;when I lay down I do get the spins and stuff&#34; and nauseous was not resolved.  Follow-up attempts are completed.

My bp dropped extremely low, my chest and throat was tight, it was hard to breathe, my tongue felt weird, I was anxious, could hardly see for a while and it was hard to hear. I was so out of it for a while it was hard to talk. EMTs took me to the hospital. Was released that evening, but had continuing dizziness, body numbness, chest pain etc for several days before it got better.   (Doctor at ER said he couldn?t fully say if it was an allergic reaction because it?s so new he didn?t have that information, but the paperwork I have from the Walgreens RX lists Several of the events I experienced as allergic reactions)

                                                About 10 minutes after the injection I started feeling lightheaded. It did not feel like low blood sugar, but I ate a glucose tablet and drank orange juice. I sat for almost an hour and it was getting worse.  A nurse took my orthostatic vitals and when I stood up  I started to fall. I ended up going to the ER  so I could continue being monitored. My labs came back normal and the ED attending determined it wasn&#39;t an anaphylactic reaction.

It was not responding to water or eye drops which is the first time that has ever happened to me. After several eye drops, I was able to drive to work where I was fine except for the eye pain until 10am. Then I started getting body aches, light-headedness and weakness. On the drive home (40 minutes), I developed a fever and the body aches worsened. If I do not consume liquid continuously, I get very light-headed and weak.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient.  A 22-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose  of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sulfa allergy, depression, and anxiety. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included duloxetine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), citalopram (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 08Jan2021 (at the age of 21-years-old; Lot Number: EK9231) for COVID-19 immunization in the left arm. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines (except the first dose) within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 25Jan2021, hours after the second dose, the patient had severe full body flu like aches, lingering joint pain/some joint, dizziness, exhaustion, and weakness. On 26Jan2021, the patient had soreness at injection sight red and swollen. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events.  The clinical outcomes of the full body flu like aches, lingering joint pain/some joint, dizziness, exhaustion, weakness, and soreness injection sight red and swollen were recovering.

                                                Fever of 102 and dehydration contributed to a syncope collapse early the morning after vaccination (7:15 AM  02/20/21). Just before collapsing, I experienced nausea, dizziness, confusion, weakness, and seeing all black in my field of vision. Emergency Room doctors say it was very likely related to an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer Covid vaccination. Treatment included Tylenol and Ibuprofen, rest, and fluids.

Took ibuprofen in the middle of the first night and it helped a little. Fatigue and some reasonable arm pain and neck stiffness continued for a while. Migraine has continued since the vaccination; it&#39;s been 5 days. I&#39;ve had to take at least 2 Advil every day to help it. Can&#39;t even complete an aerobic workout even with the Advil because my head is shaking so much. I&#39;ve had mild migraines before surrounding my period, but they always disappear when I sleep and aren&#39;t there first thing in the morning like this has been. I feel so bad, I find myself having to keep stop walking during the day when completing a task just to hold my pounding head.  Not sure what to do.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

Was conversing.  Stated she was warm, so got her a cold bottle of water.  Stated she was dizzy so helped her to the floor to lay down.  She had contractions of her hands, which she stated that they were numb.  She recovered from the dizziness, but then had a panic attack.  Her BP was normal, but her heart rate became elevated.  Had her lay down until she felt better, helping to slow her breathing.  After about 40 minutes,p t felt good enough to sit in the recovery area.

Pale, weakness, dizziness, nausea, throwing up continued for two hours after waking up (5am) the day after the shot was given.

                                                I got the usual cold-like symptoms the next day. I took a nap and woke up and felt pretty much fine after that. After the 1st, I started getting waves of dizziness. I would lay on ground and I couldn&#39;t get up. After a couple of days, I could do stuff but would get random waves of dizziness and would have to sit down until it went away. My doctor told me to take Allegra and I just kind of lived with it. It didn&#39;t help with symptoms. It started affecting my work because I&#39;m a CNA and I couldn&#39;t be having dizzy spells at work. I went to ER - on January 10th. They sent me to Hasboro because they were to busy at ER. The nurse said I had Vertigo - and they discharged me with Meclizine while I was in ER and it didn&#39;t help. I called me doctor a couple of days after. She told me to combine the Allegro with the Meclizine and that didn&#39;t help with either. I called my doctor back and she said that there is nothing else I can do because my bloodwork came back normal.  I&#39;m not currently taking anything and I&#39;m still getting random dizzy spells. I have returned to work and so I just have to take breaks at work when it happens.  I got the second vaccine on the 19th of January.

                                                I stayed for 30 mins because after my first shot my arm ended up VERY swollen and I had a rash. So I was okay after the 30 minutes but when I started driving I felt like I was high on strong drugs. Like as if I?d taken an extremely strong marajuana edible and it just hit me. I had to pull over because my eyes wouldn?t stay open, my whole body was feeling very heavy and I was extremely tired and out of it. I didn?t have another way to get home (I had traveled about an hour) so I just kept driving and taking 15 min rests along the way. When I got home I fell asleep as soon as I sat down and slept for about four hours. I feel better now that I?m awake, still light headed but not near as bad.

                                                I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at 9:15 AM on March 9, 2021.  I then returned to work. At about 4:30 PM on that same day, I started feeling dizzy. I felt like I was going to faint at work. Every time I would stand up, I would feel like I was going to pass out.  I had someone drive me home because I felt that I was too dizzy to drive. I arrived home at 6:00 PM and began to vomit profusely. I threw up all night and had the chills.  In the morning, I felt better but still had a dizzy feeling. The dizziness and vomiting completely  subsided by March 11,  2021.    On March  12, 2021, I noticed that I had floating black spots in my left eye accompanied by a painful migraine. I have never had eye floaters or migraines previous to this vaccine. My migraine lasted for 5 days straight and I had to be off work to go to the emergency  room because I started to loose vision in my left eye. They were unsure of the cause because I did not have any pre-existing health conditions.  The migraine finally subsided after the 7th day. I have had eye floaters every since I got the vaccine. I?ve been to an eye doctor and my primary and they all have told me that it could be from this vaccine because I have never had the problem until I received it.

                                                Recipient received the vaccine and was waiting in the observation area.  Around 10 minutes, felt hot and dizzy and then lost consciousness for less than 10 seconds. She did not fall on the floor.  Moved her to the cot and called emergency responders. She said she had not eaten anything that day nor had any water. Gave her water and a granola bar. EMS evaluated her and she wanted to go to the ED for further evaluation.

Felt very restless and sick during night, by the next morning symptoms really sat in.  March 24, 2021: Went to Urgent Care due to fever. Had COVID-19 test (negative). Very close to passing out there (put head between knees and did not). Was sent to emergency room immediately due to heart rate (high 140s-150s. Highest known was 152 BPM). ER performed following: portable chest x-ray, blood tests, urine tests, EKG. Was told results were all normal with the exception of EKG (not told anything about it, form listed as abnormal). Passed out 2x at hospital. Was given one IV rehydration solution and released that night. Symptoms below lasted for several days: Headache Aches Nausea Aggressive shakes Shortness of breath Confusion Dizziness Site pain (also developed bump under arm) Fever - 103.8 (after 2 Advil, 2 Tylenol, 3 ice packs and eating frozen grapes) Heavy sweats Racing heart Restless  March 30, 2021: Still having frequent heart palpitations (they come and go but happen several times during the day. Keep having very high heart rates). Went to doctor. While there, nurse noted irregular heartbeat that sounded like it was ?skipping a beat? and heart rate was also jumping all over the place (high pace, low pace, high, etc.). It was clear something was abnormal. Doctor gave EKG approximately 20 minutes later, EKG looked normal. Was told to come back next morning for blood work and to cut out caffeine.  March 31, 2021: Came in for blood work to check thyroid.  April 6, 2021: Thyroid results were normal. Still having palpitations among other symptoms (see April 12 for more info) so was told to come in. Was given ?work from home? note and referred to cardiologist.  April 12, 2021: Appointment at cardiologist. Still having severe palpitations, occasional dizziness/ lightheadedness, nausea, shortness of breath, exhaustion and chest pain. Heart rate was recorded this day to have gotten up to 139 BPM-- was very high majority of the day. EKG was normal (with exception of high heart rate) but 30 mins later doctor observed high heart rate and abnormal rhythm. Was told to come back in a week and one day for a heart ultrasound and heart monitoring for three days. Still no caffeine intake since 3/30/21. Previous heart rates taken at doctor&#39;s visits over the years for comparison below. Never had any prior heart problems whatsoever:  8/29/18: 70 BPM 9/17/18: 88 BPM 10/17/18: 64 BPM 10/31/18: 73 BPM 1/21/19: 78 BPM Note: At this point, I have missed over a  week and a half of work, and worked from home for over a week. I&#39;m not any better heart wise at all over the course of three weeks post vaccine.

Hives and red rash on face, right arm, back, scalp, lips, inner lips/gum line, and back. Rash got worse the day after the second dose and caused an itchiness/ tightness of the chest and throat. Did not feel like my life was threatened so I nursed it at home with antihistamine.

I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

Approximately 10 minutes after administration, an allergic reaction began while I was driving alone in my car. Most notably my blood pressure dropped suddenly, causing me to almost pass out. I stopped driving and my symptoms worsened. Symptoms included shaking, sweating, nausea, confusion, rapid heart rate, red blotchy face, slightly labored breathing, itching and slight swelling of my tongue and lips, anxiety. I could still breathe, so I did not seek treatment, but sat in the parking lot of a medical building for at least an hour for symptoms to subside. Symptoms were acute for about 45 minutes and gradually decreased over four hours. The rest of the day and the next day I felt extremely weak. The following six weeks I continued to have swollen, dry, painful lips every single day and a very itchy rash on my hands and wrists. Occasionally I would wake up with swelling around my eyes. I also had an unusual reaction after eating a salad where my lips swelled even more and became numb, along with an itchy mouth. These long lasting symptoms did not go away until I got a steroid cream from a dermatologist, who denied that my reactions were from the vaccine after talking to me for only five minutes. I just believe that there are many more cases of reactions to the vaccines that have not been reported.

                                                Pain in my joints and muscles started later that night after having the vaccine administered. When I woke up the next morning my whole body hurt so bad I could barely move. Over the next few days I felt better in some ways but my joints and muscles still hurt and they never have before. I am still feeling aches . I did not go see anyone as I do not have insurance.

                                                Since my second dose, I&#39;ve been experiencing migraines, shortness of breath, and an extremely increased heart rate. While attending my routine cycle class (been attending about 3 times a week for several months) I nearly passed out which is extremely unusual. I have also been experiencing a much lighter than usual menstrual cycle. A few days following my vaccination I was also experiencing pain in my left lung (this has since subsided).

                                                Patient received the 1st COVID vaccine (Pfizer, Lot #: EW0173, and expiration date: 08/2021) at 2:55 PM. Patient received the vaccine while sitting in the zero gravity chair, due to a history of feeling lightheaded and passing out with needles. After a few minutes in the zero gravity chair, patient expressed that she was feeling good and wanted to sit in the observation area next to her boyfriend. She got up and walked to another chair without assistance and with a steady gait.  EMT made contact with the patient at 3:12 PM, while she was sitting in the observation area. Patient was conscious, alert, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation but complained of &#34;lightheadedness.&#34; EMT grabbed a wheelchair and patient was then transferred to wheelchair, without assistance. At 3:15 PM, baseline vital signs were taken, while patient was sitting: blood pressure: 136/82, heart rate: 108, respiratory rate: 18. Skin was cold, dry, and normal for ethnicity. Patient claimed to have anxiety and explained that fainting and lightheadedness was &#34;common&#34; for her after receiving a shot. Patient denied taking any medications or having any allergies. A second set of vital signs were taken at 3:20 PM: blood pressure: 136/86, heart rate: 108, respiratory rate: 18. Skin was moist, warm, and normal for ethnicity. Patient was negative for orthostatic pressures. EMT advised patient to stay an additional 30 minutes for further observation. Around 3:50 PM, patient was asked how she was feeling and she stated &#34;good.&#34; EMT educated the client on what to do if additional signs and symptoms developed and when to contact her provider. EMT also explained the use of V- safe to the patient. Patient then left the vaccination site, unassisted and with a steady gait.

After leaving the vaccination room the patient sat in a chair and felt fine and was talking on the phone, around 1:05, her sister alerted us that she thought she was passing out and was talking to her trying to keep her awake. I grabbed smelling salts and when I got to the patient, she was hard to wake up so I used the smelling salts on her and she came to. Gave water and juice to patient and moved her into the vaccination room to give her space to recover. She complained of being dizzy and ears ringing, we monitored her for 30 more minutes and all symptoms had resolved. Did not seek further treatment.

It got much wore the next day. She also experienced some dizziness and pre-syncope. EMS was dispatched but did not transport her. Her O2 sat, blood pressure, pulse and temperature were all normal. She then went to a walk in clinic later that day and they told her she had a panic attack. She was still having the shortness of breath and chest tightness. She used her Pro-air and it helped somewhat.

Three days later my syncope from my heart condition has increased. Now I have been fainting several times a day (usually it?s just once a day or once every other day). A week after the vaccine a red spot about the size of a quarter appeared on my right wrist and then went away 12 hours later. The other symptoms didn?t improve. Then when I got the second vaccine my symptoms worsened. My nausea, lethargy, body aches and diarrhea have gotten worse and now I?m fainting even more often then I was after the first vaccine. I also feel lightheaded all day everyday. 4 days after the second vaccine a second red spot appeared on my left hand (this time about the size of a pea). It also went away 12 hours later like the first spot did. Now I am on my 5th day after the second vaccine and my symptoms still haven?t improved.

                                                April 25th (within 24 hours of vaccine) I felt the typical fever, severe chills, fatigue, etc that I&#39;d often reported. No soreness. This was gone by the end of the day. April 26th I began feeling some light-headedness and feeling faint. My heart was fluttering every time I stood up, my vision went blurry, and I was very unstable (had to hold something to keep from falling). This feeling was bad enough to cause me to become uncoordinated and fall down the stairs while home alone. That evening I went to the ER where they verified that I was &#34;stable&#34; and checked for bigger issues, and sent me home without treatment.  These symptoms continued for the next week. Improving a little each day.  It is now May 10th and I am still experiencing some light headedness and clumsiness. Still needing to rebalance myself on something if I stand up quickly. At some point over this time, I&#39;ve started making mistakes in my words and sentences. Just odd things like omitting words from phrases or confusing &#34;up&#34; with &#34;over&#34; etc. I did not notice this at first, but my co-workers did. Before the vaccine, this is not something I ever did. Correlation?  Causation?  Regardless, I&#39;m still a little unwell and a little worried. But the ER seemed unconcerned, so I&#39;ve been continuing about my life.

                                                Throat closing; Shortness of breath; Swollen throat; Dizziness/ Lightheaded; Wheezing; Allergic reaction; had a combination of allergies specially to PEG in the vaccine; This is spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 22-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, LOT number: EW0151, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 04Apr2021 07:30 AM (reported as 06:30 or 07:30, probably 07:30) at age of 22-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) from Jan2021 and gastro stuff. Patient was previously diagnosed with tachycardia, but this was a misdiagnosis. She had a cardiac implant, but they couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong, so her daughter saw a new cardio, and she has been good. Patient was previously had a reaction to Miralax. Concomitant medications included metoprolol tartrate which was taken for several years for POTS, lorazepam (ATIVAN) for panic attacks (started taking 2-3 years ago, maybe 1.5 years ago, when she went off to college, caller clarified it was 2 years ago), escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) for panic disorder and anxiety (started about two years ago and was off for about a month). There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Caller stated the patient had a reaction to the first shot of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She had a severe reaction. Patient had a combination of allergies specially to PEG in the vaccine. Patient spent the entire day in urgent care. She had a swollen throat and dizziness right after receiving the vaccine (04Apr2021). She was wheezing and lightheaded. Patient was given an ep-pen and Benadryl. It took a while to bring it down. Patient had Pfizer&#39;s COVID 19 vaccine on 04APR2021, and had an immediate allergic reaction including throat closing, wheezing, shortness of breath, dizziness, with the first shot, so caller needed to call to report it, caller&#39;s cousin is a pharmacist, and said to call. Patient was not taken to the hospital, caller ended up taking the patient to urgent care, they had talked patient out of it, and the doctor was livid, patient&#39;s doctor was working at the site that morning. Caller stated she is a busy worker, and today is the first day she is getting to this, and getting things squared away. She knew her daughter has a 60-day window to decide if she was going to get the second, and she wanted to get it, but the reaction was horrible, it was in her daughter&#39;s best interest, they were talking at the hospital, and caller needed to talk to someone to figure it out. Patient&#39;s doctor didn&#39;t know. Caller&#39;s cousin is a pharmacist and talked to them and said, because caller stated her daughter had had a reaction to Miralax, too and her cousin said that has PEG, which her cousin said was what Moderna and Pfizer have, so caller didn&#39;t know. Her daughter ended up going to urgent care, stayed there, and was calmer, her vitals settled after the Epi Pen, and caller understood it is the protocol with Epi Pen, that she has to be monitored medically, so patient was monitored at Urgent Care until 1PM, and her daughter was like, it wore her out, so that was the response. Her daughter has recovered completely, but it took a few days, to go back to herself, patient has a cardiac condition, POTS, and gastro stuff, and caller was trying to get her medical stuff squared away, and this definitely didn&#39;t help. Caller stated they would be trying to wean her daughter off Metoprolol. caller stated it&#39;s Ivabradine, but her daughter has not started it yet, since it has side effects with vision, so her daughter was waiting to go to the eye doctor to take that, so she was taking Metoprolol. Lexapro was stopped trying to get ready for this heart medicine, so they were waiting to figure out all this, before they start that. No further details provided. Caller read from paperwork, which said allergic reaction NOS, drug reaction allergic. Then there was cardio stuff, then it said Cardiac monitoring, oximetry, CBC with automated differential; Hcg beta qualitative urine, IV saline lock. When asked for results, caller said she saw results, but that must be where it&#39;s connected with another hospital. Stated she can fax the results. It was reported that patient had a follow up at doctor&#39;s office for the events. Event throat closing was reported as serious as medically significant. Onset date of the events was 04Apr2021. Outcome of the events was recovered.  Report 1 of 2. Caller was provided with phone number and hours of operation prior to cold transfer onto the line, due to a high call volume, to wait for the next available agent.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Within 2 minutes of receiving her first Pfizer dose, she stated she felt as though she was going to pass out. I immediately headed out to the waiting room where she was sitting post-vaccination and patient then slumped over and lost consciousness. She regained consciousness within 10 seconds. During her period of unconsciousness, she seemed to shake and tremor a bit, almost as though she was seizing . Her eyes were open the whole time she was unconscious. When she regained consciousness, she knew where she was, why she was here and refused emergency medical services to be called. She complained of being hot and nauseous. I gave her water and an ice pack. I monitored her blood pressure. Her blood pressure was slightly elevated, but came back down to normal before leaving  the pharmacy. She was brought home by a family member around 6:00 pm after stating she felt much better.

I called her the next day but she didn&#39;t answer but I left her a message . I also recommended the she would check with her md on the next day.

The vomiting,  being dizzy and sleeping continued for days.  Went to Urgent Care on April 20, 2021.  They gave me nausea medicine and said I should expect to feel this way for about one week.  The nausea medicine helped with the vomiting, but did not help with being dizzy and sleepy.  Making a trip to the ER for more answers.

She might have passed out for a few seconds because her head was leaning on one side, upon asking her if she was ok, she did respond and complained of feeling dizzy and loss of hearing. After giving water to her, she started feeling better, her hearing came back but she still felt a little light headed and dizzy. We still monitored her and mom was called to pick her up. She was doing lot better after few minutes. Mom came to pick her up and we explained what happened to her to mom.

I would suddenly feel like I wasn&#39;t getting enough oxygen even though I was breathing deeply and then need to lie down so I didn&#39;t pass out. This happened about 4 times per day lasting about 20 minutes each episode. Not exercising or doing anything out of the ordinary at time of onset. I haven&#39;t noticed these symptoms today, so it might be over.

                                                I have been feeling very lightheaded and dizzy ever since. This occurs every day.  I cannot drink caffeine anymore because I get extra dizzy. My balance is off. I got my heart checked in which I had to wear a heart monitor and get an echo. It came back and nothing is wrong with my heart. I also cannot take a deep breath. I always have shortness of breath. I had three episodes in which I thought I was actually going to pass out and my arms and legs were tingly and I was nauseated. I went to the emergency room and nothing came back from my labs. I am lightheaded when I get up fast. I no longer have nausea and appendages tingle.  All of this occurred on the first dose and I did not receive the second dose.

                                                Started experiencing dizziness on the day of the second dose (4/30/21). Dizziness continued for 2 weeks and then stopped for a week and came back and have been experiencing it for almost 2 months now. Have gone to 7 doctor visits including an opthemologist, the emergency room twice and my primary care physician and a walk in clinic. I have been prescribed servers medications which do not alleviate the symptoms including meclazine, hydroxaline, scopolamine, amoxicillin, prednisone, Valium, and reglin (for headache). About 3 weeks after getting the second dose I began experiencing headaches so I went for a CT scan in the ER on 5/24 which came back normal. I returned to the ER on 2/27 with blurry vision and was sent for an MRI on my brain and neck which also came back normal. I have upcoming appointments with a neurologist and an ENT next month. I have also been experiencing muscle aches for the past 3 days specifically in my joints, my arms, and legs. I have also had headaches that feel like my head it being sliced or stabbed on the right side.

This was 3 months ago and I&#39;m still experiencing heart palpitations daily. I can&#39;t exert myself, carry heavy things, walk long distances, or be in heat without feeling as though my heart is swollen/racing/palpitating. I went to the cardiologist and told her my symptoms and she said it is likely myocarditis.

                                                About 3 days later, I started noticing shortness of breath. Mine had just caused really bad allergies. I thought it was just my allergies causing the shortness of breath. After my allergies stopped for the season, I was still having shortness of breath. About a week or two after getting my vaccine I started noticing that my dizzy spells started getting worse. I was having light headedness. I was having these beforehand, but after the vaccine they were worse. I would normally just get a little head rush (like standing up too fast), but now my vision starts getting black from the outside coming in. I almost pass out. After about 3-5 seconds, I&#39;m able to gather myself and keep myself from passing out. I also noticed that my heart cannot take as much strain as it used to. I was having palpitations. It feels like it&#39;s attempting to stop beating. It now is triggered more easily. It&#39;s very hard for me to catch my breath and I get worn out super easily. I went and saw my PCP about 2 weeks ago for a regular routine visit and I informed her about my symptoms. She said everything looked fine and in normal ranges. They sent records to a pap specialist. I am still waiting to hear back from them to do some testing. I also talked with my therapist about some of the issues I&#39;ve had because we thought it might be anxiety related, but we ruled that out. It is more medical.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height.

                                                Approximately 1 hour after receiving the  vaccine I developed tachycardia  that ranged between 130 and 95, this lasted from  01/08/2021 until 01/09 ~10 AM.  On 01/08  ~5 PM I began to develop  a fever that reached a peak of 102.4 at 4am (01/09), despite taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours. Last fever recorded 01/09 ~9PM of 99.5 (while still taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours).  Additional symptoms have been severe nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, bilateral lower back pain with some mild bruising to the kidney region, difficulty breathing,  chest pressure, shortness of breath along with a cough upon exertion (developed ~6 PM 01/08), which is still present today (01/10 1:25 PM), and an erythematous rash that covers the anterior side of the right forearm, from wrist to elbow (first noticed on 01/10 ~11 AM).

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after the vaccination the patient reported dizziness and possible rash on her upper chest. It was difficult to assess if the rash was truly a rash or it was simply skin lesions that were already present (patient claimed she did not know). It did not resemble a maculopapular rash. It marginally resembled minor hives/urticaria. Patient did not report any localized symptoms at injection site. Patient was informed to remain seated and that her vitals would be taken and she would be further observed. Then about 10 minutes after this (25 minutes after vaccination), patient reported difficulty breathing. Facial redness was noted at this point and patient&#39;s breathing sounded difficult. Emergency medical services were called and EpiPen was administered at this point. Patient began to tremble and pace of breathing increased. Emergency medical technicians arrived, took vitals / EKG, and assessed the patient. EMT assessment did not reveal urticaria. EMT instructed patient to control her breathing. The EMTs believe that it may not have been a true reaction but rather the patient may have been suffering from an anxiety attack. Patient was then taken to local ER for further evaluation.

I took my temperature at 6:00 pm on 1/20 and it read 99.7. I then took tylenol and at 8:30, I took my temperature again and it was 100.5. My normal temperature is 97.2-97.5. I took an ice bath at this point as my arm at the injection site was extremely swollen, hard, and hot to the touch. I called urgent care to see what medications I could take in addition to tylenol and they recommended motrin to bring down my fever. I woke up several times through the night and took medication. At around 8 am on 1/21, I took my temperature and it was 97.8.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

I fainted about 15 minutes after sitting down in the waiting area and upon fainting hit my head on the floor. I regained consciousness while laying on the floor getting my vitals taken by staff. Because of the minor head injury and proximity to getting the vaccine, I accepted being taken to the ER.

                                                On 2/10/2021, two days after my 2nd dose, I started experiencing mild abdominal pain at around 10am. I knew it was a side effect from the vaccine for I had been experiencing severe chills, fever, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and nausea the day before (2/9/2021) and those symptoms except for the fever had subsided on the 10th. I had been unable to eat all day on the 10th due to the pain but it was manageable. At 2pm the abdominal pain got worse. At 4:30pm the pain became unmanageable and I could not walk erect without severe pain. I was crying and bend over trying to walk. I had a family member drive me to the ER and arrived at around 4:40pm.  Lying down with my knees up seemed to help the pain a bit but was exacerbated when lying flat or ambulating. I was given Pepcid, zofran,  and toradol all IV push  at 8pm and the pain subsided within 15 minutes. Today I still have mild abdominal pain but I would rate it at a 1/10.

                                                A few hours after  receiving my second dose of the COVID vaccine, I was extremely fatigued. I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                After receiving vaccine at 3 pm I started to have anxiety and my heart rate went up. This was presumably because I also have a needle phobia but I did almost faint and had to have on site EMT asses condition and observe for 30 minutes. At 4 pm one hour after injection face felt itchy and irritated and noticed hives on neck and jawline. Immediately administered benadryl 50 mg which made the hives subside.

Patient received vaccine and about one minute later the patient passed out and fell forward. I was able to catch her and lower to the ground safely. I called for pharmacist on duty to assist in the care of the patient. Less than a minute after the patient passed out she was awake and alert.  The patient was asked multiple times if she needed to go to the hospital and asked if she was okay to drive home.  She insisted that she faints frequently from vaccines and denied any further care.  She stayed in the waiting area while being checked on several times. The patient left after she said she was &#34;100% good.&#34; She thanked us for taking care of her and apologized for what happened.

She commented that her vision was &#34;getting black&#34; I noted that her pupils were dilated and that her heart rate was 50 beats per minute. She was quite diaphoretic. No loss of consciousness.  She noted that she had not eaten for several hours prior to vaccine administration.  Patient was given water to drink and a bottle of fruit flavored tea.  After consuming fluids, she began to regain her usual skin tone and reported &#34;feeling better, but not quite right&#34;.  She was observed for an additional 20 minutes and offered crackers to eat.  She called a friend to come pick her up and drive her home.  She left the clinic ambulatory accompanied by friend.

                                                The second the person gave me the shot my index finger went numb, stiff and my range of motion decreased.  Within less than 24 hours day my whole hand and lower arm were stiff, numb,  painful, and tingling. I also have overall weakness and doing basic tasks like writing essays for school has become painful and difficult. My hand is stiff and looks like a claw. While it has gotten a little better after taking medications that my doctor prescribed my fingers are still weak stiff, numb, tingling, and painful.  The vaccine was administered too far up and too far to the left which has most likely caused nerve damage.  There is also a small bruise at the injection site and the injection is still visible 5&#43; days later. This could have been prevented through better training of health officials working at state-run vaccine sites. I hope this hasn&#39;t caused lasting damage.

                                                i received the vaccine at 3pm on monday april 12th. i started shaking less than 5 minutes after i received the dose and my throat started to swell and i couldn?t swallow. they placed me under observation for 30 minutes and gave me water?saying that ?i might just be afraid of the needle and not to worry, this is an abnormally normal reaction to a new vaccine.? after 30 minutes a man walked over to me and said ?oh you?re still here?? and chuckled. they then told me i would be fine after a while and to leave. i started walking down the sidewalk and almost passed out so i called an uber to take me to the nearest urgent care. i arrived at urgent care around 4pm unable to swallow and having a reaction to the vaccine. they saw me immediately and gave me 3 50mg of prednisone and a benadryl and placed me under observation for 45 minutes. he said i looked better and i even felt marginally better. i called another uber and when i was almost home my tongue started to go numb as well as my lips and my breathing was becoming constricted. i had the uber driver pull over as i had to sit on the sidewalk and get some air. i then called another uber to the hospital because my symptoms were becoming increasingly more alarming. Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

                                                Immediately after injection, started getting black spots in vision. I was able to drive through the cones to the waiting area but the black spots were getting worse to the point where I could barely see. My ears also felt numb and I could barely hear anything. I got to the waiting area (drive-thru clinic) and they weren&#39;t making people wait the 15 min so I told them I could barely see and couldn&#39;t drive. I was attended to by medical personnel. My vision was almost completely full of black spots, slurry speech, I felt very sweaty and very weak. As I was being attended to, the only thing that helped was reclining my seat and closing my eyes with the A/C on. After about 20 min my vision was improving and my friend picked me up from the site. I proceeded to lay down and drink lots of gatorade and felt more normal in a few hours to the point of being able to drive home. I continued to feel weak and fatigued for the rest of the day. The next day I had very bad arm pain, but it seemed normal compared to other vaccines I&#39;ve received. The third day (today) I have a massive headache all day that is not improving from tylenol and seems very different than the average dehydration headache. Not sure if that&#39;s related to the vaccine but seems possible.

I  got patient ice pack and some chocolate(she said she wasn&#39;t diabetic or allergic to chocolate), got 2 pillows from the back of the store to lay her down but she wanted to sit in the big chair with arm rests on it;  mom got her a water, after 15 more minutes patient felt much better &amp; asked to leave. We verified that she felt fine &amp; she did not want a wheelchair. Mom did mention that patient does regularly pass out in stores(without  giving blood or getting shots). I recommended that she see a doctor about that issue because their could  be something more serious going on with her body.

Received 2nd covid vaccination last week- mild reaction with fever thereafter.  She had w/u in the ED including an EKG with inferior and septal TWI and trop of 1.61.  CTA chest was negative.  She was admitted.  After admit, troponin trended up (1.61--3.71--4.93).  CRP 49.1, ESR 21.   Echo showed apex hypokinesis so with TWI on EKG and elevated trop, cardiology elected for LHC.  This was normal.  Cardiac MRI showed myopericarditis. She was started on high dose ASA, colchicine and bblocker for this.  Likely viral etiology (Covid, Resp 4 plex negative).  Trop trended down on 4/13 (CRP still rising).  Cardiology was ok with discharge.  Will need 2 weeks of ASA and 3 months of colchicine.  No strenuous activities for that time frame.  She is getting her Masters in music/violin and did not need a return to school note.   Feeling somewhat better at discharge- rated pain 6/10.    Internal Medicine followup in 1 week Cardiology followup in 2 months

It felt like things were moving in slow motion, frame by frame, when I woke up at 3am. Was light headed, couldn&#39;t stand, chills and shaking. I vomited from 3-4 am and then again at 8am when I woke up, with my visual disturbances limited to the 3-4am hours. I took Advil and was able to go back to sleep for most of the day, sleeping from around 9am to 1pm. Nausea, fever, and vomiting have all have cleared. Now I just have a headache and muscle aches, especially near the injection site. Almost 24 hrs after my vaccine now and I feel drastically better than I did overnight.

My tech and I observed her closely, and she began to complain of dizziness and feeling hot about 5 minutes after receiving vaccine.  I sat with her, gave her water and candy.  She then told me her dizziness was getting worse and asked to lie down.  I took her pulse which was WNL..  She also had some Gatorade.  We called paramedics as a precaution.  They assessed her and she continued to improve.  She was able to sit in a chair and felt fine after 5 more minutes.  She left pharmacy.

There has been no injury or stress on the joint. But it has swollen and appears to be experiencing an RA flare up.

                                                The day following the vaccination I woke up with severe arm pain 2 inches down from the injection site. My arm had swollen about 3 inches in diameter. It was so painful that I could not roll over, I could not lift my arm, and I was in inconsolable tears. It was a deep stinging pain, as though I was repeatedly being stung by a hornet. My left hand was going numb off and on. I went to the doctor because I was incapable of lifting my arm, and the doctor identified that my lymph nodes and my left ear were swollen and enlarged. He recommended ibuprofen and ice for the lump. The second day after receiving the vaccine I had a mild headache, and my arm was only slightly swollen. The third day after receiving the vaccine my arm was still slightly swollen and sore, but the pain was manageable without pain medication. The fourth day after receiving the vaccine I woke up with a deep cough and dizzy spells lasting throughout the day.

Arm was sore and unable to move for 3 whole days starting immediately after shot. Second vaccine: felt great for about 12 hours after. No side effects at all. Ran errands and all. Next morning at 6 am, woke up with extreme body aches, fever, pain, headache, light sensitivity, can&#39;t keep any food down, vomiting, nausea upon standing and my left arm is so incredibly sore I can&#39;t even touch it. About 24 hours after second dose, I still feel the same symptoms. Awful pain all over (from toes to groin to shoulders) and a bad tension headache that won&#39;t go away, even with Tylenol.

                                                INTERIM HISTORY (04/02/2021). 1st dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on April 2, 2021. Urticaria then flared 11 days following vaccine . Developed more hives during the day. Severe hives and lip swelling then occurred 2 weeks following vaccine. Hives associated with a lot of flushing and were very uncomfortable, burning. Hives did not respond to benadryl or benadryl spray like they usually do. Sunday April 18th patient fainted two times One time she fell, another time she sat down in a chair. Went to ED on Monday April 19th 2021. Driving home from a friends house when skin became very itchy. Then broke out in hives covering entire body. Hives started in trunk and spread to neck/extremities. She later noticed GI issues and then eventually trouble breathing.  ED history noted c/o tongue swelling, throat tightness, chest pain and shortness of breath.  This was her worst reaction to date since starting her current medication regimen. Called friend to watch her dog and went to ER when she developed trouble breathing.  She did not want to use epi pen if she did not absolutely need to use it. They did not end up giving her epi in the ER per her request. She was given IV pepcid and fluids; tryptase level was drawn.  Symptoms improved with treatment.  Next day she had transient hives but no hives since.  Still with some intermittent flushing.  Over the last few days she has noticed more uncomfortable flushing of her face . Not something that happens normally. She is not sure if she should get the 2nd COVID vaccine but would feel better if she had both.  She had COVID infection in March 2020. She was symptomatic but did not require hospitalization. Rapid antibody test negative in July 2020 at urgent care center in LI.

A 23-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP 6955), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 16Mar2021 at 02:30 PM (at the age of 23 years), as a single first dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was allergic to Penicillin, Sulfa drugs, Cefalexin, walnuts and pecans. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included Zoloft (Sertraline) and Estarylla (Ethinyl Estradiol and Norgestimate). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. On 16Mar2021 at 02:45 PM (directly following the vaccination), the patient experienced light headedness, and she thought it was mostly anxiety/mental related and not vaccine related as she was nervous; fully recovered after 10 minutes or deep breaths and drinking Gatorade. Four hours later, she experienced sore arm. Therapeutic measures taken for the adverse events was unknown. The clinical outcome of events lightheaded, anxiety/mental related, nervous were fully recovered, and sore arm was not recovered at the time of reporting. No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I haven?t not received the second dose because I?m too scared I will completely lose feeling in my body and it will never returner I will develop Guillian-Barre syndrome as a result.

When doing the Covid injection screening in her chart, she did mention that she had some itchiness and a rash after the first injection. I had FNP assess her and clear her to have the injection. Pt was cleared and vaccination was given. Pt stated she didnt even feel the injection and looked well. I told her to wait the allotted 15 mins and left the door open. I told her that if she felt anything coming on, to say something,  as we had staff in ear shot. Pt understood. By the time I was finished giving the next 2 injections to the next 2 Pt&#39;s on the schedule, 2 staff members were holding and supporting Pt because she was not able to hold herself up. Pt was no responsive in the physical sense but when I asked her if she was scared, she started to cry. Which  indicated to us that she could hear us and understood. BS was low at 79. Juice was given. She was able to take small sips when strongly encouraged.  BP was 148/78 at one point but eventually leveled out. Pulse was around 120 but then lowered. We had tried to cool her down with a cool pack, as she was sweating. Temp was  normal at 98.2 degrees. AED was obtained and  911 was called. I told Pt that I had called her emergency contact/Husband of what had happened and to meet her at  Hospital. Her husband didnt sounds distressed on the phone. Pt was taken by ambulance with all of her belongings. the Supervisor was informed of the situation and agreed to call Pt on Monday to do a wellness phone check.

PM starting having extreme itching on dorsal sides of hands, used lotion that I normally use (sensitive skin kind) to see if it was just dryness. Red bumps still on just right hand 1/9/2021 woke up in middle of night to extreme itching and spreading red bumps on both hands. Bumps are small and fluid filled. Took Benadryl and went back to bed after washing hands. Early PM continued extreme itching and spreading bumps to wrists becoming more red and some bumps popping. Later in evening I noticed swelling starting in my hands. I have tried Benadryl cream (not difference) washing hands well (no difference) lotion (worse) hydrocortisone 1% cream (itching worse) swelling went from none to a non pitting edema. Hands hurt and swelling increasing over time more bumps showing up on hands (with no other changes to any products I have used)

Slept for 10-12 hours. Woke up fine, had no issues or symptoms. Later on as the day progressed, around noon-1pm, I noticed I had started to get a headache and some dizziness. Daily headaches and vertigo are normal for me, currently seeing a neurologist for this, but I realized that this was getting worse from the daily headaches and vertigo that affects me. Took 2 Excedrin extra strength migraine relief to no relief.

                                                In addition to arm pain for two days, I also had chest pains/tightness. I felt the chest tightness the morning after getting the vaccine. The chest tightness continued until 1/23.  It was not a constant pain, but sometimes when I would move a certain way, my chest would hurt. The spot that hurt is right in the middle of my chest. It got worse when I would exercise and breathe heavily. The chest pain continued to stop and come back for several weeks. The night after I received the vaccine, I felt dizzy and felt as if I would pass out, but did not. This only happened one time and was better when I woke up the next morning.   The weekend after I got the vaccine, I was worried I might have covid, so I got tested for covid, but the results came back negative.

I also experienced muscle soreness and chills. After taking Tylenol, the symptoms subsided. Around 3:15am on 1/23/2021, I woke up with a 101.2 degree fever along with more intense muscle soreness, chills, and light-headedness. I felt slightly nauseous and had a headache. I took Tylenol again to lower the fever. When I woke up around 8:00am, the symptoms were gone except for lingering fatigue.

When I got home the body aches got worse and I started getting severe chills and could not stop shaking. That night was difficult to sleep because of the pain I was in. When I woke up the next day, 01/30/2021, I was dizzy, severe fatigue, had severe migraines, I could not breathe when standing up and moving around, my heart was racing, and it felt like I had a sun burn all over my body. I called the nursing coordinator for that day and asked what to do and she said to go to the ER. When I arrived at the ER, they said I had 100 degree temp., I was tacky. They gave me medicine for the pain and the doctor said I was having a adverse reaction to the vaccine but by the next day I would feel better. I went home and slept after the ER all day and night and by Sunday 01/31/2021, I was feeling better after excedrine and advil

Increasingly getting fatigue and wasn&#39;t able to keep my head up for more than 30sec with out it falling. By 5p I could not move left arm at all and called PCP office and went to ER. Over 5 hours I got  feeling back in left arm and left ER at 10:30p. CT was done to rule out stroke or other injury. Next day around 2p my right arm started to get more numb and I wasn&#39;t able to move it much. SOB and throat tightening came back briefly. Later that day lumbar puncture done to rule out guillain barre syndrome. Numbness is not as severe now 2/3 and each day since 1/28 it gets increasingly less

                                                I got my Pfizer first dose today and it was fine at first, but four hours later I was slammed with incredible arm and shoulder pain. I have a really high pain tolerance (tore my meniscus 3x with no surgery or pain meds, wasn&#39;t too bad) and I&#39;m 24F, not on any medications. I keep reading that sore arms are common, but this is a 6/7 on the pain scale. Putting on joggers was excruciating and I almost vomited. I can&#39;t even bring a glass to my mouth with that arm. Even laying as still as possible hurts. I cannot lift my arm past my pelvis and my shoulder is immobile. I feel nauseous when I move it.  I haven&#39;t seen this experience anywhere so I am puzzled... I&#39;m fully vaccinated w/ everything else and the closest to this was the tetanus shot, which hurt but not like - this - level of pain. I&#39;m getting a bit concerned that the person who did it (in a hundred car drive thru) missed the deltoid and shot it into my shoulder?? It&#39;s VERY high on my arm. I believe in this vax 100% but I can&#39;t believe the pain I&#39;m having and why it&#39;s not mentioned anywhere.  Like I am so so grateful for this vax and am in awe of the science -- and everyone should get it   -- but I just don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m in literal excruciating pain :( Moving it even slightly feel like I&#39;m ripping it from the bone.   It?s now been 20 hours and the pain is worse than ever, even breathing, sneezing or bending over causes searing pain.

                                                Anaphylaxis - Throat swelled almost completely closed, wheezing, lightheadedness (nearly passed out), throat/neck and injection site were very itchy and swollen, face/eyes swelled up, turned very pale all over, heart palpitations, etc. The next day - severe, horribly painful burning sensation all throughout my body.  Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I suspect fever was between 102 and 103 between 1:45 am and 4 am, however, as I did not feel well enough to find thermometer to take temperature until later on once fever had broken. Had 3 cycles of sweating and shivering between 1:45 am and 4 am. Lingering headache and body aches until 3 pm, fatigue and sore neck on side of vaccination (left) lasting rest of 3/12. All symptoms resolved morning of 3/13.

                                                At 11:00pm on 03/23/2021 I started to feel sore from my shoulders to my knees. I also have a headache that is not relieved with ibuprofen or Tylenol. The sore muscles make it hard to walk. I did not develop a low grade fever, but I did have a few hot flashes. I?m more fatigued than normal and haven?t been sleeping well at night since the last dose of the vaccine.

After about 36 hours it had resolved itself. strange feeling that I can best describe as &#34;trippy&#34; - lasted from about two hours after the vaccine until I went to bed that night - The cheese I ate with dinner tasted abnormally strong, I kept feeling like everything around me was moving even though it wasn&#39;t (felt like the floor / walls were moving - similar to when I&#39;m super tired and / or severely jet lagged), and somehow colors seemed a little off.  When I woke up the next morning this &#34;trippy&#34; feeling was gone.

I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

He left to get water. Another RPH saw pt. falling over in her chair. Patient&#39;s eye were open and tears were coming down but she could not speak. Her eyes began to close and she kept trying to pass out. We took pts mask off and fanned her and kept talking to her. After about 3 minutes, she was able to focus her eyes and could say her name. After about 3 more minutes, she was able to count to 10 backwards. Her dad returned. She drank water and was feeling much better after about 20 more minutes.

I alerted a nurse, who took held my head and helped me regulate breathing as I started to pass out. She held an ice pack to my neck and got me water.  She and another nurse tried to move towards an open door for fresh air and wanted to lay me down on a gurney, but I couldn&#39;t stand so they carried me to a wheelchair, where I stayed for about 35 minutes more until I had recovered. I don&#39;t think I fully lost consciousness, but almost completely lost sight and hearing. I was not consciously anxious about getting the vaccine or needles.

Patient requested to lie down on the floor with my assistance.  After a couple of minutes,  she stated she felt a little better and asked to sit up on the floor. We offered water and she drank  it. Her symptoms slowly improves as I was monitoring her. She had someone picked her up around 11:30a.m. Advised her to follow up with her primary provider and call medical personnel when necessary.

                                                Minimal pain around injection site within 15 minutes of receiving injection. Minimal pain until around 3 am, woke up with severe muscle pain that continued to worsen into the next day- 4/14/2021. I could barely move my arm, the pain had me in tears a few times. Accompanied by inflammation surrounding injection site. Used a cold pack on the area within the first 24 hours, it did not help nor did ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or acetaminophen. Used a heating pad on low on the area to help with muscle stiffness, it helped minimally. Today, 4/15, the pain and inflammation is improved greatly but hives developed along with a very mild temperature. Symptoms improving overall

                                                4/4: Woke up Easter Sunday with the following symptoms: sweats, chills, uncontrollable shaking, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Went to Urgent Care, but it was closed for the holiday, so instead went to ER. See Item 19 for details. I was discharged within an hour because there was nothing seriously wrong with me, doctor wrote it off as a stomach bug and ordered me to rest and hydrate.  4/4 - 4/10: Virtually every day for this week went the exact same. I would wake up between 6-7am, feel nauseous, weak, no appetite, and shaking. Walking around my apartment would leave me utterly exhausted. I would nap from 9am-12pm, then again from 2-4pm. Ate very little, drank water and sports drinks when awake. Breathing was still shaky. Occasional diarrhea.  4/10: Although slightly less ill than the previous 6 days, I still felt weak, shaky, and exhausted. I went back to Urgent Care this time, and the doctor examined me. She noted my left ear was very inflamed and suspected an ear infection. She prescribed me a week of amoxycilin and told me to rest and eat bland foods.  4/12: After 2 days on the antibiotics, some of my symptoms cleared. I was no longer shaking or having shortness of breath, and although still tired, I did not sleep for half the day as I had the previous week. My appetite was not fully there yet, and in the mornings of this week I would wake up feeling nauseous for about 2 hours. On this day 4/12 my period also started, which is unusual. It was not due to start until around April 17th. My period is very regular and light due to being on birth control, so I consider this abnormal. The flow was also very heavy.   4/17: Heavy flow of my period slows significantly and is now just a slight pink/brown color. I only need a liner to contain it. This is also my last day of antibiotics, so I buy a probiotic supplement in the hopes that it will help settle my gut.  4/17-present (4/20): The morning nausea and lack of appetite are still present despite being off the antibiotics. Occasional discomfort in abdomen/chest. Unexplained muscle soreness in hips, legs, back, and chest. My bowel movement schedule has also completely changed. Normally I do not experience a bowel movement until late morning, after 10am. But for the past 2 weeks I have been woken up around 5:30am with a sudden urge. At the beginning of my illness it was diarrhea but now it has transitioned to slightly more solid feces. It is not really diarrhea anymore.

                                                Received 2nd vaccine at 1:30pm on a Sunday afternoon. Woke up in the early hours of Monday not feeling great, didn&#39;t sleep well. Woke up at 8am for work with extreme chills, aches and pains. Tried to get up to get water, was so nauseous and lightheaded, I felt like I was going to pass out. Could barely stand up straight. Walked back to room and collapsed onto bed. Dry heaved into a trash can for a few minutes, feeling like I was about to throw up. Did not throw up. Took 2 Tylenol layed in bed, unable to move as I was extremely dizzy, nauseous and generally unwell. Fever of 99.?? (I forget). Fell asleep and woke up 2 hours later feeling better. Tylenol wore off around 5pm. Extreme chills and body aches came back. Fever of 100.4. Did not want to eat but had a few pieces of bread. Went to bed like normal that night. Felt almost back to normal the next day, still a little nausea with low energy but no fevers.

The following day, my arm hurt much worse and the rest of my body began to ache throughout the morning. I developed a fever at 99.5°. Took Advil which helped a lot. Advil started to wear off at about 1:30. At that time, I became nauseous and a little dizzy. I ended up going home early from work because of it. That night, I had such intense pain around my midsection I could barely move and deep breaths such as a yawn hurt way more.

The next day when I woke up my arm was not sore anymore but I was feeling fatigued, dizzy and nauseous. My head and the rest of my body have felt extremely heavy since. It is hard to get out of bed and perform daily activities. When I eat I often feel nauseous afterwards or have diarrhea, even if the food is light.  I have taken Advil and Tylenol occasionally as treatment, but they did not help much so I haven&#39;t taken anything since. There are certain times where I am feeling a bit better, like yesterday on 4/30 and on 4/24, but the symptoms keep coming back even though I am staying hydrated and eating and getting plenty of rest and sleep.

                                                Woke up at 2am crying from whole body being in pain. Could not stop shivering even when covered in 4 blankets but also sweating. Managed to sleep for a few hours before waking up with the worst headache- it felt like someone had wrapped something around my head and was squeezing. Moving made it worse. Could barely stand and head was foggy.

My hands became tingly/numb as well as my legs. This lasted about a half hour where I felt I could faint at any moment. My arm is currently sore 7 hours later and I am fatigued.

                                                I got the second dose of the vaccine on May 11th 2020. I am currently on my second week for completing the vaccine. When it all started I was just laying down on my couch watching Netflix with my laptop on my lap (this was Thursday night, May 20th). My leg fell asleep but I didn?t think anything of it because once I started walking around it went back fine. However, On May 21st, Friday morning I was having serious pain in my left thigh. I believed it was a muscle strain. I did a cold compress, warm bath and took Tylenol from Friday to Saturday. I thought it got better but however by May 23rd, Sunday night I was incapable of walking on my own and needed assistance just to go to the bathroom. On May 24th I went to Urgent Care and they stated that I may have a blood clot so I went to the ER. While at the ER they stated I had a massive blood clot that would need a procedure done to remove it and was later admitted into the hospital and scheduled for the procedure. The blood clot travels from my groin to my ankle on my left thigh. They stated the reason for my blood clot would of been because of my birth control. And it?s possible reaction to me also taking the Pfizer vaccine. I have been on birth control for over 5 years and have not had any problems until now. I also do not have any history or family history of blood clots. I did not hit my thigh or have done any exercises for this to occur.

                                                Pt had received her first vaccine and was in the observation area. She was seen to have slumped in her chair, preceding a syncopal episode. The patient remained in her chair during the episode. Pt informed us after the syncopal episode that she had felt as if she fell asleep. She has no medical history of seizures or syncope in the past. She did have limb movement during the period of syncope. The episode seemed to last no more than 15 seconds. The patient quickly woke and began speaking to us. She was clammy and sweaty, vitals were completely normal as taken by the RNs. She was observed in the private area for &gt; 15 minutes, given drink and crackers, tolerated well. She ambulated well and had her fiancé pick her up.  She will follow up with her PCP this week.   vitals:   BP: 120/80, P 72, O2 98%

                                                So at around 9pm the evening of my shot, I started feeling feverish so I went to the other room to get my temperature and while I was waiting for my temperature to be recorded, I started to feel lightheaded and I called out for help. I woke up on the floor, I woke up to my roommate and boyfriend standing over me. They were on the phone with 9-1-1. I was out for about a minute and unresponsive. According to them, my arm was flailing and seizure-ish. I went to the ER, I was taken by EMS services. They gave me fluids and ran bloodwork and monitored me. They sent me home, I did have another episode of what I think was an episode of memory loss/passed out. I just remembered waking up in a room alone. I was at the ER for about 4-5 hours. They gave me IV fluids and I don&#39;t remember what else, some sort of supplement. It was magnesium oxide they gave me. When I left the ER I was really exhausted, and feverish and gross and I was pretty sick for the remaining two days. I didn&#39;t sleep well that night, I had a fever the following day and into the second day upon returning home as well.

                                                Suspected bursitis with prolonged arm pain and weakness 2 weeks after first Pfizer dose. On the day of vaccination, I had a panic attack and nearly blacked out after vaccination, something that had never happened to me after a vaccination. Once the pain started a few hours after vaccination, it significantly increased. I experienced excruciating pain in my left arm like I had never felt after any other vaccination. Complete inability to move my arm without pain; the pain persisted even with zero movement whatsoever. Within the first 12 hours the pain spread to my entire left shoulder, and within 24 hours the pain spread to my neck, and general upper left quadrant of my body to the point where inhaling deeply would cause chest pain on my left side. This extreme pain persisted for about 3-4 days. After about the 5th day, my left arm still felt different and weaker than my right arm but little pain remained. After the 7th day, pain started back up whenever I tried to use my arm in any way. The days went on and the pain and arm weakness is not passing. It is minor pains, aches, and occasional throbbing compared to those first few days after vaccination but chronic pain nonetheless. My left arm continues to feel weak and I have a concentrated area of pain directly where the vaccination site was, it&#39;s as if I could still feel exactly where the needle went through my body. My arm feels okay pain-wise upon waking most days but I am unable to do anything as simple as chopping vegetables or washing dishes without feeling pain for the rest of the day. I am unable to even wear a backpack for more than 10 minutes without my left shoulder hurting and feeling fatigued.

                                                I got the vaccine some time in the night when i was taking a shower i noticed arm soreness. when i went to bed around 11pm from the top of my shoulder down to my finger tips it was swollen and had arm pain. I tried to go to bed and about 30 minutes later i went to get up to grab some advil. I checked in the mirror to see if there was redness and got light headed. Next thing i know i passed out. I woke up on the floor and a big pool of blood i dont know how long i was out for. I had a nose bleed and had a bruise on my head, I could leave the bath room because i was shaking so bad and couldnt use any force to get up. After 45 mins that i went to my room and called my mom who is a physican i sat on the floor for 3 or 4 hours until i could get the nose bleed to stop. I ended up then getting into bed and the shacking had stopped after 800 mg of advil. I checked my pupils for signs of cuncussion. the 1/25 i had my first appointment and we checked to see if i broke my nose. after that the next days they did see signs of concussion with sleeping 20 hours a day and blurry vision. I went back to  med center to get an mri and eeg to see about the concussion because they were worried since i didnt know how long i was out for. They also sent me to a concussion specialist. I had follow up care about the concussion for a month or so.  For about a week floowing the vaccine i was taking 800mg 3times a day for the tremor&#39;s and fever

A 24-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 11May2021 at 14:45 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was taking unspecified birth control medication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was on her second week of completing the vaccine. The patient reported that on Thursday night, 20May2021, she was just laying down on her couch watching Netflix with her laptop on her lap, her leg fell asleep but she didn&#39;t think anything of it because once she started walking around it went back fine. However, on 21May2021, Friday morning, she was having serious pain in her left thigh. She believed it was a muscle strain. The patient did a cold compress, warm bath and took Tylenol from Friday to Saturday. She thought it got better but by 23May2021, Sunday night, she was incapable of walking on her own and needed assistance just to go to the bathroom. On 24May2021, she went to Urgent Care and they stated that she may have a blood clot so she went to the ER (Emergency Room). While at the ER they said she had a massive blood clot from her thigh to her ankle. She would need a procedure done to remove it and was later admitted into the hospital and scheduled for the procedure. Blood thinners and suctioning out the blood clot was done as treatment. The patient been tested for COVID-19 (nasal swab) on 24May2021 with a result of negative. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Patient reported feeling faint as soon as she was injected then she fainted in the chair she was sitting in. Seconds later she had a seizure lasting approx. 7 to 10 seconds. When she woke up she said she&#39;S had seizures before ?but not for a while?. She also said she hadn?t eaten that day. She rested in our facility&#39;s Clinic until she felt well enough to go home. In the Clinic she was given some glucose tablets and water and the NP checked her blood pressure. The patient consulted with her doctor by phone . When I spoke with the patient on 6/4/21 she had plans to see her doctor and possibly be referred to a neurologist.

                                                I first started to experience very mild spotting and it seemed very irregular because I was taking my birth control on time. I also had Cramps; fatigue and dizziness and mood swings. Like I was getting a period without the period. Then the same symptoms happened a week later. I called the doctor to get phone appt with GYN Dr. I was not pregnant; she thought it might be hormonal imbalance and said to give it another month to see if it happened again. I have been on this same birth control for 10 years. Yesterday, June 23,  I started having the same symptoms but I haven&#39;t started with any of the spotting yet so I had cramps; fatigue and dizziness and mood springs. Today, I&#39;m not experiencing these symptoms.

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

Pre-vaccination and post-vaccination COVID tests were not performed. No therapeutic measures were taken as result of the events. The patient had recovered from the events in Dec2020.

                                                Immediately after vaccine I had a bad headache which was cleared up with Ibuprofen. Then 12 Hours after vaccine my arm became VERY sore, took my ibuprofen and alternated with Acetaminophen.  Then my face became very flushed (I used ice packs) and I got a mild sore throat. That night I had difficulty sleeping. I kept waking up with terrible body aches. About 24 hours after the vaccine I just had fatigue, mild fever, and chills. I slept on and off throughout the day and then started to feel better. But at about 32 hours post vaccine I started to feel worse. My headache and sore arm came back and I became very light headed and dizzy.

Woke up at 5am with body aches and headache. Sat on the toilet but felt dizzy, had ringing in my ears, and felt woosy. Laid  back on bed and raised feet above my head. Took my temperature, it was 99.3F, which is a little high for me.  Ringing stopped after I laid down.

There was no medical history. Concomitant medication included valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX), topiramate (TOPAMAX), lamotrigine (LAMICTAL), duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA), ziprasidone hydrochloride (GEODON). On 06Jan2021 at 12:30, The patient experienced heart rate shot up to 170 with numbness of feet, started to feel chest pain, and feeling like she was going to vomit and faint.

The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event &#34;feeling like she was going to vomit&#34; was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other reported serious events with BNT 162b2 can not be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                15 hours after vaccine, I woke up with a severe headache and extreme fatigue. 18 hours after vaccine, I showered and felt very dizzy. I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

Throat started to close up, tingling sensation throughout entire body, rush of heat, dizziness, increased heart rate. Made it back to the site (closest medical professionals near me) where my throat still felt swollen but I could breathe. Chest hurt and was still dizzy. Was given 50mg Benadryl &amp; 20mg Pepsid. It seemed to come and go in waves but I still went to the ER. ER doc said what he saw I was experiencing was anxiety. Pharmacist who had been with me the whole time could tell that my neck and throat had been swollen but had gone down with the Benadryl. ER administered anti nausea meds and a steroid shot. Also prescribed steroids for a few days. Received the shot at 6:45, initial reaction occurred around 7:10, went to the ER around 8:45

                                                Five minutes after vaccine, I started having trouble breathing. Thought it was anxiety attack but I didn&#39;t feel anxious. I felt light headed and I don&#39;t get that with my panic attacks; At 15 minutes, my heart was beating really fast. They checked my vitals - pulse and BP was elevated. Pulse is over 130 and normally when I have an anxiety attack it doesn&#39;t go above 110. Went to the  ER . The breathing felt better after thirty min after being in ER and Blood pressure 1-2 hours later went down. No treatment. After about two weeks I saw my primary care doctor for check up.

                                                I sat at the hospital for 15 mins after my vaccine shot and was ok. However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

Patient states she received 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine at hospital earlier today, reports approximately 5 minutes later she felt very weak and lightheaded, and had episode of shortness of breath. She did use her inhaler (albuterol) which improved her symptoms.  Upon my initial assessment, she denies any complaints and states she feels back to baseline.  Denies any shortness of breath.  Patient never developed any rash.  No history of allergic reactions in the past.

                                                Friday- headache 2 hours after injection. Right Eye twitch Saturday- body aches, headache turned into a migraine on the entire right side of my head. I could not lift my right arm, I was exhausted doing everyday things.  Sunday- migraine wouldn?t go away. I got body chills but it wasn?t until later at night. And my body aches became moderate.  Monday- my migraine went down to a headache but my body aches wouldn?t go away. I did not take any pills. Throughout the day. I was tired. It was hard moving around. I was kind of sluggish but not as much as Tuesday. Tuesday- severe body aches. Both my arms hurt but I thought it was just due to laying in bed after getting home from work at 2:30 on Monday. Severe pain in my shoulders and middle of my back. I did some stretches thinking maybe my body was just sore from laying down. Went to bed at 12 because I couldn?t keep warm and my back was killing me.  Wednesday- horrible ache though out my back I got up to move but it hurt so much. I?m walking so slow. I need to rest on the walls because it hurts so much to move. My headache is still there. I took midol at 1:30pm;  did not do much. I?ve been trying to move about and stretch but my body does not allow me. Even typing hurts I cannot keep a good grip on things. My arms, entire left side of my back and many thighs  are in pain

A non-pregnant 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3246), intramuscular in left arm, on 15Jan2021 at 14:15, at 0.3 mL, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amfetamine aspartate monohydrate/ amfetamine sulfate/ dexamfetamine saccharate/ dexamfetamine sulfate (MYDAYIS), buspirone hydrochloride (BUSPAR), and ethinylestradiol/ norethisterone acetate (MICROGESTIN). The patient previously took cefotaxime sodium (OMNICEF) and amoxicillin sodium/clavulanate potassium (AUGMENTIN) and experienced allergies to both drugs. The patient worked on a COVID-19 study. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. On 18Jan2021 at 03:00 AM, the patient had a pounding heart rate beginning two days after vaccination and had felt faint. The patient received her first dose on Friday and then last night (3 AM; also reported as 2-3 AM) she started having rapid heart rate like it was pounding out of her chest. It woke her up in the middle of the night around 2-3 AM so it was this morning around 2-3 AM. The patient can still feel like her heart is pounding out of her chest, but it is improved a little bit since it began. It is a little better now but is still persistent. No treatment was given for the adverse events. The patient was not sure if that is something that has been reported before. She did not know what to do but she wanted to try to find out if it was because of the vaccine. The patient did report it online already, she did the event reporting, but she would be happy answer more questions. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination. The patient was recovering from the events

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 25-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number=EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at site of right arm on 20Jan2021 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medication included vitamin D3 and iron (SLOW RELEASE IRON) and daily multivitamin. Within minutes of receiving the dose on 20Jan2021 at 09:45 AM, dizziness, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, flushed, weakness, and shakiness. About an hour after receiving the dose on 20Jan2021, lethargy, chilled, in particular hands were very cold, pale color, mental fog, and slurred speech. The patient did not receive any treatment from events. The outcome of events was recovered in Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported temporary mental fog/mental impairment was likely related to first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I am a third-year medical student. Since receiving the second dose of the COVID vaccine (Pfizer) on Tuesday 2/2, I have had persistent and worsening muscle spasms of the torso. I presented to the Emergency room on 2/6 due to worsening symptoms and was admitted until 2/7. The neurology team evaluated my condition was not able to make a firm diagnosis. They believe the vaccine has caused a dystonic reaction. I was given benadryl 25mg to continue for one week q6 hours prn. However, benadryl has provided minimal relief. They also strongly recommended that I be seen by a movement disorder specialist at hospital ASAP.  However, due to the fact that I have insurance I am not covered for care from hospital. My insurance said they will review the referral which will take another 5-7 business days from today 2/9. As a medical student, I have had to miss one week of clinic rotations and will continue to miss vital medical training as well as my board exam this Friday due to my worsening symptoms. It has created such a negative impact on my life including pausing my medical training, and physically being incapable of driving or performing many of my basic daily activities. I live alone and near hospital. I am urgently requesting if there is anyway CDC can help me, a medical student who has put in her all to fight the pandemic alongside you.   I am extremely concerned about my symptoms and the panic that it has created for my family and friends. I hope that a rapid response can help me and my loved ones find some answers during these challenging times.

                                                At 7:00am the morning after receiving my second dose of the vaccine, I arose from bed and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

                                                Within 1 hour of injection (10:00am), began experiencing fatigue that got increasingly worse. By 2:00pm, had slurred speech; severe fatigue; red skin on hands, face, neck; balance problems and dizziness; swollen hands. That evening through the next morning, I was experienced severe flu-like symptoms, including vertigo, extremely severe fatigue, and full-body muscle aches. My temperature was slightly elevated (98.7) from my &#34;baseline,&#34; which is around 96.7. On Saturday, I was very tired, no appetite, still experiencing some vertigo and muscle aches. Symptoms improved overnight and by Sunday evening, I was mostly back to normal, with some lingering fatigue.

                                                Within a minute after the vaccine was administered, I started to sweat a lot, felt hot, and got very dizzy. I was also nauseous. The nurse was very responsive and had me put my jacket on, zip it all the way up, and allowed me to lay down. She provided water and snacks. I was very dizzy for 5-10 minutes. The nurse helped me perform calming excecises, which helped a lot. I then slowly started to feel better. After about 30 minutes I was able to stand up and felt mostly normal. It has been 3 hours and I am only a little fatigued, but otherwise okay. I have not had any issues with shots in my adulthood, but as a child, I remember turning white and vomiting after a flu shot. So I may be subconsciously adverse to shots.

I did not do anything for the symptoms at that time.  I was just drinking water and waiting for those symptoms going away and they went away in about four- six hours.  Doctor check-up the following Monday for these symptoms but the hives were gone. I was nauseous for about four days. I was kind of tired. At injection site - it was kind of red and swollen but those went away after one day - that I got when I had the hives and irritated/swollen throat. I started having dizziness - a few hours after the vaccine and that lasted for about six days where I would get dizzy on and off throughout the day.  I had my second vaccine on February 6 2021. I was recovered from these adverse events before 2nd dose.

                                                Intermittent dizziness - not full on vertigo, but just a woozy feeling in head  First and second doses of Pfizer vaccine had instant dizziness with an awful reaction to second dose. Chills, fever, aches, nausea, dizzy.   Dizziness came back intermittently on March 8 along with on and off bilateral tingling of hands and back of calves along with occasional feet.  It has slightly gotten better but still dealing with it intermittently.  Talked to multiple doctors and had blood tests ran- all was normal. One said could very much be reaction to vaccine.

I remained dizzy for the next 4 days feeling like I was on a boat. By the 6th day it was even worse. It has lasted over 3 weeks now and is ongoing. I have been trying the epley maneuver as I was instructed to do so by my doctor and take my allergy medication (Flonase) to potentially decrease inflammation as well as take tylenol. I will be going to see an ENT specialist next week to try to get some relief. It has been horrible and I haven&#39;t been able to work full time for the last 2 weeks.

                                                After almost two weeks I started feeling feverish and achy all over my body. I had head pain almost to the point of migraine, felt weak and lost my appetite. Every time I stood up I felt sharp pain on the top of my head and got lightheaded. These symptoms responded a little to medication such as Tylenol and DayQuil but steadily worsened over the course of a few days then suddenly worsened. I woke up yesterday feeling more feverish and weak to the point where my mobility was compromised. My head felt like a balloon and hurt around the base of my skull and the top of my head. I had even more severe light sensitivity and could not tolerate sound. I also couldn?t bend down to pick something up or tie my shoes because of the lightheadedness and pain. The headache and migraine symptoms responded well to Toradol and Excedrin but returned full force after any medicine wore off. I am not getting any better despite rest and treatment.

                                                I received the vaccine in my left arm and noticed the pain in my left arm and armpit the day after receiving the shot. 2 days after receiving the shot, I noticed the swelling of my left lymph node in my left armpit. It was very painful to move my arm or leave my arm resting in a normal position since it would put pressure on my lymph node. I had very limited mobility on days 2,3 and 4 after the vaccine but quickly improved starting day 5 with very minimal pain. I had a video call with a doctor who recommended 800mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours &amp; warm compress on the lymph node. In general, I had very minimal symptoms from the first vaccine except the lymph node swelling &amp; pain. Starting day 5 post vaccine I was basically back to normal &amp; have felt good ever since.

When I measured a few hours later it was at 137/90. It remained like that until the evening when it lowered back down to 120/87. Later that evening, I had a fever and took Tylenol to help. My headache got worse in the evening as well. Arm was sore. This morning (day after my 1st dose) my BP was at 108/79, fever creeped up as the day went on, body aches, arm was hurting more,  headache continued, pressure on chest made it a bit hard to breathe, dizziness, some nausea, brain fog.

                                                At 2:43pm patient received the vaccine in her arm. At 2:50pm my pharmacy technician witnessed the patient standing up from her chair and walk up to the pharmacy counter then faint into the pharmacy immunization booth. My technician states the patient did not hit her head on a wall. At 2:51pm my pharmacy technician brought the incident to my attention and we both ran to the patient to address the situation.  The patient was unresponsive, so I ran and dial 911 then instructed my tech to take the phone. I then ran back to the patient and patted her back, said her name and asked her if she could hear me.  It was at that moment the patient&#39;s eyes flickered and the patient had what looked to me like a 10 second seizure in the chair inside the pharmacy booth.  Once the patient was done what I could only identify as seizing, she came to and I asked her if she new her name and where she was. The patient answered correctly and then asked me &#34;Have you had anyone with a reaction like this before?&#34;. I answered that I have not personally witnessed a reaction like this before. My technician had 911 still on the phone and they instructed her to stand out front of the store to await the ambulance. A first responding officer came in and asked about the witnesses to the incident then took over for caring for the patient.

                                                I had the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 4/6 and felt dizzy 30 minutes later. The dizziness continued for the next 84 hours. On 4/9 (three days after vaccination), I fainted on my  driveway as I was heading home around noon time. I felt dizzy the whole afternoon but were trying to help out the groceries from the car. I fell down on the concrete driveway with two bags of groceries on my hand. I did not blackout, but were not able to get up for 10 seconds due to the dizziness. I eventually recovered from the dizziness 84 hours after the first dose of vaccine. I injured my knee as I fell, but the wound were treated at home immediately.  As for the sore arm, I could not hold any items heavier than 1 lb. The arm soreness went away after 48 hours with ice pack applied on upper arm(injection area).

Within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine, hives developed on my left thigh. The tongue swelling, shortness of breath and faintness happened on and off for the first day. It resolved on its own by the next day. The hives got progressively worse and peaked roughly 48 hours after getting the vaccine. They slowly faded, but are still faintly noticeable. I had general malaise  for the rest of the week. I have photos showing the progression of the hives.

The patient shortly after expressing this concern slumped over in the chair, shaking and twitching, for a few moments (likely 60 seconds or less) before regaining normal stature and attention. The patient expressed some changes in her field of vision, a continuation of feeling light-headed, and a ringing in her ears.  EMS was called to evaluate the patient, concerned that the patient had experienced seizure activity. EMS arrived shortly after, evaluating the patient&#39;s current state and vitals. After assessment, EMS determined this was a syncopal episode related to the patient&#39;s anxiety around the vaccination and cleared the patient to drive themselves home after resting on-site. Patient rested and recovered in pharmacy vaccination room for an additional 20 minutes before leaving.

                                                At 5:15 pm, same day as shot, a migraine occurred. A bad migraine, unable to stand because it caused so much pain in my head. at 8:00PM I went to bed due to the pain. at 1:15 AM, my body was in pain. My right rib cage hurt so bad that I couldn&#39;t sleep on my right side. My legs, back, and pelvic bones were in so much pain as well. I felt as if my bones were going to break or I had severely bruised my bones. Breathing, coughing, sneezing hurt because of my rib cage hurting. My migraine had not gone away, and my lymph nodes were really swollen. Couldn&#39;t put my arms down, my neck was swollen and walking hurt because my legs were swollen. This occurred for 24 hours. Next day, migraine is gone and left a headache. Swelling is still prominent and bones still hurt.

                                                14 hours after the vaccine was received, I woke up so uncomfortable, no matter how I moved I couldn?t get comfortable. It was the kind of uncomfortable where I swear I could feel it in my bones. Laid in bed until 8:30 when baby boy woke up, promptly threw up, got so nauseated and dizzy that I could not move from the bathroom floor, and had to ask grandma to bring me my medicines. The mix of ibuprofen, migraine medication, and anti-nausea all combined made me feel no symptoms for several hours until they wore off and I lost all ability to stand. My legs just felt so weak. And now I?m finally starting to feel a little better, and it?s been 2.5 days now. Boy, those side effects are no joke. Still worth it though so I don?t bring a deadly virus home to my baby boy ?????

                                                I had joint and muscle pain throughout my body, dizziness and weakness three days after my vaccine after giving blood that Saturday at 11 am. The pain was throughout my body so much that I couldn&#39;t do my normal functions.  I also developed stomach pain a day after I gave whole blood. These symptoms lasted 5 days, after which I still had some muscle pains and weakness but not that I couldn&#39;t continue on in my normal activities. The muscle pain and weakness symptoms lasted another week before I felt more normal, although, the stomach pain went away after about 5 days.   After my second dose on April 7th, 2021 with Pfizer lot number ER8727 in my left arm, I was tired and had a little bit of muscle pain right away but these symptoms only lasted 24 hours after my shot at 9am that Wednesday I received that dose.

                                                Extreme fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and chest tightness. Started about a week after the 2nd dose of the vaccine and was the worst approximately 2.5 weeks out. Slight improvements after 3 weeks but symptoms persist. Not able to stand/move for more than 5-10 minutes at a time. Chest tightness worsens when sitting upright and is slightly improved when lying on side. Had multiple labs run and all were within normal range. Doctor&#39;s only recommendation is to wait for symptoms to resolve on their own.

                                                I woke up with severe vertigo &amp; nausea on Sunday, May 2nd. Continued to experience severe vertigo until Wednesday, May 5th. I had trouble walking, moving my head &amp; eyes to the side or vertically, and couldn&#39;t tolerate bright lights or loud sounds. Vertigo symptoms mainly subsided on Wednesday evening, but I have been experiencing other symptoms since then. I have felt very &#34;off&#34; as if I&#39;m floating, or high on drugs (I have not taken any medication for this). I&#39;ve experienced a headache and felt lightheaded, and dizzy if I make certain head movements. I have never experienced anything like this before. I&#39;ve had vertigo once before this, but it only lasted several hours and I did not experience any other symptoms. I also experienced slight vertigo (only a couple of seconds) as the first symptom of COVID when I had it in March 2020.

Following lunch I took an Advil, which did not relieve the pain. I began feeling faint around 1:30pm and went to lie down. While lying down, I began to experience uncontrollable full body convulsions while still in a state of partial consciousness. This episode of full-body convulsions was reported to me to have lasted about 15 minutes. Following this episode I returned to normal, with even the headache gone. The next day, I woke up with a severe migraine that lasted for 11 hours, causing nausea and vomiting. I have never had such a severe and long migraine.

While walking I immediately had paralyzing pain from right under my left hip area shooting straight down the front outer part of my leg. It has continued since then. No swelling though. They had me stay an additional 15 minutes to check for swelling and to see if the pain would go away; it did not. Doesn&#39;t hurt much when I sit, just when I put pressure on my leg to walk. My left butt cheek did begin hurting 35 minutes later when we left. They didnt know how to respond so they just gave me ibuprofen for the pain so I am letting that kick in now to hopefully help. If it doesn&#39;t then I will either see my regular physician or go to the ER

                                                After receiving my second dose, I was seen by my primary doctor for suspected Celiac disease (which came back positive). I had a strange medical episodes during the bloodwork (April 15th) that they originally assumed was anxiety. Symptoms were shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and loss of feeling in extremities. I?m a first responder and did not feel this was anxiety, but didn?t argue and forgot about it until it happened again.   I had my second episode on April 20th, and debated going to the ER for it. A third episode on April 23rd did put me in the ER. I proceeded to have more episodes on almost a daily basis after that and started monitoring blood pressure, pulse, blood sugar, and food intake at home (some of my bloodwork levels were off due to the celiac). I purchased a heart rate monitor, a blood glucose meter, and a smartwatch to monitor some of my symptoms. Both devices (monitor and watch) would later flag me as having a suspicious heart rhythm (heart monitor could be for fast/slow rhythm or for arrhythmia, smartwatch flagged me as Afib twice). I could not recreate these results when my husband wore the devices.  Episodes could be as brief as 45 mins or last more than 12 hours. I have a high pain tolerance and illness tolerance, and had to leave work several times due to my symptoms (extremely abnormal for me).   After several more appointments with my primary doc and another visit to the ER (where they did another EKG, an X-ray, and more bloodwork), things were still coming back inconclusive.  After about April 28th, I started having significant chest pain with my episodes. The ER checked me for possible clotting related to the heart issues and my birth control pills. My arrhythmia could not be captured on their devices.   My doctor has since diagnosed it as suspected myocarditis (pending more testing). We?ve ruled out all possible things related to my Celiac diagnosis, and can?t seem to find a cause for this. I had a few things I brought to her attention that may be the cause (pinched nerve at chiropractors, covid vaccine) and she says it may be the vaccine, and said I should report it to you.

                                                Aside from the usual chills, body aches, etc, I ended up calling my doctor over a separate concerning issue - very high heart rate. I woke up at 8am the day after getting my 2nd Pfizer dose, walked to use the restroom, walked back to bed, and laid back down. Within a couple minutes I noticed my heart felt like it was racing and I was out of breath as if I had just come back from a jog, not a trip to the restroom.  Heart rate continued fluctuating from 105-115bpm just laying in bed. Was also feeling fatigued, nauseous, dizzy when standing up, and with slight difficulty breathing. Called advice nurse after 30min of no change. They had me check heart rate manually (had been going off FitBit), and timing was consistent with what FitBit was reading . Nurse advised to keep resting and drink lots of water, scheduled follow-up with a Doctor later in the morning.  It should be noted that I had been alternating between water and Pedialyte constantly all day, starting 5/17 through when this happened (and then the next few days as well), so I should not have been dehydrated. Follow-up call with Dr. (on-call Dr., not my usual one) was scheduled for 11:45am, and by then all concerning heart symptoms had passed. The Dr. basically reiterated what the nurse had told me, in keeping up with fluids. And that sometimes temperature change, even if you don&#39;t completely get a fever, can cause a high heart rate. As more information is coming out regarding younger people developing myocarditis after the mRNA vaccines however, I wanted to mention this in case it could possibly be related.

Skins were warm, dry, and normal. Chief complaint of  &#34;dizziness, rapid heart rate, and feeling hot&#34; was reassessed and patient stated that symptoms had subsided. Patient explained that the symptoms had a sudden onset, but lasted less than 1 minute. Patient has a history of migraines and an allergy to Penicillin. Patient stated that she had a similar reaction after receiving a dose of Benadryl, earlier this year. Patient told EMTs that she had eaten toast, tofu, and salad about an hour and a half prior to coming to the vaccination site, with limited fluid intake. EMTs gave the patient a water bottle to sip on. At 1502 a second set of vital signs were obtained by EMT, while the patient was sitting: blood pressure: 116/68, heart rate: 74, respiratory rate: 15. Pupils were equal, accommodating, and reactive to light. Patient was advised to stay an additional 30 minutes in observation for continued evaluation.

                                                About 5 to 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient reported feeling unwell, saying she felt like she was about to faint. She reported no chest tightness, shortness of breath, or trouble breathing upon being asked.   She drank some water. I (the pharmacist who administered the vaccine) then asked her to lay flat on the floor, which she did. The pharmacy technician called 911, but the patient said she was going to be ok and refused an ambulance. I took her pulse manually, and it was about 59 BPM. After about 5 minutes of lying down, she said she was feeling well enough to get up and sat back up on a chair. She did not lose consciousness at any time. She drank some Gatorade. I took her blood pressure and pulse twice about three minutes apart with an automatic monitor and the readings were 127/78 mmHG, pulse 68BPM and 108/67, pulse 67 BPM, respectively. She remained sitting and drinking Gatorade for about 20 more minutes and then left.

                                                Immediately hit with dizzy spells. Was told to drink water and sit for 15 minutes. Left after 20 minutes and continued to feel tired and dizzy. Throughout the evening and night skin began to itch, my neck tightened up, my skin became extremely sensitive to touch, chills and shakes started to happen. I took an over the counter medicine lime Tylenol yet nothing has been helping. I current still have everything I described and a massive headache.  I am unable to move my left arm without extreme pain and the pain has been spreading down the arm.

She stayed and extra 30 minutes to call down. She says the tingling in legs was gone but the arm and hand she receivied the vaccine in were still a little tingly. Informed pt that if she felt and worse or anything out of the ordinary to go to ER.
