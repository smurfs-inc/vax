It is weird. He never had that before.  He doesn&#39;t know what the do. If it was normal or it was symptoms of COVID. Second one will be on 12Jan2020. Should he get tested for COVID. Wanted to know if he should get the second dose. The outcome of events, fever, chill, felt cold, sweating a lot was recovering. The outcome of sore throat and cannot smell anything was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Approximately 20 hours after I received the second vaccine dose, I developed a fever of 102 F. This was associated with other moderate-to-severe flu-like symptoms including chills, myalgias, and headache. Within 3 hours, the fever decreased to 99-100 F and remained between 98-99 F throughout the rest of the day. The headache and myalgias persisted, but by the following day (today), nearly all symptoms had resolved. No GI symptoms were experienced.

Later that night, about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, I experienced mild wheezing for less than 5 minutes, but believe this was likely due to allergies and associated postnasal drip rather than the vaccine.  The following day I had mild muscle soreness and injection site pain without swelling or redness.

The first couple days I had a really sore left arm, but didn?t feel any ?side effects? until about Wednesday, 1/6 (about a week later). I remember waking up to a sore left side of my upper body. The left side of my neck, chest, arm, and lymph node (under my left arm) felt weird. It was until about Saturday night, 1/9, that I felt my left under arm lymph node noticeably swollen. I had a bad headache and loss of energy, and overall feeling unwell. No fever or night sweats to report. I was absent from work on 1/11 and 1/12, as a result.  1/13 was my first day back and feel better. The swollen left lymph node is no longer present, but still slightly tired. I did not seek Medical Care for my symptoms.

A 40-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the arm on 07Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included clonazepam. The patient had historical vaccine first dose of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced tiredness. On unspecified date, the consumer stated, &#34;I just want to, I didn&#39;t have, I was just little tired with the first shot I received. But I am little concerning on the second one like I woke up at the middle of the night, I got it yesterday at about 13:00. I woke up at about 2:00 in the morning on 08Jan2021 nd I couldn&#39;t even really move but then I was up for most of the night. My temperature is like  between 102.6 and 103.5 and my back hurts really bad. So, I am hoping that these are normal things but I am curious at any point is there something I should watch out for taking on that stuff further. The first shot was not anywhere near to bad which I know is to be expected but the second one being the worse, it&#39;s like dramatic, I have had a fever for I don&#39;t know like eighteen hours. Is there anything I should just make sure, or like this can be a normal side effect, correct?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

At 3:15, the patient stated that his headache had increased to a pain scale of 9.  He wasn&#39;t doing well so the staff laid him down.  At this point the staff felt it was a situation that needed more attention.  They took the patient to the ER where he was given saline and something for headache.  The also drew labs. Not sure what labs they drew.

A 40-year-old male patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 21Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), COVID-19 in 2020 (Jun2020 or Jul2020; tested positive for COVID-19 at that time and has 3 tests after that which were all negative) and since then lost weight (2020), and root canal. The patient had no issues with vaccines in the past. There were issues with the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, because he would be positive to TB, but this is because of his culture, he is from a specific country, and so they cannot take that vaccine. The patient clarified that he did not take the TB vaccine, what he meant was he is aware he can&#39;t take it. On 21Dec2020, the patient works in healthcare and had a patient that came in that tested positive for COVID-19 and so because of that, everyone including him that came in contact with the COVID-19 positive patient had to check and get tested. This happened the same day as his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the test (Dec2020) came out negative. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had not had any antibody test for COVID-19. The patient asked the doctor, but she never scheduled him for that, until after last month, she talked to him about it, but by that time he told her that he doesn&#39;t need it now - it&#39;s been almost a year. The patient had the first dose on 21Dec2020 and at that time he did experience symptoms the next day (22Dec2020). At that time after the first dose administration (21Dec2020), he could not lift his arm and it was bruised under the arm. The next day (22Dec2020), he had back pain, with his neck he could not turn it (neck pain), he could not be on his left side where he got the shot on left arm, it was like that for 3 days. Then on Thursday (24Dec2020), he had headache every time he bended his head down, he would be sleeping and would wake up in middle of night because of the headache, it felt like a sinus headache on one side of the head, and when he bend his head down, he would feel it, it stayed this way till 29Dec2020 (Tuesday). The patient has a question trying to find out with his employer. They told them they need to take the vaccine, they pushed them to take the vaccine, he works in healthcare. If they get sick at the job, he asked if they (employer) would pay for it, how would he get paid. The job told him he gets paid sick days and asked how they would do that. The patient asked how long the vaccine was alive in the body and how does it work. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

Once he received the vaccine, he became nauseous, sweaty, clammy, dizzy and lightheaded. Pt explained to immunizer that he was switched to night shift and had taken his diabetic meds without food soon before his shift at 5:30pm. An EMT was on scene and she proceeded to call more medics. I checked on the pt and he was vomiting and very pale. Medics checked pt vitals and okayed him for work.

                                                When I woke up the morning after I receive the vaccine, it was very painful to move my left arm. The pain increased if I moved my arm greater than perpendicular to my body. The worst pain though with with my back. I could not stand up straight without a sharp pain starting in my lower back. I was also extremely tired. So I called into work took some Tylenol and went back to bed. By 1 o?clock that afternoon I had felt fine as if nothing had ever happened.

Laparoscopic appendectomy was completed on 3/14 with successful removal of &#34;acute gangrenous, perforated appendix&#34; and patient was discharged home the same day with no complications.

I was tested for Covid-19 but the test was negative. The fever came and went.  I had a two day period with no fever. The fever returned and I started to have signs of Jaundice. My Bilirubin was up to 14. I was hospitalized for five days as a result of the bilirubin level.  The physician thought that the vaccine caused an inflammatory response because of medical history.  Discharge from hospital was two weeks after vaccine and drain in place for three weeks after.

                                                I had difficulty concentrating and focusing on Wednesday evening, a little over a day after getting my first shot. The focusing/concentration issues went away by the next morning when I woke up, however I have been feeling very tired physically since then. I&#39;m yawning all day and have very little energy or interest in doing things I need to be doing.  I&#39;m not certain that this is vaccine related, and I&#39;m not super concerned about it yet as I&#39;m on Spring break from school, but I start virtual classes again on Monday and will be concerned if I&#39;m still super tired. If it doesn&#39;t go away by next weekend, I will likely resubmit/add on to this report if that is an option.  It is not a serious concern yet so I haven&#39;t contacted medical professionals yet, but I thought it might be a good idea to at least report that this has been going on to VAERS

Report 3 of 3. MI filed on report 1 of 3. A 40-year-old-male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (COVID VACCINE, Pfizer product, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot: Number: EL3302, NDC number: Unknown, Expiry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included sleep apnea (he started with CPAP and technically it was a BIPAP machine), bipolar disease (took psychiatric medications), lost weight, blood pressure and liver enzymes. On 17Mar2020, he quit smoking. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 26Jan2021, the patient experienced nasal congestion and cough. He had COVID test and it came back positive. It was reported that, &#34;they were vaccinated on 15Jan2021 with first dose. The Wednesday after which was about 5 days after the vaccine her husband got chills, sneezing, and fatigue. He did not call the doctor and did not get tested. About a week later her son had nasal congestion and cough. This was the third day for that. Called her son&#39;s doctor since this was the second person in the house to have symptoms. He had COVID test and it came back positive. Is the COVID vaccine enough to give a positive test. She had symptoms too, but she normally get sinusitis this time of year. No one had a fever. Her son was really congested. Maybe he will develop a fever down the line. She was at a quandary. She had to quarantine in case it was. Could the vaccination cause a positive COVID test result. She thought the symptoms should show up in 1 to 3 days. A week in between her husband and son and it was hard to believe. It should have been her to get it worse since she sleeps with her husband. Praise the Lord she had not. She and her husband had not been tested for COVID. Only her son was COVID tested. Wednesday morning he woke up and he was much more congested. He complained a little on Tuesday. He had sleep apnea and uses CPAP. He might have wanted cough medicine to help him sleep good. He said he did not sleep well. He was very tired and congested. On the evening of 26Jan2021 he was more congested than usual. He was tested yesterday and got positive results this morning. History and Investigations: he was in a lot better shape since living with them because he had lost over 100 pounds. He had sleep apnea. He started with CPAP and technically it was a BIPAP machine. They call it a CPAP. He was 355 pounds and now 228 pounds. Slowly loosing weight. He had bipolar disease and took psychiatric medications. Since he had lost weight he has had to decrease his doses. He was having problems with blood pressure in October. He was starting to feel faint and the doctor stopped his blood pressure medications. He had issues with his liver enzymes and he was not out of the woods yet. He had been a smoker on and off. He quit smoking on 17Mar2020. Caller declined to do provide information about her son&#39;s psychiatric medications and blood pressure medications for report. They bought a blood pressure cuff to keep track of his blood pressure. Since he got sick his blood pressure went up to 121/63. It was normally 110 to 114 over 63 to 70. She had also been keeping an eye on his temp and it went up about a degree. His pulse rate was up which you would expect. His pulse rate was usually between 55 and 68. That day it was 83. There was a product complaint. Caller was patient&#39;s mother. Vaccinated on 15Jan2021 with first dose. About a week later her son had nasal congestion and cough. This was the third day for that. Called her son&#39;s doctor since this was the second person in the house to have symptoms. He had COVID test and it came back positive. Is the COVID vaccine enough to give a positive test. Her son was really congested. Maybe he would develop a fever down the line. Could the vaccination cause a positive COVID test result. On the evening of 26Jan2021 he was more congested than usual.

                                                Within few minutes, I started feeling high heart rate and dizzy. Notified health care professional and they took me in to observe vitals. Heart rate and blood pressure was higher than normal. EKG looked normal but with higher heart rate. Started feeling better in an hour and went home. The high heart rate recurred the next several days but would go away after few minutes.  Occasionally I get a headache and feel resting heart rate is higher than before. Definitely feeling better after two weeks compared to day of the shot.

                                                Starting at 8pm on vaccination day I got loopy and disoriented, and had a hard time speaking intelligibly.  I also had trouble with balance and fine motor skills.  Had some personality changes too: became very moody with erratic mood swings. The next day I slept all day because of exhaustion and aches. When I woke up on Wednesday (36hrs later) I was literally screaming in pain because of how bad my arm and shoulder hurt. It hurt to move it, and hurt not to move it.  It was excruciating and ibuprofen didn&#39;t seem to help at all. Throughout Wednesday I could hardly move my left arm. Getting dressed or washing my hair was very difficult and very painful.  I was also still very uncoordinated. My left armpits lymph nodes were so swollen that (1) it filled in my entire armpit so there was no more pit, just a very soft bulge, and (2) the fluid extended all the way to my chest and it looked like I had one breast and one pec.

The first day, following the shot, I had a bit of soreness at the injection site but it was gone by the following day, Friday, 3/26/21. I had a general feeling of weakness the afternoon and into the night on the day of the shot as well. However, it was about midday or a bit after the following day that I began feeling obvious side effects. These include, primarily, a general feeling of being ill. Headache (but that&#39;s not that abnormal &amp; body aches and stiffness similar to a mild version of influenza. It appeared late in the day on Saturday, 3/27/21 and has continued since.

A 40-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, brand: Pfizer), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 24Mar2021 11:30 at age of 40-year-old (Lot Number: ER8733) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Facility of Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. Medical history included gout, anxiety, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, &#39;espoghutis&#39;. The patient did not have allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication within 2 weeks of vaccination included omeprazole; allopurinol; escitalopram. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 10Mar2021 11:30 at age of 40-year-old (Lot Number: En6206) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 02Apr2021, the patient had vivid/lucid dreaming with bright lights and unusual feelings as he initially fell asleep. He was able to wake himself up but remained in between sleep and awake. This was accompanied by light headiness a feeling that he would pass out or die and tingling and shaking throughout his body as he remained in a confused mental state while his wife called an ambulance. In 2021, his vitals were fine with occasionally elevated blood pressure and slight markings of dehydration ( during the day following his second dose he felt like he had a bad hangover). The ER doctor thought the most likely explanation is sometime of nocturnal panic attack with unknown trigger. He had not previously sufferer anything like it. The events were reported as non-serious. The adverse events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the adverse events which included: drugs to calm, fluids. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events light headiness, tingling and shaking throughout his body, confused mental state, nocturnal panic attack with unknown trigger, vivid/lucid dreaming with bright lights, elevated blood pressure, slight markings of dehydration, hangover were resolving.   Information on lot/batch number obtained. Further information is expected.

Consultation 1 Comments discussed with  RPh.  He will come to ER to obtain additional information from patient.  This is the hospital&#39;s first presumptive Pfizer vaccine reaction. ? Consultation 2 04/16/2021 15:41 ? Consultation 2 Comments discussed with Dr.  we discuss presentation.  he agrees pt will need monitoring with the persisting symptom/findings and the H/O COPD.  1617 Dr has been to ER and completed eval.  pt to be placed on 2nd floor med/tele for additional monitoring and treatment.  pt did have labs yesterday.    ? Decision to Admit Based On  1446 Based on his symptoms and presentation presumptive acute anaphylaxis to component of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  We will begin treatment with 0.3 mg epinephrine IM once as well as dexamethasone, famotidine, diphenhydramine IV. We will continue to monitor with cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  He does have slight wheezing but this may be related to his chronic COPD.  No respiratory distress at this time, but his symptoms seem to have been mildly progressive over the past hour (per his report).  I believe inclusion of the epi to be prudent based on his presentation. Additionally, I will inform the vaccination clinic of this reaction.  he agrees pt will benefit from continued monitoring and repeated IV antihistamine and IV steroid treatment.  Pt will need IVFluid for hydration as well.   Recheck: ? Recheck Recheck 1, Recheck 2, Recheck 3 ? Time 14:55 ? Recheck patient stable  patient improving with treatment ? Comments He is improving.

His pulse is 98?99 continues to have elevated blood pressure.  Pulse oximetry 98-100% on room air, normal.  Pharmacist will enter the reaction into the CDC/FDA/Pfizer database. Overall pt notes he feels tired (probably related to hydration &amp; benadryl).

Overall he is improving.  He notes he still has malaise and feels about the same with itching in his back and the sensation in his throat.  When I evaluate his back there is hyperemia/some macular rash that is in approximately the distribution of the trapezius muscle of the back this is where he notes he has the itching.  Additionally when I evaluate his throat there is still some presence of uvula edema.  There is no other angioedema.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

A 41-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. After taking his 2nd dose of the vaccine on 09Jan2021, the patient experienced a headache on 09Jan2021, then on 10Jan2021, also included a fever and chills and overall fatigue throughout the day on 10Jan2021. Although these were consistent with the educational pamphlet on the vaccine, we still wanted to report it. Patient was taking ibuprofen and paracetamol (TYLENOL) as needed. Temperature taken 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Event took place after use of product. The outcome of all the events was unknown.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                After 1st Pfizer shot I experienced the worst headache of my life 4-6 hours after the shot with localized pulsation in my right temporal region prior to the headache.   The headache persisted through the night and I could not sleep and did not decrease with over the counter medication, my pain was rated 9/10 to 10/10 in the same area the pulsation happened.  This headache continued for 4-6 hours at a severe level than for another 6-8 hours at a moderate to severe level.  I ended up checking in at the Emergency department that I worked at after my shift and got labs and CT scan, this was after my symptoms resolved.    I thought that I might have had a head bleed and wish I would have gotten my CT earlier when experiencing the symptoms.    I was not provided a vaccine disclosure sheet or any information on what to do if experience severe symptoms or what symptoms to expect.  I am upset that I was not provided guidance about what to expect and how to manage post vaccine symptoms, I would have gone into ED sooner with this information and feel I may have missed possible diagnosis due to lack of disclosure and guidance.

On Mon heart rate increased again. Went to Urgent Care and tested covid negative. On Wed 12/30, BP at 180/105. Went to ED and BP eventually went down to 145/95. Dr is speculating that since patient had high antibodies from covid infection in August and still high antibodies in October that all of this is a wild immune reaction triggered by the vaccine.

Medical history included OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) and PFO (patent foramen ovale). He had no known drug allergy. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]. On 10Jan2021, he began having mild headaches. On 11Jan2021 the headaches worsened to about 4/10 associated with myalgias, neck stiffness and a diffuse pruritic rash over his whole body. To return to work he had to go get tested so he went to the ER, got Flu A/B test, Covid antigen, then PCR test, a CBC, CMP, and coags (to rule out ITP). All tests were normal, Nasal Swab was negative. Treatment given was Normal saline bolus and ketorolac 30mg IV. The outcome of events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  ~~~

                                                Patient screened for first dose of Pfizer vaccine. He checked no history of allergies or reactions to medications or vaccines. In the initial screening he informed me he had a phobia of needles but this is usually with blood draws. He reported he should be fine with vaccinations. I inquired on previous reactions and he denied any allergic reaction just that he does not like them. I asked him how I can help give the vaccine. We had him look away and to think of a different situation. I asked him if he would like to know when I am administering or just use distraction. He chose to be informed when he would feel a slight poke. Vaccine was administered with no issues.  Within the minute following the vaccine patient started to feel dizzy. Hung his head a bit but was responsive. I requested staff assistance to help the situation including RN to prevent any episodes of syncope.  We provided water which he was able to drink. He was still seated and we suggested putting head between legs. This was not comfortable for him so we moved him to the floor. About 3-4 min in he began to sweat a bit more and appeared Pale. We obtained a BP and pulse. BP was 112/60 and pulse around 60.  When he felt hot, sweaty and appeared pale we all decided to call EMS to be cautious. He maintained BP, no SOB, did not lose conscious. EMS evaluated him, med list provided and vitals. He was on medications for anxiety.  They released him after about 30min and reported a panic attack and not related to the vaccine.  Patient walked out of the clinic with his partner and was stable. He is requesting 2nd dose of the vaccine. I informed him nurse would review and would have a plan for future injection.

These all occurred about 12 hours after the second shot and subsided around 36 hours after the second shot.  8.5 days after the second shot I had throat and chest pain.  This pain then continued and got worse to the point I went to the ER and was evaluated for potential heart attack.  After testing - results were that I did not have a heart attack.  I was still experiencing this pain, so the ER took a strep test.  This was also negative.  The diagnosis was &#34;pulled chest muscle&#34;.  I&#39;ve had pulled muscles, I know what those feel like and it sure didn&#39;t feel like what I experienced on the night of the 16th and the day of the 17th of Feb. 2021.

For the next 6 days experienced debilitating headaches, which led to nausea (because they were so severe). Elevated blood pressure also coupled with headaches.  I initially took Ibuprofen (which helped somewhat), whereas Tylenol did nothing. I also have a flexible ice pack that I placed over my head. That also helped a little. I went to the doctor on March 17th, but he was dismissive of the headaches being related to the vaccine. I have since been referred to  a neurologist (April 1st appointment).

                                                The patient is a 41 yo male with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis who experienced DVT and PE temporally related to Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine dose #2 receipt.  He is a Service Member and reported  high levels of baseline activity, including running 10 miles each Saturday. He received vaccine #1 25 JAN 21 (EN5318) without AE. He received dose #2 on 16 FEB 21, (EN6200). He experienced no immediate symptoms suggestive of IgE event. On day 1 he reports feeling cold, mild fatigue but no other symptoms. On day 2 he was baseline. On day 3 he noted numbness, tightness  and discomfort to his right  calf. On day 4 (Saturday), his usual long run day, he experienced dyspnea and lightheadedness after running 20-30 feet. He states he noted tightness in his calf and instead walked the track while his wife completed her run. He rested day 5.  Day 6 he noted significant edema to his calf, which he describes as double normal in size, and iced it. Day 7, he tried to schedule with PCP and based on triage was sent to ER. ER diagnosed R DVT and bilateral PE&#39;s. He was admitted overnight, started anticoagulation therapy. He saw hematology, and the workup was negative for other causes.

                                                I felt fine at first for the 15 minutes they held me for observation. But as I walked out to my car I quickly got heavy and tired and started to ache and have a headache. I had to rest in my car for a while before driving home. Once home I crashed immediately for around 4 hours in the middle of the day which is not like me. I had an important dinner meeting i had to attend for my livelihood. I thought I was feeling better but half way through Dinner  I started feeling bad again. Got to the point that I stopped eating and excused myself to get home and rest. Symptoms progressed rapidly. Unfortunately I was pulled over for a minor traffic stop and  tried to explain that I was having a bad reaction to the vaccine and needed to get home. They wouldn?t believe me  and torturously treated me like an OVI. I?m hoping that I can get some kind of documentation and or assistance. I have court on the 1st and it will be devastating if I am convicted. I was not intoxicated  and was not warned about the dangers of driving after the vaccine. Please call me. I need help

The patient got home and crashed 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day and woke up feeling really bad. The patient went to a very important dinner meeting that night. While the patient was at the meeting he went to the bathroom a few times and then excused himself because he felt so bad. The patient did not even finish one cocktail with dinner.

                                                On April 18 and 19, following my 2nd injection, I had very bad chills and could not get warm. I was nauseous although I did not vomit. On April 22, I began having severe sharp stabbing pains just to the right of my belly button. It felt like I was being stabbed with a very hot knife, and after about 15-90 seconds, it would go away. Anytime I reached for something, bent over, twisted, turned or tried to hug someone, I would get this same pain and it would double me over in pain.  On Monday April 26 at 7pm, I finally checked into the Emergency Room  at the direction of my Primary Doctor.  They did a bunch of blood work on me and sent me for a CT Scan of my abdomen.  All of the blood work came back in normal ranges, and the CT Scan showed my appendix was &#34;borderline&#34; according to the surgeon. They consulted with Dr and decided to admit me for a surgical consult and further examination.  They gave me fluids and morphine through an IV for the first 24 - 36 hrs, and then switched to Norco by mouth. I continued having pain throughout my stay.  On Thursday, April 29, they took me to surgery for &#34;exploratory surgery&#34; with the intention of removing my appendix and looking around to see if anything else stood out to them that would cause me this pain.  They stated my appendix had scar tissue on it and they removed it, but said they did not know if this would stop the pain I was having.  On Friday April 30, I was released from the hospital at approximately 6pm.  By 9pm on Friday, I began having those same sharp, stabbing, burning pains in my abdomen again, now to the right of my belly button again and further towards my right side.  I also had sharp burning pain in the inside of my upper right arm, between my bicep and tricep muscles.  This pain continued on through the weekend occurring more frequently and more severe.  On Monday morning at about 1:30am, I woke up with severe abdominal pains all over and went into the bathroom.  I had diarrhea and nausea and felt like I was going to vomit.  Between 1:30am and 7:30am, I went to the bathroom 6 times.  I went to work on Monday and continued having abdominal pains and diarrhea all day and night.  On Tuesday, I went to the bathroom a total of 17 times. On Wednesday, I saw my primary Dr.,  who examined my abdomen and pains.  He suggested I take immodium for the diarrhea and a supplement for muscle pain, as he felt this was the cause of my pain. On Wednesday, I went to the bathroom 21 times and was very nauseaus.  I started the Imodium and it had no effect on me whatsoever.  On Thursday, I had to call off work because I couldn&#39;t stop using the bathroom.  By 4pm, I had been to the bathroom 18 times.  I returned to the ER.  They took a stool sample and did an ultrasound in the ER.  They decided to admit me again for surgical consult and pain management.  On Friday, Dr ordered another ultrasound of my abdomen, specifically my gallbladder, kidney, and liver.  He also sent me for a CT Scan with contrast.  They completed a total lab workup of my blood.  All of these results came back normal, and nothing on the images showed anything wrong with my organs.   On Saturday May 8, Dr came to the hospital to examine me. He stated everything related to my GI was fine.  He asked if I have back pain, which I told him I do.  At this time, I was in extreme pain and I couldn&#39;t even touch my skin. Dr attempted to examine my abdomen, and just by placing his hand on my stomach, I screamed in pain.  He then put his hand behind my back and pushed a little, and it cause extreme pain in my abdomen.  At this time, Dr suggested that maybe the pain is caused by something going on in my back.  Maybe a pinched nerve or something.  He ordered an X-ray of my upper and lower spine.  Later that day, the results of the X-ray came back and showed there was nothing wrong with my spine.  With these results, Dr then ordered an MRI of my lumbar and thoracic spine.  On Sunday May 9 at 1030am, I was taken to radiology for an MRI.  The initial report shows that I do not have any pinched nerves and nothing notable that would cause this type of pain in my body.   As of now, no diagnosis or explanation for the pain I am experiencing. The pain is gradually getting worse and at times I am unable to move at all without extreme severe pain in my body.  At times, my right groin hurts and I am unable to stand on my feet, as it feels as if I have pulled a groin muscle.  The pain in my abdomen takes my breath away and feels like I am being set on fire in that area of my body.  The pain no longer goes away and is constant, but moves throughout my right side from my groin to my shoulder only.  I am not able to put my right arm behind my back because I get this pain in the back of my shoulder area.  This pain is only on my right side at this time.  So far, there is no explanation for this pain.  I never had anything like this until I got the vaccine.

Denies any fevers recorded at home. He feels like he has extra beats intermittently. Also reports some nausea, but denies vomiting or diarrhea. He has maintained good PO intake since symptoms started, but is worried he may be a bit dehydrated because he had a small AKI when he had covid back in March?.  Etiology of chest pains unclear, but given all of the above workup, unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac or pulmonary etiology.&#34;  He continued to have palpitations for the next week and had further EKG&#39;s don thru urgent care.

Medical history included COVID-19. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 18Dec2020, the patient had a strong headache on the left side, chills and overall body aches. On 05Jan2021, the patient had a strong headache but stronger on the forehead area, body aches, chills and on 05Jan2021, a fever of 103 degrees. This time the patient could not go to work due to these symptoms. No therapeutic measure was taken as a result of the events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 103  on 05Jan2021, sars-cov-2 test: positive on 2020 prior to vaccination. Clinical outcome of chills and pain was recovered on an unspecified date while for the other events was recovering.

                                                I was vaccinated on 1/2/2021 and developed oral parasthesias the day of the vaccination. On day 3 after the vaccine, I developed a severe headache with ?brain fog,? confusion, and hyperacusis. The headache has now persisted for 10 days and was severe enough that I missed several days of work this week as I was unable to carry out my clinical duties. I was seen in ED this past weekend and ultimately followed up with neurology after the headache had persisted for 7&#43; days. The working theory is that I may have developed aseptic meningitis as a side effect of the vaccine and I am currently on a steroid taper which has resulting in partial but significant improvement in my symptoms. I am back at work but still experiencing a mild headache and facial parasthesias. I did request a Covid test in ED 1 on 1/10/21 and tested negative.

I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

                                                About 72 hours after receiving the vaccination i was shivering uncontrollably on and off, breaking out in sweats on and off. Once i would start to feel better after sleeping 4-6 hours. I get out of bed thinking I was better, then another hour or so later the symptoms were back, so I would go back to bed shivering uncontrollably off and on again, sweating and uncomfortable until falling back to sleep.. This lasted for about 48 hours, which started 72 after receiving my vaccination.  No adverse symptoms the first 2 days following the vaccination. I got vaccinated on Tuesday, 1/19/21 - symptoms started Friday, 1/22/21 - Saturday, 1/23/21.  Sunday, 1/24/21 I finally felt normal again.

                                                I didn&#39;t have any symptoms all day, then I woke up at 1:30AM with my left arm (injection site) hurting and swollen and I was violently shaking.  Hypothermia.  Couldn&#39;t get warm.  It&#39;s like my body forgot  how to regulate temperature. I&#39;ve only ever experienced similar coming out of anesthesia after surgery.  Took wearing multiple layers of clothes AND multiple blankets just to stabilize my body temp.  It lasted for around 2-3 hours.  This wasn&#39;t normal &#34;chills&#34;.  This was whole-body shaking hypothermia.  Entire body sore afterwards from the involuntary shaking.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get an actual reading as anything to measure body temp was downstairs and I didn&#39;t want to risk falling.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

                                                Approximately 10 days following the vaccine, I began to feel mild weakness in my right hand and wrist.  The vaccine had been administered in my right arm.  Over the next two to three weeks I have noticed some additional weakness in both my right and left arms and also my neck muscles.  It is currently mild in nature, but a few days ago I had a little difficulty lifting myself out of bed.  I also notice the weakness after driving in the car for a while when my arms are in a somewhat horizontal position holding the steering wheel.  The weakness in my neck muscles is particularly noticeable in the evening and has caused some fatigue.    I have not noticed any significant weakness in the lower body nor have I experienced any additional symptoms.  Notably, I was scheduled to receive the second dose of the Pfizer  COVID19 vaccine on February 5, 2021, but have delayed it and rescheduled it to February 11, 2021

Felt better by 02/14/2021. Began feeling ill again on 02/17/2021, body aches, extreme fatigue, feeling very hot but not having a fever, nausea. It seemed to get better on about 02/21/2021, but then on 02/22/2021, all of the same feelings and symptoms came back and are still present today. I have reached out to my primary doctor to let him know and he suggested that I submit this information here as well.

Not as bad today but still under left eye, along left jaw and mouth, and parts of left cheek.   Had teledoc visit with doctor the evening of the shot and he diagnosed as Bell&#39;s Palsy.

On Wednesday, I noticed light bruising up and down my arms. Thursday morning around 10 AM, I started to have side effect - some so severe they must be documented. At 10 AM, I felt lightheaded and had brain fog. By noon my head was pounding with a headache followed by an upset stomach. At 2 PM things started getting bad and continued to worse. It was not the headache or stomach that need to be noted but a sudden and severe onset of depression and anxiety. - Depression like I have not felt in years when I was at my worst. Throughout the day the depression worsened and by 7 PM, I was unable to stop crying and was overwhelmed with anxiety and  PTSD panic attacks. While I have the training to understand  this is temporary, - I am very worried about what I?m feeling , because there was no warning or mention of this side effect. I have the resources needed for this but people that are more fragile need to prepare for the sudden o set of critical/ debilitating depression.

His fatigue was still there, but it has gotten a little better. He was normally very high energy, but he missed two classes and skipped his internship today. He doesn&#39;t feel like himself.

It would seem that patient had cerebritis from the shot since an unspecified date in 2021. Adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. There were no treatments received in response to the events reported. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered with lasting effects.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is too limited to make a meaningful medical assessment. Based on the available clinical data, the event encephalitis most likely represented an intercurrent medical condition not related to vaccination with BNT162B2. This case will be re-assessed when relevant follow-up information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

                                                The day after receiving the second vaccination, I began to have mild intermittent abdominal pain2-3/10.  The pain gradually increased, became more intense, and more constant.  Mild fever and chills started happening, and I took Ibuprofen.  By about 4 days after the vaccine, the abdominal pain was severe enough that I had some difficulty walking and I couldn?t sleep at night.  Pain was 6-8/10.  I went to the ER, and CT scan with IV contrast showed 18 mm appendicitis.  I underwent laparoscopic surgery and it was found to be perforated.  It was removed.  I am currently recovering in the hospital.  I received the vaccine as a health care provider at my hospital, specifically I am a practicing pediatrician physician for over 10 years.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

After several hours of sleep I got out of bed around 0600 and noticed severe body and joint ache and a headache. Once I began moving around I also noticed I would fatigue very quickly. Reminded me of how one feels when they get a good case of the Flu. As the day progressed all symptoms lessened in severity and I went to bed at about 20% of what I felt that morning. I woke the following morning and felt no residual symptoms.

                                                coughing quite a bit; seizure; his whole body feels sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 43-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3248) in right deltoid, on 11Jan2021 around 10:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was in high risk group, was living in senior facility and was disabled. Medical history included also ongoing hydrocephalus diagnosed when he was less than a year old, ongoing shunt (the first one when he was 11 months old, has had multiple revisions since then, the last in 2017), vagal nerve stimulator implantation ongoing from 2003 (for epilepsy; has had multiple since then, last one in 2015), ongoing hemiparesis since he was a baby and epilepsy (he was taking epilepsy drugs but it was well controlled). Concomitant medications included oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) ongoing from 2000, at 1800 mg daily (600 mg in the morning and 1200 mg at night), for epilepsy and levetiracetam (KEPPRA XR) ongoing from 2000, at 1500 mg twice daily (in the morning and at night), for epilepsy. He was on prior medications to these, since he was young. Over the years he has changed to newer and better medications. On 11Jan2021 around 8-9 PM the patient experienced seizure. The patient has not had a grand mal seizure in over 5 years. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, after the vaccine, his whole body felt sore. He was unsure if it was from the seizure or the vaccine. The reporter also noticed that the patient had been coughing quite a bit on 12Jan2021 morning. Events outcomes were unknown.

I also began having heartburn/indigestion.It has been 16 days since the first dose, and the loose stool and  heartburn/indigestion remain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (HCP [patient]). A 43-year-old male patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, lot number and exp date not reported), intramuscular (vaccine location: left arm) on 28Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. Medical history included gastric sleeve and surgery. The patient had no known allergies. Patient did not have Covid prior vaccination. There was no other medical history. There were no concomitant medications. There were no other vaccine/s within four weeks. No other medications in two weeks. The day after patient received the vaccine, she got the common side effects on Jan2021: chills, loose stool, and nausea. She also began having heartburn/indigestion (Jan2021). It had been 16 days since the first dose, and the loose stool and heartburn/indigestion remain. Not sure if it&#39;s because of having the gastric sleeve done years ago, or not, as the surgery changed her metabolism and the like. No treatment was provided. Nasal Swab on 11Jan2021 was negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

A 43-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer COVID 19; lot number: EL3247; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 17Jan2021 09:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included known penicillin allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (BACTRIM) but had allergies. The patient historically vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer COVID 19; lot number: EL0140; expiration date: unknown) at the age of 43-year-old via an unspecified route of administration right arm on 29Dec2020 10:00 AM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization.

The patient received the vaccine in a hospital but 36 hours after the vaccine (18Jan2021), the patient developed chills, body aches and low-grade temperature. Then 48 hours later, her left axilla has become very swollen and painful. The pain has subsided but remains mild and swelling persists. The area seems to show fluid accumulation in the subcutaneous tissue but no erythema or e/o [evidence of (pending confirmation)] abscess infection noted. It&#39;s now been present for 4 days. The patient received treatment which included NSAIDs. The patient had not been COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

                                                Severe spinning, nausea, vomiting, occurred at 2:15 a.m. while on duty, was transported to ER and diagnosed with Peripheral Vertigo. Follow ups with ENT, Neuro and PCP have continued with Vestibular Rehabilitation. While in ER, the MRI, MRA, CT, CT with Contrast was done, showed no signs of anything that could have caused this. Ironically tracking back, I received my 2nd Dose of the Pfyzer Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. and this occurred on February 13th at 2:15 a.m. I have not had any other issues before this nor any signs of damage to the nerve or ear that regularly affects Vertigo Patients per my Neuro and ENT. The incident took place 4 weeks and 2 days after the 2nd vaccine. 2 days after the 2nd dose, I experienced Low grade fever, chills, and body aches that lasted only 12 hours, but nothing with the 1st vaccine nor anything after the 2nd dose issue until the Vertigo.  I am unable to drive, conduct my job, which requires me to go to emergency calls and carry a Taser (CEW). I have been off work since this occurred and still not eligible to go back to work.

At approximately 8pm, 11 hours after injection, I began to experience a sore body and muscles.  Lastly, throughout the night I had sore muscles, joints, and minor chills.  These symptoms were moderate; however, I did not take any prescribed or over-the-counter medications to treat the symptoms as I did not want to interfere with the vaccine.  All symptoms subsided by mid-morning the next day.

Concomitant medication taken within two weeks of vaccination included hydrochlorothiazid. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took ibuprofen and experienced hypersensitivity. It was reported that the patient experienced headache in right back portion of head which started in PM on 05Mar2021. On 07Mar2021 the patient began experiencing facial paralysis in lips which progressed to the rest of right side of face. The patient went to the hospital emergency department. Bloodwork was normal. Computerized tomogram (CT) scan was noted as &#34;unremarkable&#34;. He was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy and prescribed Valtrex and Prednisone. On 10Mar2021 he was still experiencing facial paralysis and headache. The clinical outcome of the events was not recovered.

Severe myalgias - in the epigastric cisternal area and in the back of my shoulder blades. 36 hours later - low grade temperature. At 48 hours I felt normal. Eye - 10 days later (vaccine) - I noticed a visual deficit in the left eye along with a line and the following day - on the 17th, I saw my ophthalmologist - left branch retinal vein occlusion.  Since then I&#39;ve had an Forestine Angiogram:  and a video of my retina - branch retina arterial occlusion - so they are having trouble telling the difference between the two. I still am being followed for my eye. They did a carotid ultrasound - my carotids are fine. I am due to get an echo cardiogram. I am taking baby aspirin mg for now - not sure if it&#39;s helping or not. It takes a year and a half to go away.

A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                As soon as I received the shot and went into the waiting area, I experienced a tingling sensation down my right arm where the injection was administered. Throughout the 15 minutes the sensation began to radiate throughout my body and extremities. I waited about 20 minutes before deciding to leave the facility and proceed with my afternoon.  Once I got home, I experienced chills, which I read on the pamphlet was an expected side effect. Both hands and feet were cold and I put on additional layers and lied on the couch and rested. During that time I began to notice the tingling sensation/paresthesia predominantly in the injected (right) arm, but also sporadically in other parts of my body including thigh (front/back), left arm, elbow, back, torso, neck, head, wrists, buttocks, etc. This sensation continued as I prepared for bed and continues as of this writing.  It&#39;s difficult to say whether the sensation is getting better or worse, but it is consistent best described as someone pricking you every so often.

I had trouble getting warm and had to utilize multiple blankets to gain heat, which is not normal.  I was very warm and most likely developed a fever.  I did not eat until 2 PM that day and the started feeling better later that night.  I was forced to miss work to recover.  I returned to work today, 1/28 but I remain tired and a little lethargic.

                                                Little muscle twitches; felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines; Low grade fever; Muscle soreness; Muscle tiredness; Hands were a little shaky; Very diaphoretic; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other Nurse. This 44-year-old Nurse (Patient) reported that he received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown) at single dose for vaccination in Jan2021 around 9:45am. Relevant medical history included ongoing Mild shrimp allergy  and ongoing Hypertension. Relevant concomitant drugs included amlodipine at 10 mg once daily for Hypertension since Feb2020 and ongoing. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None.  Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was None. The patient was administered the COVID Vaccine around 9:45am; about 10 minutes later he had onset of little muscle twitches on the left side of his body that started in the calf then the glute, then the quadricep, then the bicep and then just started bouncing around everywhere on left side. Approximately a half an hour after that those little muscle twitches started on the right side of his body. Now the little muscle twitches are just everywhere; his hand, his heel, right now as he is speaking he is having the little muscle twitches in his heel; This event has been ongoing since onset; but changed today around 5:00am when he felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines which is probably impossible, but it feels like it is not just muscular now, like it is happening in his intestines which concerns him. The little muscle twitches do not hurt, he thinks that is probably why he has waited a week to call; but the fact that they are ongoing and changed today, worsened is unsettling. He reported since that first dose of COVID Vaccine was administered he has also had low grade fever; muscle soreness; muscle tiredness. He reported that a rapid response team was called immediately because of the initial reaction he had. Later that day his hands were a little shaky, he got very diaphoretic and the nurses on the unit of the hospital said he almost fell which he does not recall at all; in response to those events he was taken to the emergency department where they did a complete workup including labs: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), checked his heart and everything was fine; no notable results from any of those tests. The patient was not admitted to the hospital; under observation in emergency room only. Outcome of events Little muscle twitches, Low grade fever, Muscle soreness and Muscle soreness was not resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 44-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at a single dose on the left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 28Dec2020. Since receiving the vaccine, he has experienced multiple side effects at varying time points: pain at injection site left shoulder (experienced pain first day of receiving vaccine on 28Dec2020 and couple of days after fever (unspecified date) resolved (on an unspecified date); he was currently experiencing intermittent minimal pain especially when he wakes up; feels something is different; fever (experienced 08Jan2021); fatigue (developed 07Jan2021). He went to the ER on 08Jan2021 when he developed fever, nausea and shortness of breath which also resolved that day. When he went to ER, his CRP was up a little at 1.1. His PCR and antigen test was negative at that time (08Jan2021); a retest of PCR done 5 days after sxs started (unclear of time window) was negative. He was concerned that he had the fever many days after the vaccine. HCP was asking if any cases of fever and fatigue reported after 7 days (around the 10 day mark) of receiving the first dose. He stated that he is planning on taking the second dose. The patient is a physician calling about the Pfizer covid vaccine. He received his first dose on 28Dec2020. He had a little bit of pain in his left arm on same day, but it went away. About 10 days later, 07Jan2021, he had fever and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, he went to the ER with a temp of 101. He had tachycardia, nausea and shortness of breath. He was not admitted, stated his fever was controlled and his breathing was better. His oxygen was 100% and everything was ok and he was sent home. In the ER he had xrays and labs and everything was ok, except his CRP was a bit up. In the ER he had an antigen and pcr covid test (08Jan2021) and they both came back negative. About 4 or 5 days after the symptoms started, he had an outpatient repeat pcr test and nucleic acid rapid test (unspecified dates) and they both came back negative. He is on his way to get his second dose and he is asking if the symptoms could be side effects from the vaccine. Outcome the event fever was recovered on an unspecified date. Outcome of nausea and shortness of breath was recovered on 08Jan2021, while outcome of pain at injection site left shoulder was recovered on 28Dec2020. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 44-years-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Feb2021 17:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at hospital. Medical history included coronary artery disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unknown date for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not have covid before vaccination. The patient experienced small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. These events were serious as life threatening, disability and requiring hospitalization from 21Feb2021 till 23Feb2021 at 14:00. On 20Feb2021 07:00 the patient experienced headache, chill, running nose, shortness of breath with outcome of recovering. The patient experienced also pains in chest on 21Feb2021 11:00 with outcome of recovering and injection location had redness, hardness on an unspecified date with outcome of recovering. Clinical course was as follows. 19Feb2021-5:45pm the patient went to receive vaccine shot. 20Feb2021 the patient had headache, chill, runny nose, and shortness of breath. 21Feb2021 11am still had shortness of breath and pains in chest. Went to clinic had a rapid Covid test come back negative, pain increased and he went to emergency room. The patient was admitted to the hospital with small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues. Inflammatory response seems to possibly triggered possible underlying issue of minor heart disease. Then induced heart attack and myocardial issue. The patient would gladly be admitted to a clinic for observation and testing to assist Pfizer in understanding this unfortunate situation. The injection location had redness, hardness. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment due to the event which included multiple lab tests, Angiogram, CR scan and pain medicine.

I then took 1 tablet of Claritin in order to counter the reaction. I sat down outdoors, removed my mask and jacket so I could breathe better. I also ate a sandwich since I thought maybe I felt dizzy because I didn&#39;t eat a full breakfast. I stayed outdoors sitting down for 2 hours before getting up. I felt better after about 1 to 1.5 hours. However, as of March 6, 2021, sometimes I have a drowsy feeling like I&#39;m on cold medication. However, I did not take any medication today. Also, for the 1st COVID vaccine I took on 11 Feb 2021, I took 1 tablet of Benadryl, which countered the allergic reaction which is why I did not have symptoms to report for the 1st dose.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

                                                Starting from the first night after the vaccination and each and every night after that to date of this form completion, I have had extremely interrupted sleep.  I have woken up several times in the middle of the night (i.e., 2 am, 4 am, etc..). Each time I have woken up and felt wide awake and difficulty going back to sleep.  As a consequence each of the following days after this poor sleep I have been in extreme fatigue and not able to function properly.  I do not have any other notable side effects.  No fever or major headaches.  This disturbed sleep which coincidentally started right after the vaccination is highly concerning for me, especially since it has happened on 4 consecutive nights.  This has not happened to me before.  In the past even if I woke up in the middle of the night, I would fall back asleep relatively quickly.  Furthermore, it has not been the case of this type of lack of sleep for this many consecutive nights. Another observation is that my feeling of hunger seems to have increased for some reason.  Even in the middle of the night when I wake up I have felt great hunger and then starting in the morning that hunger continues.  This is more hunger than normal for me.  My diet and eating patterns have not changed compared to what it was before getting the first dose of the vaccination. Given that today is Martin Luther King Day and a Holiday my PCP is closed, so could not make an appointment or report this to her.  I will call my PCP again tomorrow, 01/19/21. If this disturbed sleep continues, then I am sure how I can properly function during a normal work day on the job. Given all the above I am also concerned about the second dose of the vaccination and what side effects that may result in.

                                                Received  second dose of  Pfizer COVID vaccination on January 9, 2021. At the time of the vaccination he experienced discomfort of  left deltoid (site of injection) as well as paresthesia at the injection site. He also experienced systemic symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias for 24 to 36 hours. Over the course of the next several days he experienced continued significant numbness and weakness in left upper extremity, specifically in left deltoid muscle. By Sunday 1/17/2021 the significant left deltoid weakness and numbness persisted, specifically not being able to lift his arm greater than 45 degrees using his deltoid. He contacted health on 1/17/2021. On 1/19/2021 he had a consultation with a physician. Based upon his clinical examination, and symptom complex, physician does not believe that this is a cervical spine issue but rather a local nerve injury related to the injection site. He was prescribed a steroid taper. Unclear whether this is temporary or permanent issue.

The rest of me felt like I had a mild case of the flu.  Aches and fatigue all over, with some chills.   I have been training for a half marathon, and this through off my training due to knee pain.    I also had diarrhea that has lasted through Saturday.   The first day after was the worst, and things have improved each day since.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN).

The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient experienced a headache within 4 hours of vaccination. Took recommended dose of Tylenol.  4 hours after that (8 hours after vaccination) he was still experiencing extreme headache and also vomiting and took another dose of Tylenol.  Was still feeling poor at 1am but coherent and talking, not thinking  that it was serious enough to warrant going to hospital, as he believed it was just a bad headache and the vomiting was from the headache.  At 6am, he was found blue/dead in his bed.

Caller states he has an appointment with a neurologist and he&#39;s trying to get it moved up. Caller states his doctor wants to do a lumbar puncture to rule out MS or Parkinson&#39;s that sort of thing. Caller states but at this point they are trying to rule things out. Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

Also had myalgias this all lasted approximately 2 hours but he was able to get to bed and fall asleep.  Woke up this morning feeling better but still with some chills but noticed some tenderness and redness in his right upper mid thigh.  This got progressively worse.  Continues to have chills but improving.    ED work-up including CBC unremarkable, CMP with mild hyponatremia and hypokalemia of 134 and 3.4 respectively.  ED drew blood cultures and then started vancomycin.  Vitals normal and stable in ED.  Admitted to hospital.  Provider notes on 2nd day of admission as follows.  Cellulitis and abscess of the right medial thigh likely secondary to a skin tag tear which introduced infection.  Patient currently is on broad-spectrum antibiotics in the form of doxycycline and vancomycin.  Unfortunately, the patient has been eating just ate lunch and also has been getting Lovenox.  He is not going to tolerate a bedside incision and drainage.  We will plan on proceeding to the operating room tomorrow for quick I&amp;D and cultures.  Procedures been explained.  The wound will need to be packed afterwards and ultimately healed in.  Patient seems understand plan and we will proceed accordingly

I felt some fatigue and chills through Friday, but woke up Saturday the 23rd feeling normal, except for a rash developing on my neck and the left side of my head. By Sunday, it spread, so I made a virtual appointment. Yesterday, it got worse, so I made an appointment with my primary care and saw him in the afternoon. Apparently, I was his second patient yesterday with the same diagnosis: shingles trigglered by the COVID - 19 vaccine.&#34;

                                                Approximately 10 hours after receiving my second COVID shot and right before I went to bed at 10pm I started getting chills.  My symptoms worsened as the night went on, I was shaking and could not get warm.  I also had a very bad headache and I had trouble lifting myself up.  At about 3am I started sweating and feeling feverish.  I got out of bed to take Tylenol and drink water, and had trouble walking and I was breathing heavy.   At 6am I decided to take a hot bath with Epsom salts to help with my aches and headache.  When I got out of the bath I felt very dizzy and fatigued and need assistance from my wife to get back in bed.  At about 9am I started feeling better.  I sat myself up and ate apples and salty tortilla chips and drank lots of water.  By 1pm I was able to walk without difficulty and I felt better with only a mild headache.

As I was on the phone (to report the first one to my caregiver) when the second hit, I inadvertently punched myself rapidly and repeatedly in the right side of my head, with the phone handset functioning as an impromptu bludgeon, leaving bruises reminiscent of the victim of a fist fight.  Also at the time I had a strong headache, cold chills, a 102 degree Fahrenheit fever and body aches.  None of which persisted beyond noon.

                                                experienced significant shortness of breath, heavy wheezing, and coughing on the weekend of 2/6/2021. Slight wheezing had been ongoing for months (difficulty breathing in January of 2020 when diagnosed with influenza A and intermittent slight wheezing continued throughout the year). Symptoms became worse throughout the weekend. I did continue my normal routine (taking trash to the dump, helped move a heavy tank out of a walkout basement, and moving  twelve 40 pound bags of wood pellets from store into truck then from truck into my home on day of hospitalization) Hospitalized on 2/7/2021

                                                On December 17, 2020, my husband, received his first BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

At 06:00 (Friday), I woke with a massive pressure headache, malaise, very sore left arm (where the injection was), and a fever of 100.2. Tylenol at 06:20 seems to have broken fever, still feel very rundown and the headache is debilitating.  It is 10:00 hrs. as I fill this out. The Tylenol made no difference to the headache.

                                                Starting about 5-6 hours after the shot I developed severe bloating, cramping and gassy-ness, literally constant burping.  My stomach has been in constant pain.  I?ve also had a slight fever and a very sore arm.  Tylenol and rest has worked for the fever and arm, and I&#39;ve had some addition body aches.  Not sure how much is due to being in bed for an extended period.  Also on Friday (about 24 hrs after getting the shot I was pretty fatigued.  I just woke up from 13 hours of sleeping.  But the stomach cramps/pains was severe and prompted me to try to find a way to report it, especially since it doesn&#39;t seem to be too common.  It&#39;s been really bad.

Went and got tested for COVID on 1/15/21 and tested positive. Took oral steroids and azythromycin antibiotics but did not help. Was hospitalized with Covid Pneumonia on 1/19/21 and received steroids and Remdesivir. Was released from the hospital on 1/27/21. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGHT THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN EMPHASIS MADE FOR PEOPLE TO GET TESTED FOR COVID BEFORE GETTING THE VACCINE.  I WAS THE 9TH PERSON AT THE HOSPITAL WITH THE SAME ISSUE.

                                                Sore arm; Muscle cramps all over the body; Sugar was very high; Dehydrated; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 46-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 27Feb2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack (at the age of 39) and had couple of stents (and the things done) later after that, and Lyme disease (past this Summer). The patient was taking several concomitant medications (unspecified). The patient&#39;s mother was calling for her son (patient) as he works out on the road, but he has had a heart attack at 39 years old and has had some other problems. The patient got his first Pfizer shot and about 2 to 3 days later while he was working, he first just had the sore arm on 03Mar2021. The patient worked in fiber glass repair on pools and it was very warm, and he started having muscle cramps all over the body on 03Mar2021. The patient ended up in the hospital on 03Mar2021 and his sugar was very high, and he was dehydrated. As treatment taken for the events, they gave him fluids through an IV and they gave him metformin medication 500 mg. The patient underwent laboratory tests and procedures (his doctor did the laboratory work), and they did laboratory work at the hospital where he went. It was clarified that they just did blood work on 03Mar2021, but the patient&#39;s mother didn&#39;t know what it was. The patient was just held for observation and was out the next day (04Mar2021). That was only the first shot, so the patient was really afraid to get the second shot one. The patient&#39;s mother told him she will try to find out something about it. patient&#39;s mother looked up the side effects and she did not see that as a side effect. At the time of reporting, the patient still had cramps once in a while. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Muscle cramps all over the body&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

I was perfectly healthy before the shot.. then several days after developed an ache in my right abdomen, fatigue and constant ringing in ears that will not go away.  I&#39;m also having a very hard time sleeping.. sometimes only being able to get 2 or 3 hours a night regardless of how tired I am.  I&#39;m very disappointed and not sure if I should get the second shot or not given how I&#39;m feeling now.  Before the shot I was perfectly healthy.  I eat well, exercise and have never in my life experienced tinnitus or any type of hearing problem.  This shot was the ONLY thing that could have caused this.  I&#39;m not sure what to do next or if I should get the second shot which could make it worse.  I&#39;m very worried because the ringing and aches have been constant for 10 days..  some days worse than others.

                                                a 46-year-old male with no known past medical history who initially presented complaining of headache and neck stiffness with onset the morning of 04/03/2021.  The patient states that his headache was initially gradual in onset and eventually decreased in severity on 4/5 however, on 04/06 after a day at the beach the patient developed a severe headache with rapid onset that he described as the worst headache in his life.  He did try to medicate himself at home with 600-800 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hr with minimal decrease in his headache pain.  As result he presented to  urgent care for initial evaluation who sent him to the emergency department for possible brain bleed.  On arrival to the emergency department the patient had a head CT which showed trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basilar cisterns likely due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm.  He was transferred to  for continued workup of the subarachnoid hemorrhage with CTA and possible IR intervention.  At time my evaluation patient was resting comfortably in the bed.  He continued to complain of severe headache and neck stiffness.  He additionally notes that light and loud sounds make his headache worse.  He denied any focal weakness, paresthesia&#39;s, numbness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or any other concerning neuro symptoms.  Patient was hypertensive during my evaluation despite being on a Cardene drip.  Patient&#39;s mother was at bedside and was able to assist with history.

                                                On March 25, 8 days after the vaccine shot in my left arm, I began experiencing intense pain on the left side of my neck and head. By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

A 46-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm (shoulder) on 12Mar2021 10:07 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient was not sick at time of vaccination. The patient reported that on 12Mar2021, he has been feeling the regular pain feeling, a headache, muscle pain before, it comes and goes. However, he said that the last few days (2021), there had been, by his calf muscle in the back there, they&#39;ve been tightening, like stiffening up on him when he&#39;s sleeping. His calf feels tight, stiff, it feels like dead weight. It wakes him up at times. He also reported pain running up the right arm up to the shoulder on unknown date in 2021. He was just curious in terms of what that might be. He asked if someone can tell him if it is a blood clot in the back of his calf. The headache went away after 2-3 days. He also reported that his eyes also hurt a little bit and was the same time frame as the headache (onset date reported as 12Apr2021: after the second dose, pending clarification).

Narrative:  12/21 employee received vaccine at 0930 - later in the afternoon he noted tachycardia to about 100. He was watching the rate on his Apple watch. The highest rate was 130. His only other symptom was fatigue which was bad enough on 12/22 that he had to go home. He saw his PCP on 12/22 for the tachycardia who ordered labs which were all normal. He is a resident so he asked anesthesia to do an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia. On 12/23 his heart rate average went down to 100. Today (12-28) his resting heart rate is 70-80 which is his baseline. He has not had recurrence of the tachycardia since 12/23. He also reports he had soreness at the injection site and myalgias both of which have since resolved.

                                                Approximately 13 hours after receiving the vaccine I became overwhelmingly tired. Went to get ready for bed by first going into the bathroom. While getting ready I passed out (micturation syncope). Hit my head on the floor and sustained a concussion. I am still experiencing post concussive symptoms but this is to be expected as it has been less than a week.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

                                                Patient complained of feeling light-headed and a little dizzy at 10 minutes post-administration.  Pulse-oximetry applied revealed normal spO2, but tachycardia to 140bpm (this patient&#39;s resting HR is approximately 55-65).  Apple Watch data confirmed rapid increase in HR at that moment.  BP increased from normal baseline to about 150-160 SBP.  No chest pain reported.  No signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis (rash, wheezing, etc.).  HR gradually recovered to normal levels within 30 minutes and patient was released after 60 min observation.  Patient reported generalized fatigue in weeks following injection.   Nineteen (19) days after injection, patient developed unprovoked resting tachycardia to approximately 180bpm (following some moderate weigh-lifting exercise).  Symptoms did no resolve sufficiently and patient was transported by EMS to ER for evaluation

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

                                                I &#39;had Covid&#39; beginning Saturday before Thanksgiving.  During that period, I had two tests, both from facility, and both tests came back negative. Symptoms included fever 102-103 for 12 days. No appetite (didn&#39;t eat for that duration). Headache. Excessive sweating. Extreme shallow breath. Hyperventilation. Body ache. No loss of smell or taste. No nausea. No mucus response.  Since that time, I have experienced extreme fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, headache.  After the first shot, those three symptoms increased.  With the second shot, I had fever 99.5-101 from Tuesday though Saturday. Nausea, headache, body ache, weakness, shortness of breath. It felt 85% similar in symptom and intensity as when I &#39;had Covid&#39;.   The greatest difference is the nausea. When I &#39;had Covid&#39; there was no nausea and I did not throw up.

Approximately 18 hours after the vaccine: I experienced chills, elevated temperature (99 to 100 degrees F), headaches, fatigue. Approximately 42 hours after the vaccine: the chills, elevated temp, headaches, and fatigue were gone, but I had a armpit aching on the left side. The armpit ache faded over the next 24 hours.  Today is 7 days post vaccine and I still have periodic tingling/numbing/cool sensation on the pinky and ring fingers on my left hand.

                                                Within a half hour, I felt dizzy and light headed. in 45 minutes - I could barely stay awake. I had to stop driving. Within two hours, I had a bad headache. I became slightly agitated that day. The headache lasted throughout the day - I took Ibuprofen but that didn&#39;t help much. Sunday, the headache was still there. It wasn&#39;t a migraine; but intense. I was agitated.  My agitation level grew and my irritability grew and the headache I had the whole day. Sunday evening about 7 pm the agitation and irritability got very intense - I was having impulse control issues with it. I don&#39;t have anger issues but I wanted to yell at TV or throw my phone. From 8- midnight, I was lethargic and fatigued - I didn&#39;t have the energy to roll over;: had extreme anxiety I was sweating and having weird thoughts like harming my animals and harming myself; my  mind was racing and then I would get really depressed. Until about midnight, I have had past struggles with anxiety and depression - there had been a past feeling like this - but it was really extreme - it was worse night of my life. Lasted four hours, and finally I slept for about one hour. I remember thinking, I finally can take a breath. My racing thoughts were gone and sweating was gone. The irritability had subsided enough that I could try to gain control of my thoughts again. I had really bad nightmares the rest of that night; I was confused _ I didn&#39;t know where I was - confused about that - occurred about three different times until I got up at 5:30 am for work. To summarize, for the next week, I had moments of anxiety and depression. I had mental fog. I played pro football - and I had post concussion syndrome. It was very identifiable to what I had had. So this was occurring in moments - forgetful; depressed; and random moments of anxiety - like I was going to go play football again. 7-10 days - it got a little better each day. Ten days it took to subside. I still exercised and taking extra fluids to get back to my normal.  Exercised help. No fever occurred. With COVID - I had had a sense of anxiety and depression and some mental fog when I had COVID I didn&#39;t have it to this extreme.  Did not get the second dose.

The day after vaccination,  patient was complaining of fatigue with subjective fevers and rigors with associated headache and neck stiffness and on the day of presentation he complained of increased fatigue and general malaise for which he left work early and was ultimately found poorly responsive in his private vehicle with concern for possible seizure activity.  He was brought to ER by ambulance.  He reported numbness in hands and legs, rigidity, and an episode of urinary incontinence.  He was started on empiric antibiotics for possible CNS infection, lumbar puncture completed. Found to have acellular CSF and antibiotics were discontinued.  Patient remains in hospital at this time with course complicated by post-LP headache.

ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.  Completed 5 day course of high dose steroids, 6 days of IVIG and on ongoing PLEX. Neurological improvement noted 3/25

                                                I had right sided headache for the first two days, then resolved.  The right sided headaches recurred along with right tongue numbness initially on 12/29/2020.  The symptoms worsen on 12/31/2020 and severe on 1/1/2021.  I was initially started on Valtrex thinking it maybe due to shingles but soon with the right sided facial paralysis, it was obvious it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and was started on steriods on 1/1/21 and also received acupuncture treatment on 1/2/21 which significant help improve the symptoms.  I still have some residual weakness of the right eye with some tearing and mouth weakness.

                                                After the injection my arm got really sore.  I began to feel really tired and begin to have chills and shakes.  I started having diarreah and began throwing up. I had  a sever headache and body aches which all symptoms lasted for about 3 days and I felt so bad so on Wed 12/30 I went to Urgent Care and was given fluids which did make me begin to feel a little better. On Monday I was sent for a COVID test which was negative.  On Friday 1/1 i was finally able to return back to work.

I left the hospital, start driving, and suddenly felt that my right arm was heavy, numb, with a tingling sensation. I stopped the car and called the nurse and I was told that it will go away, and I can take a tylenol/motrin. It improved over the next hour and I felt it resolved a few days later but then it returned on 1/18 but not to the same extent, and I also felt intermittent tingling and numbing in my right foot. I also experienced intermittent episodes of fast heartbeats and missing heartbeats since the vaccine almost daily. I was fatigued and extremely thirsty for 3 days but that resolved completely.

                                                I received the first dose of Pfizer EK5730 at 18:07 on 12-30-2020.  For the first day my arm was a bit sore but nothing to bad.  The next few days 48-72 hours later I started to have many more  symptoms, some minor to sever including joint pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.  lesser included some nauseas.   The joint pain was so bad at one point i had to pull over while driving.  on 1-2-21.  as of writing this now 14 days out I still have some joint pain especially in my arms.  No other symptoms of note.   I would add that I tested positive for COVID -19 on 10-18-2020 and was not released from quarantine until 11-5-20  I did seek treatment during this time through by calling my Dr. did not require any hospitalization.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

                                                The shot was administered at a vertical position rather than a horizontal position.  The physician asked me to wait 30minutes after the vaccine.  I did  experience sweats, fever and headaches.  I pre medicated myself with Benadryl 25mg an hour in a half before the injection.  My BP readings were 130/90.  I discussed with my physician i was doing a daily log on my BP. My systolic  BP reading were between the 90-100.  I was prescribed Losartan 25mg. After post 24 hours after the injection it dissipated the next day.

Felt fine Monday morning. Monday about 11 am began to feel tightness in chest, thought it was bad heartburn. Pain kept me awake Monday night, and continued into Tuesday morning. Called the doctor, was sent to urgent care. Urgent care detected elevated tritonin and had me transported to the emergency room. Elevated heart rate and rising tritonin levels had me admitted to the hospital. Given heperin and a beta-blocker, given a CT scan, and monitored over night. On Wednesday had a echocardiogram and then a heart catherter and imaging, which showed a healthy heart, no plaque, no blockages. Tritonin levels and heart rate returned to normal. Released from hospital on evening of 3/10.

                                                I received my first Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination at 1:00 PM on March 21, 2021.  I was fine all day, but near bedtime felt like something was beginning to happen.  My upper left arm was also sore from the injection.  I fell asleep at 11:30 PM and awoke at 1:00 AM with body aches and chills.  I was never able to get back asleep the entire night.  The following morning, March 22, I had body aches, chills, shaking and a terrible headache all day.  All of these symptoms continued throughout the day and evening.  I stayed hydrated with Gatorade and Sprite and ate very light foods.  By the next morning, March 23, the headache was gone, but still have a little remaining of the body aches.  No more chills or shaking.  Moving slow still, but getting better.

                                                Background, I had Covid back at the end of May/beginning of June with 1 week of constant fevers (with 500mg tylenol q6), shortness of breath, fatigue, but no real cough. O2 sats somtimes in low 90&#39;s . I am one of the radiology faculty at the hospital I work at. Received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday Dec 18 at about 21:30. After the injection, I had moderate pain at the site of injection about 6 hours later, not unexpected. However, the next evening, I was feeling fatigued and went to bed at about 7 p.m. For the next three hours, I felt chills and finally at about 10 p.m. I took my temp after I felt that my fever had &#34;broke&#34; and temp was 101.9. Used a finger pulse ox just to make sure sats were ok, they were at 97%, but unexpectedly, resting heart rate was 130 bpm. I took some tylenol and called the ER, and they suggested calling the covid hotline pager and coming in if I did not improve. I called the hotline pager, and we discussed things and eventually decided that I should go to the ER as temp remained at 101.6. By the time I reached the ER, my temp was down to 100.8, but pulse still 122 (EKG with no other abnormalities) and BP was 165/100. I had no other symptoms to account another infection. Over the next two hours, vitals became more normal with HR down to 95 to 100, and BP down to 145/85 or so without any other intervention.  Sunday, still with some mild low grade temps of 99.8, but heart rate at 85 to 90 (I&#39;m usually at about 80).   In the ER, we came to the conclusion that my body mounted a significant immune response to the production of antigens after processing the mRNA given the lack of alternative diagnosis and the improvement of sx without any other intervention besides the 500 mg of tylenol I took before coming in.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EL0142) intramuscularly at right shoulder approximately at 17:30 on 29Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity (a little over weight but he is fit). The patient had COVID in the end of Apr2020. The patient had no family medical history and had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no concomitant medication. The second day of the vaccination, the patient called to report body aches, headache, chills, low grade temperature. As he reported, he just woke up and was walking around feeling like he had 1000 pounds on his back and felt like crap. The body aches started in his shoulder and currently all over his neck, back and whole body aches. Chills started last night (vaccination night). He was just trying to get to sleep and had to put an extra sweatshirt on last night. He did not check his temperature until he got up and it was 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit. He was not able to provide a start date for the temperature. &#34;Body aches, headache between, chills between, low grade temperature (unspecified start date), feels like crap&#34; were considered developing between 24:00-01:00. He stated that they were all medically significant and he needs a day to recover hopefully. He just felt like he was hit by a truck. The patient had not visited physician or went to ER yet. The outcome of low grade temperature was unknown, chills was resolving and all other events did not resolve at the time of reporting.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events vaccination site pain, headache, chills, and pyrexia were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. The association between the other reported events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded based on temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The pain and slight numbness is present when I awake, but gets worse throughout the day.  Some evenings there is considerable discomfort.

It would randomly come and go from literally every area of my body and this was so pronounced it was hard to fall asleep that night.  Thur 1/21.  Leg pain gone but still week and tired.  Pins and needles sensation better but not gone.   Friday 1/22 same as 1/21 Saturday 1/21 same as 1/21.  Tried to do a little work around the house and was exhausted.   Pins and needle sensation remains the same.

                                                On Dec 22, I had my Pfizer vaccine. I only had some injection site sore/pain until 5 days later when I started to have papular rash and vesicles in the areas around the injection site. The involved area got extensive from shoulder to thumb from day 6 to day 12. The rash is only limited to the arm receiving the vaccine injection. Then I have low fever and weakness for two days. I just started to feel better this morning (post injection day 14).  I attached photos of my arm to show the rash. Confirmed by dermatologist as VZV positive on 1/5/2021. They did a biopsy and viral testing.

But then 8 days after the 2nd dose, same side effects occurred again but worse.  Was out of commission for two and a half days before feeling better.  Had bad headache and body aches I couldn&#39;t relieve with Advil or Tylenol.  Also my head broke out with a bunch of painful acne on the left side.  This is still slowly resolving, the body aches/ chills resolved after 72 hours.

He also complained that despite his protest, the person who administered the shot insisted to inject on his shoulder joint.  He developed a bigger-than-quarter-size bruise on his right inner arm the next day. He was feeling tired the following days. On May 4 around 3:30, I heard he was making loud noises. I came to his side immediately. At the time I thought he was making louder than usual snores. I nudged him gently but he didn&#39;t respond.  After about 15 seconds, the sound stopped, and he had no breath. I then called 911 within 10 seconds, tried to do CPR on him. It took EMS 6 minutes to arrive even though we live very close to a fire station in a well-accessed urban area. EMS worked on him for about 30 minutes before transported him to hospital. They continued to work on him for a while. He never regained breath.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 50-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Dec2020, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. On 17Dec2020 patient got sick; 2 weeks of on and off fever and unproductive cough. In Dec2020 the patient also experienced lost sense of taste and smell. On 20Dec2020 the patient underwent COVID-19 rapid POC test and was found positive. The events required emergency room visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with Tylenol 650 every 4 hours. The events recovered on unspecified date except unproductive cough and sore throat that were recovering.   The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The association between the event lack of effect (COVID-19 rapid POC test) with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

                                                Date these symptoms started was 1/27/2021:  About 12 hours after injection, developed fatigue and slight nausea as expected.  Oral temperature 98.0.  Commuted to work without issue. ~ 1400: As day progressed, nausea subsided, but fatigue grew more profound and developed pain in the right subscapular area with exertional shortness of breath walking any length of time. (Injection of initial and second doses were both in right deltoid). 1540 - 1800: Fatigue increased, developed a burning/tearing pain with every yawn and deep breath from the top of my trachea into both left and right mainstem bronchi and radiated to right arm.  It literally felt like someone was trying to tear out my bronchial tree with each breath. 1800: Arrived home and medicated self-medicated with Motrin 400mg. 1800 -2030: rested at home with still some breathing pain, no shortness of breath, but incredibly tired. 2045: Went to bed and slept for the next 12.5 hours without any issued during the night. 0800: Woke up nearly all symptoms were gone, only some minor residual fatigue.  No breathing pain, no nausea, no subscapular pain. I did not seek medical attention for symptoms, nor did I contact my provider. I experienced fatigue and a headache with the first dose, but no other symptoms.  I never experienced fever or chills

A 50-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK4176, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the left arm, on 07Jan2021, at 11:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and no known allergies . There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first vaccine of bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020, at 12:00 PM, Intramuscular, on the Right arm for Covid-19 immunization, he had numbness in his right hand x2 days. On 09Jan2021, following second dose, he has had numbness in both hands x2 days and on 10Jan2021, day 2, he ran a fever and his lighter weight facial fillers swelled and were painful (around the eyes - not my lip fillers). His eyes have a mix of Juvaderm products. It spontaneously resolved after 1 day with a subjective loss in overall volume. Density of the product used seemed to be a factor in the response. He knows this has been reported with the Moderna product, but he does not believe is has been reported with our product. It appears the response may not be product specific, but more specific to the type of vaccine. The patient has no Covid prior vaccination and not covid tested post vaccination. No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2020.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

Went to sleep in the morning on 3/6 he still was feeling horrible. Looked gray in color- thought he was getting the flu. At 2AM I woke to him having a seizure. Followed by another seizure at 10AM ( 3/7) followed by another seizure at 3PM (3/7) followed by another seizure at 3AM  (3/8) and another seizure at 6:30 AM on (3/8).

                                                Within 5 hours of receiving the shot my entire right arm was numb and tingly and my pinky finger felt like it wasn?t there.  I also has the worst headache of my life, ibuprofen didn?t help it.  The next morning (Friday) I felt somewhat better but by noon, I felt just as bad as the night before and the horrible headache was back.  Saturday and Sunday were exactly like Friday.  Monday morning, my arm was back to normal and the horrible headache was gone.  Since them I?ve had headaches on and off, but not as horrible as Thursday thru Sunday. This afternoon marks 1 week since my first of 2 doses.  I?m not sure at this point if I want to get the 2nd dose or not when it?s due.

                                                Patient received dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine at a clinic. After the dose was administered the patient experienced tachycardia (pulse 110), elevated BP (measured with arm cuff at ~180/120), headache, and warmth. The patient was offered a cold pack, given water, and was taken away to a secluded room to relax under supervision. After about 1.5 hours the patient improved (BP 120/76 and pulse 85). The patient informed me that his rheumatologist recently had him stop his treatments for Crohn&#39;s disease in preparation to receive the vaccine. He stated that he had similar symptoms before when trying different treatment regimens for his underlying condition. The patient left on his own and no further adverse effects were reported.

                                                I received the shot around noon on Tues March 16.  I was fine until 3am Wed March 17 when I woke up general body soreness and sweats.  I had Covid in March 2020 and the feeling was similar without the coughing and much shorter timeframe.  That continued until about 3am on Thursday March 18 when I thought I was almost back to normal.   When I woke up at 6am I thought I was ok but then I realized I had a lump under my left armpit on my side seemingly like my lymph node is swollen.  That continues as I write this at 341pm on Friday March 19.  I also developed hives on my right bicep and on my left and right buttocks and left and right hamstrings.  this is itchy.  I no longer have the soreness, sweating or fatigue but i have the swollen and what seems to be allergic reaction symptoms of hives.

                                                I got my first Pfizer covid shot around 3:30 PM on March 16, 2021.  Around 10:00 PM, my arm started to get some soreness.  I also noticed that I started feeling really sluggish with some muscle pains.   Approximately 11:30 PM, I attempted to go to sleep and noticed that I started having a minor respiratory distress where I could hear myself wheezing.  The wheezing only lasted about one hour.   All the symptoms disappeared after 36 hours without any treatments or medications.  At this point, I&#39;m not sure If I should get my second vaccine shot.

                                                Every since getting my vaccine I have been having these symptoms.  I received my first dose of phizer on 1/22/21 and a second dose 21 days later but was given Moderna not phizer.  I continue to have headaches on and off all day, they are short but intense lasting about 5-10 minutes, sometimes hour or two between.  Also shortness of breath and increased heart rate with just slight activity.  Going up a flight of stairs my heart rate will quickly increase to 130-140  BPM which has never happened before.  I have a fitness tracker on my watch so I watch it closely every day and it was never that high.  My heart rate will recover fairly quick if I sit and it will come down to 80-90 BPM, at night when relaxed for a while the lowest I see it is about 70-75 BPM, sleeping it will be around 65 bpm.

A 50-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE at the arm right (reported as right shoulder) for covid-19 immunisation (reported as he is trying to avoid serious illness). The patient medical history includes sleep from unknown date and if ongoing. Concomitant medication included zolpidem (reported as generic ambien) taken for sleep, start and stop date were not reported and added that he has been taking it for years but he hasn&#39;t taking it since he got the vaccine but thinks he took it the day before. The patient previously took bnt162b2 first dose on 10Mar2021 (roughly two weeks before the second dose) at the left shoulder for covid-19 immunisation. It was reported that the patient had no reaction to the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and he received the second dose on 31Mar2021. He explained following the second dose, his first issue was a &#34;headache&#34;, then he had &#34;real soreness&#34; in his arm where he got the injection. He added he developed a &#34;large lymph node under that arm&#34;, which he &#34;feels internally&#34;. He specified he still feels it a week later. He also explained he is &#34;unable to maintain an erection&#34;. He described himself as &#34;athletic&#34; and specified not having erectile problem in the past. He asked if his current symptoms have been reported as side effect to the vaccine. It was also added that after the second dose he appeared to have some issues with maintaining an erection on 04Apr2021. It was stated he is fairly active with a muscular build and could be a result after an exercise injury but this did happen after his second shot. Caller states he also had soreness in his arms and an enlarged lymph node under his arm that he could feel with his hand but that went away yesterday (from 01Apr2021 to 07Apr20210). The soreness was on both shoulders but he thinks the soreness on the other shoulder is from lifting weights and the shoulder from the injection site had pain, internal bone like pain (from 01Apr2021 to 07Apr20210). It was stated that the lymph node he could feel internally but didn&#39;t protrude through skin and went away yesterday and lasted 6-7 days. It was also reported that the soreness and lymph node went away yesterday and believes everything will get back to normal, he expected soreness to last a couple of days and it lasted a week. The patient stated he took some sleep medication after the second injection. He doesn&#39;t remember if it was the night before the injection. He took Ambien, a higher dosage. States maybe issues with maintaining an erection are beginning to improve. It was also stated the soreness and lymph node he noticed it the day after the injection, by the evening of 01Apr2021 and as of yesterday 07Apr2021 evening it feels like its completely back to normal. It was noted for the treatment that he didn&#39;t take anything but bought a gripper where he squeezes it and builds strength in his hands to give him some relief. The patient added that he&#39;s pretty active, he works out 4-5 days a week, including running. The outcome of the event some issues with maintaining an erection/ unable to maintain an erection was recovering; for the event headache was unknown, for all other events was recovered on 07Apr2021.  Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Presented to ED today with complaint of right-sided CP onset yesterday. Patient has history of renal cell carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver.  He has had recurrent pleural effusions involving the right lung.  Has worsened pain with breathing. Had a R tube placed due to pleural effusion and last week when the tape was taken off it pulled and caused pain. Endorses SOB. No significant cardiac history. No h/o DVT, PE. Has renal CA and had L kidney removed. Patient admitted. Pulmonary/critical care was consulted regarding Pleurx catheter.  It is felt that his pleural effusion had decreased in size, and the catheter was likely contributing to his right-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Catheter is removed with good results of his pain.  Patient however did have recurrent fevers.  Empirically placed on Rocephin.  With this, he did improve. He was discharged in stable condition.

A 50-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 50-year-old, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 25Mar2021 19:00 (Lot Number: ER8730; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to spring pollen, oak birch, and ash. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) and levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) taken as allergy medication. On 25Mar2021, the patient got the shot, waited 15 minutes, no problems. On 26Mar2021, woke up to a very very red face. On 27Mar2021, massive facial angioedema, fatigue, itching, notable penis redness, his penis was also &#34;sheet red&#34; and swollen. The patient started 4mg prednisolone on 27Mar2021, kept facial swelling and allergies at bay, mostly, but a very close rate to not keeping up. On 02Apr2021, swelling subsided and mostly was getting back to &#34;normal&#34;, however lips were flaking, skin flaking. On 04Apr2021-week of, things got better, very swollen lips but everything reasonably in check. On 12Apr2021, the face re-firing red at approx 1pm, slept until 6pm, and complete relapse of allergy/angioedema. Trip to Emergency room (ER), given shot of Kenelog in the arm, released. On 13Apr2021, no improvement, steroids ended 6 days after the patient started taking them, 2nd trip to ER with epinephrine shot, no improvement; blood taken, white blood cell count normal. On 14Apr2021, allergist appointment and he was told that he was allergic to something in the shot triggers pollen allergies, rosacea, etc. 50mg prednisone 5 days, 40mg 5 days, etc. He states that it was a systemic histamine reaction. On 26Apr2021 starts up again, mild, contact me. The patient doesn&#39;t know what to do with the second vaccine in general and he had called and they say no on him getting number 2. He was terrified of vaccines now because of his reaction. He also says that he was not hospitalized but he went to the emergency room twice. The patient would like to know if there have been any reports of those who had a similar reaction to this getting the second dose of the vaccine and how they reacted. He states that he has been told that he should not get the second dose but wonders if he were to get another COVID-19 vaccine other than Pfizer, if he would have the same reaction. The event allergic to something in the shot/systemic histamine reaction resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The event massive facial angioedema/ complete relapse of allergy/angioedema resulted to emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with steroids for the events. The outcome of the event massive facial angioedema/complete relapse of allergy/angioedema was not recovered while for the rest of the events was recovering.

Contracted Covid after receiving the first vaccine was reported. The patient received the first dose of the Covid vaccine, then contracted Covid. He now had the option to receive antibodies through plasma. Since he had the vaccine, was that still an option? Or was that a no-no? He received the vaccine at work on 21Dec2020. He got sick on 22Dec2020 and he was at home. He didn&#39;t feel like eating, and can&#39;t lay down because it made it worse to cough. He didn&#39;t know what vitamins they were giving him. The patient probably should be in a hospital, but was not. The outcome of events was not recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

                                                Day 8, I woke with a headache, chills, vomited 4 times, muscle aches, and heart palpitations all day until around 8 pm. I couldn&#39;t keep food down until then. From Day 8 until yesterday (Day 11), I have been having intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, which is my only serious concern.  I have had a declining number of heart palpitations today, Day 12, but felt I should report these heart palpitations in case this is a sign of a serious complication. Should I avoid receiving the second dose?

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

He was initially bleeding and unconscious and was brought by EMS to the hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital he had a temperature of 40 C. He was found to have 2 small left temporal hemmorhagic contusions on CT scan. He had a seizure during the hospitalization. He was initially treated for HSV encephalitis but it is not clear if that was confirmed. The hospital team may not have known of the recent vaccination. He improved during the hospitalization, but remained with a very unsteady gait. He could not return to the group home. He was transferred to a rehab facility to receive PT on 02/16/2021. He remains at rehab. Prior to the fall, on the 3rd day after vaccination, on 2/8/21 at about 10 am, the patient coughed and had a small blood on the inside of his face mask while at his day program. He was seen by his PCP and had no abnormal findings. He had a CBC, BMP and CXR and all were unremarkable.

On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                About 10 minutes after the shot I started feeling hot, started sweating, clammy hands, dizzy and then I passed out walking to get help. I hit my head on a chair when I was falling and cut my head. I stayed laying down because I was still dizzy and hot. They called the squad and did vitals and I was fine. I sat there for about another half an hour and I went home. I have felt fine ever since. Only thing that hurt was my head from the fall.

Headache lasted until I went to bed that night took Tylenol throughout the day with occasional mild help but not much. Took my temperature it was 98.8 I usually run around 96/97  It got up to 98.8 later that morning. As the day progressed my muscles ached and I had very little  energy.  I napped a little but otherwise was just planted on the couch.   The headache was the most annoying and steady.   All symptoms were gone when I woke the next morning.  My temp today is 97.7 and that?s a little higher than normal and my head still feels a little warm when  someone else feels it and I feel still a tad warmer than normal.   Otherwise I feel pretty good.

A 51-years-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 14Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 51 years as single dose. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. Historical v for covid-19 immunisation accine included the first dose of BNT162B2 administered on left arm on 24Mar2021 at age of 51 years for covid-19 immunisation and experienced no issues. Patient reported that after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, he had a fever for 8 days and was diagnosed with pneumonia on 21Apr2021. Patient reported that he was tested for both Covid-19, Influenza A, and Influenza B twice on 19Apr2021 and 21Apr2021 and tested negative for Covid-19 and influenza both times. Patient reported that he had no pre-conditions and that he was feeling great the night before he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, 13Apr2021. Patient reported that he was planning to go to work following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 14Apr2021. He began running a low-grade fever (102 degrees) on 14Apr2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and then his temperature flared up to 103.5 degrees on 15Apr2021. Fever: He received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at 10:45 on 14Apr2021 and about 2:00 in afternoon on 14Apr2021 was the first fever that was significant. The last fever he had on 21Apr2021, his temperature was 103.9. He was put on antibiotics for pneumonia. He contacted the on-call nurse for his company. The on-call nurse advised him to see a doctor on Saturday, 17Apr2021.He went to the doctor on Monday, 19Apr2021. The doctor only ran a Covid-19 swab for testing and a flu swab. His doctor did not do blood work and stated that the patientwas experiencing an ill effect of the Covid-19 vaccine and sent the patient home. He went back to the doctor on Wednesday, 21Apr2021. When he went back to the doctor, the staff performed a chest X-ray and ran 4 different blood works to see what the patient had. The second Covid-19 test that he received on 22Apr2021 was performed with both the rapid test and the test that was sent off. Both Covid-19 tests came back negative. SARS test on 22Apr2021 was negative. 508-3 High Sensitivity CRP: One of his numbers that was parts per liter, 3 is considered to be high risk and he had 300 (300&#43;) of whatever it was on 21Apr2021. He went back to the physician and was given another steroid shot an additional prescription. He had been back to the doctor 3 times since then. Fever: His fever was 103 consistently after 15Apr2021. 508-3 High sensitivity CRP: This value showed abnormal. The results said that relative risk was greater than 1 mg/liter and high was greater than 3. 1000 CBC with auto differential on 21Apr2021: The abnormal results were red blood cells measured at 4.38; hematocrit measured at 13.82; MCHC measured at 36.4; Neutrophils measured at 84; Lymphocytes measured at 12; and absolute Lymphocytes measured at 0.57. He wore a Garmin and that it recorded that he received no more than 2-3 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights. He didn&#39;t know anything about pneumonia previously and that he had specifically told his physician&#39;s office everything about what he was experiencing. He told his physician about the wheezing in his chest (on 17Apr2021), cough (on 16Apr2021), fever, and chills (on 14Apr2021). His physician told him it was a normal reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine and sent him home on 19Apr2021. He then consulted Google and started to realize that his side effect were very atypical. Wheezing: When he breathed really light, the crackling would continue. If he breathed shallow, the wheezing was audible but if he breathed deeply, it was not. The pneumonia was in the left side of his chest. He was still being treated for the pneumonia. He has his last dose of medication tomorrow, 27Apr2021, and that he was also being released to go back to work tomorrow. Cough: He had a little cough that would then go away. The cough began late Friday, 16Apr2021. It was interesting because it wasn&#39;t a main part of the illness. The cough was just kind of a hacking cough every once in awhile. The cough was not continuous like go and go and go and stop. The cough came, went away for awhile, then came again.The cough being worse was relative. He was coughing more than he did on Wednesday 21Apr2021, Thursday 22Apr2021, and Friday 23Apr2021. The cough was consistent more so at night when he laid down. He would probably say that it was a different feel towards the cough but it was still a cough. The cough was still the same volume but not the same effect. Headache (on 18Apr2021): He had been waking up with headaches in the morning and going to bed with them at night. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, the headache was due to dehydration from the fever and night sweats. Once he got away from the dehydration headaches, the headache got better but he had woken up with a headache the last few days and had a headache at bedtime a few nights in a row. The headache was usually a frontal headache and this morning, 26Apr2021, the headache was toward the back of his head. The headaches last a few hours until he started moving around. On Saturday, 17Apr2021 he experienced a migraine that would not go away. He didn&#39;t usually get migraines. The migraine lasted hours if not for a day and that the headache was something furious. Sunday 18Apr2021 was pretty much the same thing with the headache. Because of the massive fever, he couldn&#39;t eat anything at all (17Apr2021). The headache was mostly due to low blood sugar and dehydration. Appetite: His appetite improved after his second doctor&#39;s appointment on 21Apr2021. The second provider was a lot more straightforward and advised the patient that he needed to start taking care of himself and trying to force himself to eat. He forced himself to eat on 21Apr2021 and by Thursday 22Apr2021, he had a full appetite and was craving food again. Shortness of breath (Apr2021): Patient reported that the shortness of breath was just from being fatigued. Patient reported that he got out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He was unsure when the shortness of breath began because he was moving very little, but that he noticed the shortness of breath on Monday, 19Apr2021 when he got up to go to the doctor.On Friday 16Apr2021 and Saturday 17Apr2021, he had a really good break.On Friday 16Apr2021 from 9 AM to 1 PM, he had no fever and it was like the sun was coming out, then the fever hit really hard. The same thing happened on Saturday, 17Apr2021, but the fever free period lasted maybe a little longer. His fever returned and that the afternoon of Saturday 17Apr2021 was the worst he had been the entire time. On 13Apr2021 to get away from arm soreness, he did a few laps in the pool. On 13Apr2021 he had a new best time on the 100 in freestyle in the pool and that he felt really strong going into 14Apr2021 to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. There was nothing that would have indicated that he had anything going on before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Up until Saturday, 17Apr2021, he had only been taking Motrin and just taking 2 tablets. He had no break in between fevers and chills and was not able to get ahead of the fever with the Motrin. There was a long stretch where the Motrin wasn&#39;t working and his temperature didn&#39;t get below 100 for several days. He tried to cycle acetaminophen in beginning Saturday 17Apr2021 to try to get the acetaminophen in between the Motrin doses.  When he went back to the doctor on 21Apr2021, the provider told him that he could take 3 to 4 Motrin tablets at a time but not to exceed 4 doses per day. He never took more than 3 tablets. Motrin was generic ibuprofen. Night sweats (on 21Apr2021): The last couple of nights have been the same. He had a fan on to keep a little cooler and that it was 61 degrees outside and he felt the night sweats. He had a buckwheat mat that was cool that he put on the floor to stay cooler with the night sweats. Come Thursday, 22Apr2021, he said we&#39;re done with this and he couldn&#39;t sleep from it (Apr2021). Last night, 25Apr2021, he knew that he had night sweats because he was sweating at night and the temperature in the room was 64 degrees. AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room. AEs required a visit to Physician Office for fever, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chills. Outcome of events was unknown.

He said he no longer had heart palpitations or muscle twitching any more.  He denied any other symptoms.   Generally, he appeared well, no facial drooping, awake, alert, oriented, speech clear, and normal gait. (Today)

I can only guess how high it got but at least 103 degrees. I took Advil Liquid Gells and then my fever broke. I was actually scare for my life. In March I actually caught coronavirus and developed  anti bodies for Covid. I can only guess my body was fighting for it&#39;s life.

A 52-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 12:00 PM  (at the age of 52-years-old) via an unspecified route of administration at an unspecified dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included hypertension, high blood cholesterol from unknown dates. Allergy information was not provided.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was administered the vaccine at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility.  Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN/HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), fenofibric acid (FENOFIBRIC ACID), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine on Monday 28Dec2020. A PCR test for COVID was done on Tuesday and a rapid test on Wednesday both of which were negative. The patient experienced some scratchy throat late Friday night on Saturday, 02Jan2021 the patient called out sick to work as a cough had started. A PCR test was done on 02Jan2021 and he received results Monday (4th) as positive. The patient continued to say that the cough had subsided, as he took Delsym.  He lost taste and smell on Monday. He reports running a fever that varies from 99-101.5. He took Tylenol and Motrin to control the fever. In addition he has experienced fatigue. It was also reported, in contradiction of the above reported chronology of events, that the onset date of events was 25Dec2020 (CONFIRMATION PENDING for onset date of events relative to vaccine administration). The patient experiences of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue resulted in a physician office visit (date not specified).  The patient underwent lab tests that includes a PCR test on 29Dec2020 which was negative, a rapid test on 30Dec2020 which was negative and a PCR test on 02Jan2021 which was positive. Treatment for the events was reported as Motrin and Tylenol for fever and Delsym. for cough. The clinical outcome of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue was reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 28Dec2020, and COVID-19 PCR test positive on 02Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

A 52-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ELO140) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 11Jan2021 at 9:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

He had numbing and tingling in his left three fingers (clarified left three fingers as his middle finger, index finger, and ring finger) and numbing and tingling in his toes as well. Concomitant medications included ubidecarenone (COQ-10), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), rosuvastatin and monascus purpureus (RED YEAST RICE). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 52 years old on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Today he started to feel better, but still a little nauseous. He had severe fatigue. He didn&#39;t realize he could go fill out something on the website for CDC. He knew he had wanted the vaccine because he had some severe symptoms when he had COVID. He didn&#39;t want to get COVID again. His hospital frustrates him sometimes. They didn&#39;t put the date on there when he was to come back for the second dose. They didn&#39;t tell him to come back on the 13th. He had to figure the dates from the website and emails. He talked it over with his wife. He came in contact with it every night. He was taking care of people that were critical. He worked in the intensive care unit. Even the people he took care of that didn&#39;t have it, ended up with it. He wore a mask. He used hand sanitizer. He didn&#39;t want to get it again. People were shocked when he got it the first time. He did verify that he got the second dose one day sooner, instead of the three day window. He was sick with the first and was expecting to be more sick with this one. He wanted to give himself an extra day before he had to go back to work. He had a couple of emails where they discussed increasing the window to do it a day sooner. He was going to have to go an hour an half a way to get the second dose and he didn&#39;t want to do that. The patient underwent lab test included height was approximately six two, weight was about 194 lbs on an unspecified date, and body temperature showed 96 degrees Fahrenheit in Jan2021.

On 04Feb2021 04:45 PM, the patient reported that he believed he experienced an ocular migraine in his left eye approximately 9 hours after getting the second shot. He took 2 acetaminophen 500 mg tablets and the symptoms cleared up in 20-30 minutes. He has never experienced this sort of sensation before so he figures it could possibly be related.

The outcome of the event ophthalmic migraine was recovered on 04Feb2021 while headache was recovered on Feb2021.

                                                I contracted Covid 19 in mid October 2020 and I lost my sense of smell and taste.  It took a long time to start coming back and was at about 60% of normal when I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Four days after the shot my sense of smell and taste changed.  From that day until present almost everything I smell and taste has a &#34;chemical&#34; taste and smell.  Nothing smells normal and very few things taste good.  Animal proteins are especially bad as well as some fruits and vegetables.  Most foods make my stomach so upset that it is nearly impossible to eat.  All smells are the same, nothing smells pleasant and most smells give me a light headache.  I have lost over ten pounds since this started and I have general malaise.

The first week after getting the vaccine he only had kind of had localized soreness and pain in the area. He later clarified it was in the area where got the injection, vaccine. He just had pain soreness in that area. Other than that he had no side effects at that time. The third week, initially stated as, about 5-7 days ago he started to have a feeling of anxiousness in the brain. He could feel anxiousness and sensation in his brain that he did not feel before.

Peaked at 24 hours after shot. 3.  &#34;Glans/local ache&#39; (lower back/kidneys and testicles) within 8 hours.  Testicle ache stopped with 36 hours after shot.  Kidney/lower back ache still lightly present at 48 hours. 4.  Shaking/Chills.  Started 12 hours after shot.  Went from light to extreme within 30 minutes.  Shaking and shivering uncontrollably.   To the point I would not have been able to dial 911 for help if I had needed.   No matter what I did I could not get warm or stop shaking.  Extreme shaking lasting about 2 hours.  In about 2 more hours shaking subsided and stopped.  So shaking stopped around 16 hours after shot.  Chills continued until around 36 hours after shot. 5.  Cold sweat/Fever.  Sweating starting 11 hours after shot.  Lasting until about 36 hours after shot.  For fever, Unknown how high it was as I was too busy uncontrollably shaking to take my temperature.  Fever remained for about 48 hours in low grade form EXCEPT for hours 11 through 18 after shot - I am sure it was very high due to headache, chills, shaking, etc at that time.  Basically, for most of the 2 days, it felt like the flu.  But for 6 hours, (hours 11 through 17 after receiving the shot), it was the sickest I can recall beings in decades.    Will &#39;click&#39; I have recovered below in item 20.  But not 100% back to normal yet.  90% back to normal would be a good current &#39;level&#39;.  Expect to feel 100% again tomorrow or the next day based on recovery rate.

A 53-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), solution for injection, lot number: EK5730, intramuscular in the left shoulder on 23Dec2020 12:00 at a single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient&#39;s historical vaccine included Shingrix and experienced weak, tired and achy that lasted for 24 hours, he received this 6 months ago (2020). The patient experienced achy joints and fatigue, both on 24Dec2020 at 10:00 with outcome of recovering. The patient called about the Covid-19 vaccine and reported that he received it last Wednesday on 23Dec2020. He said that since then he has had achy joints and fatigue that started on Thursday 24Dec2020 that has been going on through today. He received the vaccine at the hospital where he works at. His symptoms are persisting, but stated that he does feel a little bit better today. He said that it does not seem to be getting worse. He read achy joints and tiredness were some of the reactions to be expected with the medication, and now he was thinking it was a little more long term than what it should be.

On 31Dec2020, headaches on both sides of his head; the event was considered medically significant. The patient received TYLENOL for the event. The patient did not recover from the event. The physician considered the event was related to suspect vaccine. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

I had a dripping sweat occur at the five to fifteen minute range. There was a flushing sensation during this. After a few minutes, it all abaited. The bandaid was saturated with blood.  My arm was never sore and I had zero symptoms after the initial reaction. I believe this injection was given intravascularly.  I have not been able to find ANY information to address the effectiveness of this route if administration and I seriously fear that I am not covered.

About 10 minutes later, as I was driving home, I had an odd taste in my mouth and my right cheek started to go numb.  I arrived home and started looking for answers (Pfizer information page that lists side effects).  The sensation lasted about an hour or so, then started to subside.  By the time I went to bed, there was just a little tingle at the edge of my cheek bone. Other than being tired and a bit woozy, I feel better today.

EKG was performed and patient was found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation. Patient was given fluid boluses, 10mg IV diltiazem, and a diltiazem infusion, during which the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm. After stabilization, he was discharged with new prescriptions for metoprolol tartrate 25mg BID and apixaban 5mg BID, to follow up with cardiology.

                                                I ate nothing that morning of the shot. The first day:  I took the covid-19 vaccine Pfizer shot on Thursday the 4th of March; there was pain at the injection site just as any other vaccine I have been administered during military service.  After the shot I felt tied, and my left arm did hurt from the shot, I started to feel irritable (angry or even aggressive), my chest became tight and my heart rhyme felt somewhat off causing me to start coughing and sometimes uncontrollable to the point I could not catch my breath I thought about seeking medical attention but did not..  The second day:  Pain in my left arm went away at the injection site, tiredness went away, and the feeling of irritable (angry or even aggressiveness) went away, tightness in my chest and coughing went away. I have been having a chronic pain in my left arm for about a year and after the shot the pain was gone I noticed that on the second day. I did notice my body temperature was up and down showing symptoms of histamine reaction but not out of control.

                                                1st symptom: Within 30 seconds, ache in arm from elbow to wrist.  Got worse over next few minutes, fairly uncomfortable for about 45 minutes before subsiding slightly (tried to keep moving arm as recommended).  Pain returned when I drove to work and while at my desk.  Lasted for approx 4 more hours.  Injection at 11:15am, pain mostly ended around 9:30pm (except when reaching or extending arm, pain in shoulder now mostly). 2nd symptom: Mild nausea starting about 5 min after injection, while in waiting room.  Passed when laying down at home before work, approx 45 min later..  Started again while driving to work and lasted from about 4pm to 8pm.  Subsided about 10pm.   3rd symptom - feel very fatigued.at typing of this report at 10pm - started about 5pm. So far nothing else - no headache or chills for example.  No pain at all at the actual injection site - now the pain is mostly above it - from the shoulder joint to near the injection site (maybe a couple inches above.) as well as the forearm, all around.   To make coping easier in case the symptoms (arm ache, fatigue, etc) are worse as commonly described from the 2nd dose I put in and was approved for PTO from work for scheduled 2nd date on  March 30th.   Will allow me to rest (avoid being effected at work with the fatigue and an even more achy arm as expected side effects of 2nd dose)

                                                Felt weird 5 minutes after shot.  10 minutes after shot I called over a tech and said I didn&#39;t feel right.  The took my vitals and found the my blood pressure had dropped to 85/45.  They called 911 and hit me with an EpiPen.  I never blacked out.  After another 10 minutes the fire department arrived and they took vital signs; all normal.  Another 10 minutes and ambulance arrived.  Vitals in the back of the ambulance were fine.  Got to the emergency room and vitals were fine including ekg.  Was released from the hospital about 4.5 hours after the initial shot.  I feel a little sluggish today but otherwise fine.

He went to the ER with Covid and could not get out of bed for ten days.  No additional medical treatment at this time

                                                Chronic tinnitus significantly increased in intensity/volume the day following the first injection--I estimate about double the volume. In both ears. After 12 days it has not subsided at all. The increase in severity is causing secondary headache, jaw clenching, sleeplessness, irritability, hearing issues.

I went to the Urgent Care where they gave me Antihistamine, Prednisone, something for headache and IV Fluids.  I was discharged after three hours and felt better within a few hours. I took Prednisone for five days.

The next day (3/7) the right side of my face was numb and showing symptoms of what doctors later decided was Bells Palsy. on 3/7 I had fatigue and general feeling bad like I had the flu. On Monday 3/8, I was feeling worse and I called the advice nurse who advised I go to the  Emergency room due to right face partial paralysis, numbness, and face drooping. They diagnosed Bells Palsy and prescribed Valtrex and prednosone. From 3/9-12 the right side of my face was numb, droopy and I had ear pain and a lot of fatigue. By Saturday 3/13 I was feeling better and have gradually gotten better through today 3/26. I still have numbness in my right cheek. and occasional tingling in my lips. My doctor has advised me to go ahead and get the second dose of vaccine tomorrow 3/27. Also, during the week of 3/7 - 3/12 I had some dizziness and a general foggy feeling in my head.

A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 (at the age of 54-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included metformin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, glimepiride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, lisinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient experienced not feeling well, ate a bit but not much, kind of pale, vomiting, trouble in breathing, and agitated on 04Jan2021; body was hyper dried and restless on 05Jan2021; mind just seemed like it was racing on 06Jan2021; and not responsive and he passed away on 06Jan2021 at 10:15 (reported as: around 10:15 AM). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the vaccine on 04Jan2021, after which he started not feeling well. He went right home and went to bed. He woke up and ate a bit but not much and then was kind of pale. The patient then started to vomit, which continued throughout the night. He was having trouble in breathing. Emergency services were called, and they took his vitals and said that everything was okay, but he was very agitated; reported as not like this prior to the vaccine. The patient was taken to urgent care where they gave him an unspecified steroid shot and unspecified medication for vomiting. The patient was told he was probably having a reaction to the vaccine, but he was just dried up. The patient continued to vomit throughout the day and then he was very agitated again and would fall asleep for may be 15-20 minutes. When the patient woke up, he was very restless (reported as: his body was just amped up and could not calm down). The patient calmed down just a little bit in the evening. When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn&#39;t breathe, and his mind was racing. The patient&#39;s other brother went to him and he was not responsive, and he passed away on 06Jan2021 around 10:15 AM. It was reported that none of the symptoms occurred until the patient received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of all of the events was unknown; not responsive was not recovered, the patient died on 06Jan2021. The cause of death was unknown (reported as: not known by reporter). An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and has been requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: not responsive and he passed away

Patient also had mild fever for the last two days and was on Tylenol, blood pressure also remained elevated moderately than the usual readings. Patient was admitted through ER for 2 days and was discharged on 1/24/21, with a diagnosis of possible TIA, Todd&#39;s paresis post seizure. Patient&#39;s CT head and MRI of brain was negative for acute stroke. Patient&#39;s left facial droop and right side facial puffiness resolved over a week but noticed to have right sided pronounced weakness with moderate swelling on right arm. Patient used to eat by himself,but now not able to do so and not able to hold cup in the right hand. Patient was again sent to ER for repeat CAT scan of head, further evaluation and management. Not sure if patient had an adverse reaction to Covid-19 vaccination, but definitely these symptoms were developed after 2 weeks of receiving Pfizer vaccination, which may be coincidental. Patient was followed up by the neurologist a week after the discharge from hospital who couldn&#39;t rule out adverse reaction of vaccination. Patient is awaiting for an EEG, carotid ultrasound and Echo as an out patient.

                                                About day nine after the first dose, I had a very quick onset of diverticulitis that hospitalized me for five days.  I had some bouts with it before but nothing that had come on so suddenly.  I have had an elevated immune system in the past and it felt like my body just went into an attack mode and previous location for diverticulitis was impacted.  It is important to note that my diet had changed to no red meat two years ago and I had no occurrences of DV and was feeling much healthier from a GI perspective.  Also, and of equal importance, is that following the second dose at about the exact time frame I got the normal post vaccine symptoms (headache, slight fever, etc.).  That nine-ten day mark is what is making me curious given my immune system.  Thanks.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 24Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 54 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cholesterol. The patient was diagnosed with BPH a few years back 2016 or 2017 and had a uralist in 2019 and that resolved his issues. The patient had been on no BPH meds and back to normal since that procedure. Co-suspect medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) from an unknown date to 01Apr2021 at 40 mg, 1x/day for blood cholesterol. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced prostate infections, and abdominal discomfort. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced arm pain, and was lightheaded. He described the arm pain as he had deltoid pain but he also had pain like he had been hit from his right pectoral down his arm to about 4-5 inches above his wrist. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, sweat, urinating blood, and dark colored urine. The patient was concerned with the dark urine so he stopped taking atorvastatin, and called his physician who said he didn&#39;t need it anyhow. The patient visited the urologist office and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) as treatment for dark colored urine, urinating blood and prostate infection. On 06Apr2021, the patient experienced leukocytes in urine. Relevant lab data on 06Apr2021 included a urinalysis which resulted in leukocytes and blood &#43;3. The action taken in response to the event dark urine with atorvastatin was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events prostate infection, and abdominal discomfort was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events arm pain, and lightheaded was recovered in 26Mar2021. The outcome of the events couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, and sweat was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of the events urinating blood and dark colored urine was recovered on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the event leukocytes in urine was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the serious events Prostate infection, Blood in urine, and Urine color abnormal are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drugs. Relevant medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may provide a plausible explanation for the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021450744 same patient/SD, different AE/dose

She states some of the symptoms started some time after his first dose but couldn&#39;t provide a time frame. On 5/6 he answered the Vaccine Questionnaire question of &#34;are you sick today?&#34; as &#34;unsure&#34; and further discussion was had with a pharmacist to verify he was eligible to receive vaccine. Neither the pharmacist or patient remember the details of this discussion.  Patient and wife have belief that his ethnicity contributed to dismissing of possible illness during the vaccine screening process, but due to the patient&#39;s lethargy and brain fog at the time, he could not provide specifics of the conversation. His wife was not with him during the screening process with the pharmacist or during vaccine administration. The appointment time was 4:55pm. The wife states the patient was so fatigued after the shot was administered on 5/6 that he was asleep in his chair in the observation area.  Later that day fever of 100.5 was noted and controlled by OTC ibuprofen 2 hours after the ibuprofen was administered. The wife states that he rapidly declined over the 3 days after second Pfizer vaccine and she called an ambulance on Sunday 5/9. From the ER he was admitted to the ICU with the primary reason for admission listed as hyperglycemia but a COVID was listed as a contributing factor. The COVID test administered Sunday was positive. He had high blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, and sodium. Patients vitals have since stabilized other than the sodium is still high. He is in ICU at hospital still very lethargic as of today 5/10.

Was sleeping 12 plus hours a day without feeling rested in the least. No problems with sleep. Also had heaviness of chest - felt like rib cage made of iron- this dissipated by the 28-29th. No excessive cough or fever, did have dyspnea with any exertion and this continues but seems to be lessening. Was not able to work due to fatigue. Yesterday remained tired but felt noticeably different-felt lighter-and today seems promising.

About 1/1 had ill feeling, very tired, soreness in joints, extreme pain in arm/ legs. did not have breathing problem.  pain and limited range motion lasted until 1/7/21. I called health clinic and they told me to call cdc number on vaccination card.  That number sent me to reporting center, no help.  Called family physician, they said they knew nothing about vaccine.  Since i wasn?t having breathing problem i just dealt with pain and took Tylenlol couple times each day.  Took second dose vaccine 1/20/21.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

                                                Within two hours Swelling on the left arm - upper part and it was painful. The first dose of the vaccine, the pain started the second day and the injection site got swollen. But this second dose was within 2 hours of my vaccine even more and overwhelming fatigue.  - aches, chills, muscle cramps, coughing, sweating - those lasted three days; headache - ever present and felt like head was in a vice; breathing was an issue - asthma was triggered on Sunday  - I started prednisone  - informal dr consultation with a friend - on Tuesday because of the asthma and by Friday I was feeling halfway better again and by the following Sunday about 75% better. 9 days later I was back at work. It took that week back at work though to get back out of the funk and by the following weekend I was close to 90%. Pain in the shoulder lasted about two weeks - it was quite tender for that long.

It stopped in the evening but got constant low headaches afterwards. Around 5pm, felt like a change in taste (saltier taste) that was temporary. Has uncomfortable wrist pain like twisting a screwdriver too much. Started feeling itchy today after 9 am. Face was swollen after waking up today and has subsided greatly since. Had very low fever last night and now feels like no fever. Right now, feeling has a lot of saliva and then have to swallow and little uncomfortable in arms and knees, and weakness. Only took one Aleve pill last night. Around 4:30pm, felt a little blurry for 5 to 10 seconds.

                                                After having slight headaches(normal side effects) with dull eye pain from 11pm thru overnight of March 23,  at 10:30 I went out drving in car and my eyes were squinting. with heavy dark clouds(not bright) outside.   I looked at my pupils and they were pinpoint to slightly bigger.   My glasses are auto tint, but not so much behind car windows.   When I got home I sat in a dim room(lights off, but sliding door blinds closed but some light coming in) for an hour eating lunch.  I then checked my pupils and they were about a third the size of my iris.    Mild headache, dull eye pain and squinting continued.   I searched the internet and found no details about eye problems.  I called, ask a nurse and was told they found no information about eye problems at CDC or internet related to vaccine, but perhaps it is headache causing eye problems.    Seems like this should be listed somewher!  Or do I need to see my opthalmologist?   You should be complete in side effects that eye problems are possible.   I had no problems prior to vaccine.    Do with this what you will(likely ignore it as you are bidens cdc).

EMS crew became concerned for stroke. In ED, the patient remained hypertensive (178/93). ED Physician had high suspicion of TIA versus acute reaction to COVID-19 vaccine. Administerd 650mg acetaminophen and 1mg Lorazepam. Admitted patient to critical care unit where patient stated they had developed a sudden-onset diffuse banding-like headache with associated nausea, diaphoresis, blurry vision, and confusion. MRI was negative and patient was transferred from ICU to hospital. Hospital physician believed the symptoms were likely a vagal mediated response or reaction to his COVID vaccination.

But by the time he and his wife drove out of town, he started to get HOT with the sweats, terrible headache, dizziness and started to lose his vision. He pulled over to let his wife drive and by the time he got out of the car he could barely navigate to the passenger side. They turned around and headed for the hospital, 8 min away, at this time he couldn&#39;t see anything, he was nauseated but knew the hospital was pretty close. During this whole time his heart rate never raced just kept and even beat. His breathing was also just fine. By the time they got into the parking lot his vision was slowly getting better, so they sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes with the air conditioner on as high as it could go. His wife read through the side effects, he was experiencing many on the list. They left without going in. Onset of the events was reported as 12Mar2021 12:45 AM.

A 55 year old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, age at vaccination 55 years old. Medical history included Diabetic from 2013 (Diabetes is fairly under control. He has no super high readings. His diet is better); blood pressure (blood pressure abnormal) from 2013; ongoing overweight (obviously he is overweight) from an unknown date; and heart (disorder) from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for an unspecified indication; lisinopril for blood pressure (abnormal); and lovastatin for heart (disorder), start and stop dates were not reported. Patient is taking an unspecified over the counter multivitamin. There were no other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient is due for the second dose on 9April2021, but he tested positive for COVID-19 on 01Apr2021 with a PCR test described as oral saliva test. Patient was negative on a rapid test on an unspecified date. Patient wanted to know if he could reschedule the shot and when is it recommended. The patient had a coworker who tested positive, he decided since his throat was scratchy that maybe he had got it, then two more employees had gotten COVID-19 so he got a rapid test that was negative. On Mar2021, he stated he stayed home because he was experiencing mild congested in his head/congested in his head, which it still actually was, and he lost sense of smell completely. He was really tired, sleeping a lot, had congestion in his ears, and he can&#39;t smell anything. Patient had no fever, and his lungs were clear (unspecified date), so he commented it was deceiving since he feels fine like he can do whatever he wants, then he gets exhausted and sleeps. He stated he can&#39;t work for a whole week. He stated he is assuming his first dose of the shot is helping with it. Patient stated he is doing well, he has it (COVID-19), but he feels pretty good. Outcome of congested in his head was not recovered, while unknown for the other events.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base. He had pain in the base of his right foot. Blood tests were in the second week. Glucose was high and he is hypoglycemic.

Patient experienced mild COVID symptoms such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, and tiny bit of shortness of breath on 24Dec2020, but stated he was better now. The patient was positive in the COVID test on 28Dec2020. He wanted to know if it was normal to get COVID after getting the vaccine and if he should get the booster shot if he gets better.  He commented that testing positive for COVID was medically concerning. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow ECMO) or receive a mechanical ventilation. Treatment included over the counter medication. No additional testing was done. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the event sore arm was unknown; cough was not recovered; fever, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, tiny bit of shortness of breath was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number was already obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 virus test positive cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A contactable nurse and contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ XR), orally from 02Oct2020 at 11 mg, daily for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 19Dec2020, the patient experienced neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare.  In Dec2020, the patient experienced increase in joint pain from his baseline. The physician was aware. The patient was placed on unspecified steroids for the events, neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare which minimized symptoms. While weaning off steroids, the severity of symptoms returned. The patient was instructed by the doctor to stop taking tofacitinib citrate which was stopped on 29Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for tofacitinib citrate was permanently withdrawn on 29Dec2020.  The patient reported slight improvement after stopping tofacitinib citrate.  The outcome of neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare was recovering and of increase in joint pain from his baseline was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, the reported events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors and unlikely that it is related to the suspect product. However due to temporal association with the vaccine, a possible contributory role of vaccine cannot be ruled out. Case will be reevaluated based on additional information during the follow-up.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

                                                I did not experience any adverse symptoms with the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine with the exception of injection site pain after the first dose that began on day 2 through day 5 or for 3 days.  The first Pfizer-BioNTech dose was received on December 30, 2020, LOT EK5730. I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS on 12/31/20.  Please note that I completed the same pretreatment protocol 1.5 hours prior to dosing with Pfizer-BioNTech of Diphenhydramine 25 mg plus Pepcid 20 mg for both COVID-19 doses.  I elected to complete a self-administered pretreatment protocol due to a shellfish allergy and literature reports of anaphylaxis with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in food allergy recipients.  I did not experience any adverse symptoms on Saturday afternoon after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at 4:45pm on 1/23/21.  On Sunday morning 1/24/21, I awoke feeling &#34;cold.&#34;  I dressed warmly, but the feeling progressed to chills by 3pm.  Malaise ensued around 1pm.  I also experienced injection site pain on the morning of 1/24/21 beginning at 7am.  The pain lasted until 1/25/21.  I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS ON 1/24/21.   I began to feel uncomfortable with malaise and chills at 6:15pm on 1/24/21 and self-administered one dose of OTC Aleve, Naproxen sodium 220mg plus one dose of Benadryl 25 mg.  I began to feel better by 9pm on 1/24/21.  I awoke on 1/25/21 without any symptoms or discomfort with the exception of some injection site pain (2 out of 10 on VAS).  I have been asymptomatic since 1/26/21.

I then became goofy. Started laughing etc. Then in the drive home about 20 minutes later I started to be tired. I was in the phone with a friend and slipped into a deep slumber. The next day Saturday I woke groggy like from a hang over minus the headache. I had a sudden urge to eat , i bacon and egg sandwich with mayo then had a urgency to eat a bowl of cereal. (rice crispies. Then tried to work (remotely from home) but I could not concentrate or focus. Finally I just threw in the towel and went back to sleep. Woke up to send this report.  Good night. I still recommend this inoculation to everyone!

For the Uveitis I went to my eye doctor and started a prednisolone regimen and am still on it. I received the 2nd does (lot EL9264) yesterday on 3 Feb at 09:00am. The mouth ulcers were treated with oral medication-Valtrex. 2nd dose does not seem to have aggravated the above noted reactions. Other symptoms common to the injection are occurring but seem more intense after the 2nd dose (aches, low energy, some minor coughing)

                                                First injection - only a sore right deltoid (injection site).  Fairly intense but only lasted 24 hours and easily alleviated by Tylenol. Second injection - Ringing in my ears - noticeable starting about 9pm the day of the second injection (3/11/21) and it&#39;s still going strong.  Intensity of ringing has remained constant to date unfortunately.  Headache was minor and on &amp; off starting the night of the injection date and appear to still encounter them but intensity has been low.  Taken Tylenol to alleviate symptom with success.  Soreness at injection site - less intense on second shot than first but it lasted about 48 hours.  The Tylenol I took for the headache seemed to help with the arm pain.  On the day after the injection, my right latissimus dorsi (same side as shot) became sore but only for about 24 hours. Tiredness - didn&#39;t feel the exhaustion until about 9pm on the day of the injection.  Exhaustion/tiredness set in more than expected so very low activity the day after and went to bed several hours earlier than normal.  Still feeling tired but emerging from that as i&#39;m starting to feel more energy come back.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer reported that her 56 years-old male son (patient) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation on 24Mar2021. Relevant history and concomitant drugs were unknown. The reporter stated that her 56 year old son received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine a day earlier than she received hers (which was on 25Mar2021) and while waiting after getting his vaccination, her son became &#34;very, very dizzy.&#34; He told the nurse working at the vaccination site that the dizziness was getting worse and &#34;getting very bad.&#34; He was asked how his breathing was and he told the nurse it was okay, but an ambulance was called for him anyways and he was sent to the hospital. Her son reported feeling better when he laid down but still reported feeling dizzy. At the hospital, her son was told that all the test came back okay. When her son got up to use the restroom with the assistance of the doctor, the doctor told him that he was dehydrated and gave him IV fluids. Caller stated that her son reported feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; after the IV fluids but &#34;couldn&#39;t hardly walk&#34; and had to have someone else drive him. Her son reported feeling &#34;alright&#34; the next day. Caller stated that she was reading in the information pamphlet on the Pfizer vaccine that a severe reaction could include dizziness. Caller was worried about her son getting his second dose and think she should speak with his physician before receiving his next dose, and would like to know if this was okay. She was concerned because she states that she had heard that people have gotten sick from the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was resolving. Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

I was admitted to Piedmont for observation (I had an intermittent fever) and tested for everything. All results; MRI, CT, Echocardiogram, showed normal for my age. The pain is better and improving but it?s still been significantly longer lasting than any previous time. My PCP suggested I post this info to the CDC website but I wanted to let you know in case you were compiling any info related to symptoms/side effects.

                                                I had my first shot of Pfizer vaccine last Friday morning (March 5). In the evening, I felt fatigued. So I went to sleep early. When I got up Saturday morning, I felt dizzy. The dizziness went away in a few minutes. In the next 36 hours, I had the angina feelings - tightness in the left chest and I felt heart be squeezed occasionally. When I stand up and walk, I felt better. Finally Sunday evening (March 7), I took a walk outside and felt symptom free. Maybe the walk helped, maybe the &#34;thrombosis&#34; had run its course before my walk.   I have not had the severe angina symptoms since my PCI procedure in Feb 2018. I am sure the recent occurrence is related to the vaccine.   Besides reporting the adverse event, I want to get advices whether I should receive the second shot.   Thank you!

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  On Friday morning, at 6-7am, less than 24 hours from the time I received my vaccination, I was experiencing chills and could not get warm. I tried to go to work...well, I did go to work. When it became apparent that I was not going to get warm, I left work. When I got home, my wife made me breakfast between 8:30 &amp; 9:00am. After i eat, I slept under a sheet and two blankets...fully dressed for 5 hours. When I came to, it was the first time all day that I felt some warmth.

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

His wife gave him 2 Benedryl while waiting for the paramedics to arrive. They arrived quickly, within 10 minutes.  The medical team monitored him at home for about 30 minutes. During this time had high Blood Pressure. They offered to take him to the hospital but he declined. He wanted to monitor himself at home to see if it would resolve itself.  He spent the rest of the night in a recliner to help him breath, with his wife by his side.  He did not follow up with any medical professional.  He did NOT get the 2nd vaccination and will NOT.

I beleive it was a lymph node. 3) Also this morning, I had a red rash across my chest and abdomin.  I sometime get this when I&#39;m getting well after being sick.  My doctor called.

                                                One week after the vaccine the arm was very red and looked infected. He went to the doctor and was given Amoxicillin. But two days later he was feeling so ill he was in bed all day and had a horrible headache. He went back to the doctor 3-26. The doctor cut his arm open, drained it, flushed it and gave him an antibiotic shot in the rear end. He also prescribed Doxycycline and Linezolid because he believes its a MRSA infection. He did swab it but we don&#39;t have the results back yet. The wound is not as red today and my husband is feeling better. Should he get the second vaccine? the doctor said this was the second patient he saw that day with the same infection at the vaccine site. I received my vaccine the same time and had zero issues. The doctor thought maybe his arm was not sufficiently alcohol swabbed but I know he was swabbed as was I as we were in the same room. He has severe asthma so we wanted the protection from the Covid vaccine but want to know if it is safe to get the second vaccine? I have taken photos each day so I can share what his arm has looked like

A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor.

No issues with vaccine given approximately 0715, until 1005 am after a very busy morning with nothing but coffee to drink. As I sat down to assist in order entry in our chemo clinic I suddenly became aware of a very rapid heart rate. I realized that I was having a vaso-vagal response and started perspiring lightly and realizing I was having drop in blood pressure. I composed myself removed my mask and breathed slowly and drank cold water while sitting. After a few minutes I was able to slow my heart rate and felt secure enough to leave the pharmacy. I slowly walked and controlled my breathing and continued to drink water. I was able to return to work and continued until the end of the day. I felt somewhat fatigued until bedtime that evening. Slept reasonably well that night and had no other symptoms to my memory the following day.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.

Most problematic has been the re-emergence of a long dormant auto-immune disorder (12&#43; yrs), bullous pemphigus. This disorder, when active, causes blistering and sloughing skin in soft tissue areas. It can be very painful and uncomfortable. It usually emerges when I have a significant event that causes my immune system to plummet. I fully believe this vaccine precipitated this occurrence.

Note that  I had similar reactions to the flu vaccine&#39;s for 17 straight years , with the exception of the brain fog. Flu shot reactions stopped when I started taking Amway  Double X multivitamins and tripling up on Vitamin A, C, Zinc and echinacea 3 days before through after the vaccine.  Shot 1 - initial  side effects: 40 minutes after shot within a mile of returning to work from hospital, I suddenly got lightheaded and very tired with brain fog creeping in. Since that was closer than home, I continued  on to work hoping it would soon pass.  Brain fog,  dizziness and fatigue all  continued to worsen, and I was taken home. Effects lasted 9 hours. 3-4 days later the symptoms all came back and lasted 2-3  days, with the addition of temperatures in mid to high 96 range. My normal temperature is a degree low at 97.8.

                                                Pt began feeling short of breath and feverish the night after receiving vaccine, which worsened to right-sided chest pain w/ inspiration that radiated to his back. Pt returned to work 03/01/2021 then checked into urgent care the following day d/t worsening symptoms. Patient Plan written by PAC: &#34;At this time the nature of your pain is not clear. Your cardiac enzymes are within normal limits except for myoglobin which often goes up with skeletal muscle pain. Your BNP test which can come up with congestive heart failure is elevated slightly from your normal.  We will want to recheck this in a week or so. Differential diagnoses could be skeletal muscle pain/injury, herpes zoster or shingles. (This can sometimes have sharp nerve type pain that will develop into a rash within the first 7 days.) Your rapid COVID test was negative.  We are sending a PCR test out just to confirm.  While awaiting test results please isolate at home. We will call you soon as results are back. Refer to Mendocino County&#39;s packet/isolation order. Your potassium level is low at 3.2.  It should be 3.6. We gave you some potassium to take in the clinic.  I am going to give you some to take for an additional few days. When you follow-up next week plan to have your labs redrawn.&#34; Plan Orders: SARS-CoV-2 RNA (COVID-19), QUALITATIVE NAAT to be performed. URIC ACID to be performed. The patient had the following medication order(s) completed today: Potassium Chloride 40meq PO; Toradol 15mg IVP.

                                                Pt reported he got the second COVID vaccine at 8:33 am at the  Center at an event run by Health Clinic. At 10 am he began to feel unwell describing &#34;disorientation&#34; which upon further explanation seems he is describing difficulty with his proprioception, ie not able to tell where his body is in space, and disequilibrium, ie having to stop and hold on to something while walking. This lasted most of the day and subsided by evening. He has continued to have ongoing shorter episodes 3-4 times per day lasting 5-10 minutes. In addition he has noted increasing weakness in his right thigh, particularly when going from sitting to standing and the through swing while walking. He describes these as &#34;paralytic attacks&#34; that occur once or twice per day and last hours. Both symptoms are similar to those he had post CVA in 2019 and greatly improved with PT and home exercises. In addition he has noted fecal urgency and fecal incontinence in the last couple of weeks, he is unsure if this is directly related to the vaccine.

Concomitant medication included ongoing metoprolol for blood pressure. There were no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient stated that he got sick after getting the vaccine (on 30Jan2021) and had an important question. He got a fever (31Jan2021) and all that stuff that lasted like a day and a half after getting the vaccine, just like a million other people. But he missed the part about asking a doctor about taking his blood thinner, which he took as normal up through the day that he got the vaccine and the next morning, then he stopped it. The patient clarified that he got the vaccine on Saturday (30Jan2021), stopped the blood thinner on Sunday (31Jan2021), the sickness subsided around Monday (as reported), but he still hasn&#39;t gone back on the blood thinner. He wanted to know when it was safe for him to start taking the blood thinner again, and he needed to know what to do for the second vaccine. The clinical course was as follows: He got the first dose of the vaccine on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 and at 22:00 he started feeling hot through the night. On Sunday, 31Jan2021, he had 103 degree fever, chills, body aches, and a headache. He clarified that he recovered completely by Wednesday, 03Feb2021. He had been on Eliquis for years for A-Fib. He stopped taking it once he got sick after getting the vaccine and went back and read the material and noticed what it said about the blood thinner. He did not go to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office. The action taken in response to the events for apixaban was temporarily withdrawn. The outcome of the events was recovered on 03Feb2021.  Follow-up (05Feb2021): This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer based on information received by Pfizer from Bristol-Myers Squibb (manufacturer control number US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY-BMS-2021-013684), license party for apixaban (ELIQUIS).  This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: #) on 05Feb2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 09Feb2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a patient and describes the occurrence of PYREXIA (103 degree fever), CHILLS, PAIN (bodyaches) and HEADACHE in 58-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) film-coated tablet (batch no. ABA8272S) for Cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis. CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included Covid-19 Vaccine injection for COVID-19 immunisation. Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure abnormal. On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (batch no. ABA8272S) (unknown route), 5 milligram twice a day. On 30Jan2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (unknown route) Unknown dose by injection in left arm. On 31Jan2021, an unknown time after starting Eliquis, the patient experienced PYREXIA (103 degree fever), CHILLS, PAIN (bodyaches) and HEADACHE. Eliquis (Unknown) was interrupted due to event. On 03Feb2021, PYREXIA, CHILLS, PAIN and HEADACHE resolved. DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 31Jan2021, Body temperature: 103 degree. For Eliquis (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                First started feeling upset stomach and severe headache, then a couple hours later, the body aches and joint pain set in. He said his lower body felt like he&#39;d been in a car accident. He couldn&#39;t keep anything down to take pain medicine all day long so was miserable all day until about 4pm when he was able to drink some water and take some Vicodin, which did not help. He was up and down all night long with the headache and body aches, and I gave him Excedrin about 6am and that finally started alleviating the headache. He took it again at 11am and was able to eat then, and is gradually been feeling better throughout the day. He was finally able to take his regular meds so now the body aches have subsided (48 hours after injection/36 hours after onset of symptoms).

Lasted 3 solid, then fever began to drop day 4, but headache persisted along with sweats and violent chill. No real appetite.  Also experienced body ache, but not as bad as other symptoms.  No, or little bowel movement during this time.  On day five (today) urine output is dark, but went 18 hours without Tylenol.  Piot to that i need 2 extra strength Tylenol every 5 hours for 4 days straight.  No nausea or vomiting associated with any of this.  I have extreme fatigue due the extreme headache pain keeping me awake.  Headache on the left and right side of the head, not front or behine the eyes, more over the ears.  Today I just feel wiped out by it all, but much improved.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccines previously, including allergy, flu, shingles and pneumonia.

At bedtime 3-11-21, I had a fever 100.1. At 0100, fever rose to 101.1. At 0500 fever rose to 102.6. During day on 3-12-21, I felt like I had the flu, fever broke mid-morning. on 3-13-21, I felt OK. On 3-15 and 16, I felt like I generally like I  had a flue bug. I felt better days later and then around March 21-24th I&#39;ve had a pretty continuous headache and neck ache which I have not had before the  vaccine. Lack of energy and feeling crappy. Scheduled for second vaccine April 2nd.

Every bone in the body felt like it was cracking. This lasted about 24 hours. I was also sweating a lot. The sweating at night lasted 3 days. I have the dry mouth and tongue with a thick layer of saliva and the mouth is swollen. I also have very dry eyes and nose/throat. These also are the after side effects of covid which i had in mid jan that i was getting better from. After taking the vaccine the symptoms of swollen mouth and thick saliva including dry eyes flared up again. Today is day number 6 after the vaccine and its a little better but not much.

It feels like all my nerve endings are on fire.  And when they are not on fire, they itch so bad, and I have scratched them so much, I have sores and scabs on my arms and legs from scratching a itch I can not reach.  Feels like the itching is under my skin.  Not on top.   1) Pain in ALL my body 2) High temperature - my house is 91 degrees and I&#39;m in a blanket and I&#34;m still cold 3) Even though I&#39;m cold - I sweat a lot 4) Have not been able to eat since I got the vaccine 8 days ago - growing very weak and loosing weight 5) I&#39;m dehydrated - Having trouble keeping liquids down 6) Bad stomach pains - sharp pains 7) Real bad gas and lots of it - Not normal for me 8) My kidneys hurt real bad - Probably clogged and overworked      I spend most of my time on the floor n my back.  Hurts too much to stand and walk   NOTE:  I&#39;m growing weak and very dehydrated.                   Something needs to be done soon !

I had not been able to keep down food in 10 days and for 3 days could not keep down liquids, so I went to the E/R. Pulse was down to 37bpm.  Blood had a high clotting factor as was starting to clot. Every nerve in my body felt like it was being electrified while on Fire at the same time!  Acute pain in my heart - Thought I was having a heart attack. High fever with chills and sweats.  Extreme dehydration.  And my kidneys hurt like hell.  They are taxed working overtime.   I was in such extreme pain, they had to shoot me up with Morphine every 4 hours to get it under control. They had to administer blood thinners to prevent clots.  I&#39;m still on blood thinners thanks to this damn vaccine! I was so dehydrated, they gave me 5 bags of IV Saline, a picture of Ice,  a picture of Water, then a picture of Tea, before I could even urinate.    I got to the E/R just in time before my heart stopped,  or before a clot formed and killed me.  Was in the hospital for 2 days.    I&#39;m home now, but still in pain.  I can&#39;t eat but force myself to drink liquids.  I do know if I will be getting any more vaccines...

A 58-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8734) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:00 at age of 58-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It also stated the patient was one of the most vulnerable against virus so he took the Covid-19 Vaccine. Medical history included ongoing cardiac failure congestive diagnosed probably 10 years ago, ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed probably 20 years ago, ongoing dialysis for 3.5 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing unspecified blood thinner. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t take any blood pressure medications and that she knew the patient took a blood thinner. Caller unable to provide further detail for the patient&#39;s medications as she doesn&#39;t have the patient&#39;s list of medications with her. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EP7534) injected in left arm in Mar2021 at age of 58-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fatigue after the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that it was hard to determine the cause of the fatigue because the patient was on dialysis, but that the patient has been more fatigued since he received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was a compromised fellow with a host of pre-existing conditions as far as heart disease, diabetes, and dialysis. Caller was calling in regard to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she was calling to report a bad reaction that her husband, the patient, received on Sunday, 04Apr2021, following his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Approximately 3 hours after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient had a full blown seizure at 15:00 on Sunday, 04Apr2021. Caller reported that she had to call emergency responders following the patient&#39;s seizure. The patient was doing better but the experience with his seizure was quite traumatic. Caller stated that if it was going to happen, it was going to happen to us. About 3 hours after receiving his Covid-19 vaccine on 04Apr2021, the patient became real sluggish and his speech started getting slow before the seizure occurred. Caller reported that the patient made a gradual descent downwards. Caller reported that she swears the patient has not been the same as far as fatigue goes since the patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior. Caller reported that she thought the fatigue was maybe from dialysis. The patient started to get slow just before the seizure, about 2.5 hours after he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was laying down following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s breathing was off. The patient&#39;s breath was heavier. Caller reported that after she noticed the patient&#39;s breathing was off, she asked the patient if he was ok. Caller reported that this is when she noticed that the patient&#39;s speech was really slow and that he was experiencing confusion. The patient has had no more seizure activity. The patient was still being monitored in the hospital. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t remember any of it. It&#39;s hard to say if the patient&#39;s sluggishness and fatigue were ongoing. Caller reported that she couldn&#39;t go see the patient while he was in the hospital but that the patient&#39;s voice sounds much stronger. For Confusion and Speech: Caller reported that the patient seems to be back/ returned to normal. Caller reported that she knew that the patient&#39;s cardiologist went to see the patient. The patient&#39;s cardiologist said that there was nothing that happened to the patient&#39;s heart, that what the patient experienced was not a heart issue, and that the event had no effect on the patient&#39;s heart. The medical staff stated that the seizure the patient experienced was related to a blood pressure drop. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s blood pressure was very low on 04Apr2021. The patient required a visit to Emergency Room for event seizure, no visit of physician office. Admitted on Sunday, 04Apr2021 for seizure, and still hospitalized. For investigations: Caller reported that the medical staff at the hospital definitely did lab work but she was not sure if any imaging was performed. Caller reported that she has no results available for tests that were performed. The outcome of events confusion and &#34;speech started to get slow&#34; was recovered in Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed.

Caller reported that she is very concerned if the patient should be getting a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine or not. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist informed the patient that the patient could get Covid-19 and die from that, but that the patient won&#39;t die from the allergic reaction he is experiencing. Caller reported that she questions the allergist&#39;s opinion because of the misery that the patient has been in. Caller stated that she just needs some answers. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist had stated that there was one other person that he was aware of that had a reaction 10 days after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that it was odd that the rash had started 10 days in, and reported that the patient ruled out food and ruled out any changes as the patient hadn&#39;t changed soap or laundry detergent recently.

Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist thinks the Covid-19 vaccine caused the patient&#39;s reaction. Caller reported that she and the patient are scared about whether he should get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and are unsure of what she and the patient should do at this point. Caller stated that she knows that people don&#39;t like to give advice, but that they say if you have immediate adverse reaction you shouldn&#39;t get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that the patient&#39;s reaction wasn&#39;t immediate, and asked if it the rash should still be considered an adverse reaction and the patient should not go get second the second dose, or should the patient go with what his doctor said as it is recommended that you should listen to physician. Body rash: Caller reported that the patient&#39;s rash has dissipated for the most part. Caller reported that the patient still has some redness in parts, but the itching has subsided at least as of this morning, 12Apr2021, when she spoke to the patient around 6:00 AM.

Caller reported that she believes the patient&#39;s hands have returned to normal at this point, reporting that the patient is at work and as a mechanic, the patient has to work with hands. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s primary care physician did take blood work, but the patient&#39;s allergist said that the results of the bloodwork would probably not be relevant based on fact that the patient was on medication at the point that the labs were drawn. Caller reported that she believed the initial prescription for prednisone was 10 mg tablets. Caller reported that the patient had to take 4 tablets the first day, 3 tablets the second day, 2 tablets the third day, and 1 tablet after that. Caller reported that she and the patient are concerned about the patient getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.

                                                &#34;I&#39;ve got 1st vaccination shot at 11 am 12/21/2020.    Got moderate (3 to 5 on 10-steps scale) pain in left upper arm/shoulder around 9 pm, limited mobility. Took 2 extra-strength Tylenols.    Between 2 and 3 am woke up because of severe headache (7 to 8), couldn&#39;t normally sleep because of that. Temperature 99.6 F. Another 2 Tylenols about 4 am. Not effective. Drinking a lot of water.    Decided to stay home. Contacted my supervisors by text and e-mail, left a voice message for EH.   8 am - another 2 Tylenols. Tried to sleep - slept till 1 pm. Headache improved (3-5), 99.3 F. Water and tea, minimal activity.    Received instructions from EH - to stay at home if any symptoms will take place, to get COVID test upon returning to the hospital.    Condition was improving during the day. Low pain and discomfort in the evening (2-3).    Sleeping normally during the night. No symptoms in the morning. No reason to delay returning to work.    Took COVID test at 9 am. Negative.    No symptoms since then&#34;

                                                Had my 2nd COVID vaccination shot at 2 pm on Monday, January 11, 2021.    Next morning - moderate pain in upper left arm/shoulder (place of injection). Working full shift.    Around 4 pm on Tuesday (after almost 3hrs OR case) - feeling very tired. Completed the working shift at 6 pm. Minor to moderate headache started to develop later in the evening. Two pills of Tylenol at 9 pm, another two around 2 am - while headache was getting worse.  @6:30 am Wednesday - informed managers that I&#39;ll have to stay off work because of bad headache (7 to 8 from 10), called EH as well.    During the day - mostly staying in the bed. Tylenol, water, tea with lemon, apples for hydration. Headache -- up and down (between 4 and 8), occasional fatigue and nausea (after staying upright more than 10-15 minutes), left upper arm pain, moderate pain in joints (knees, hips, low back). No fever.   Troubled night-time sleeping because of headache. 7 am - informed managers and EH about my condition, Got approval for another day off - with request to have a C-Test after that. Similar feeling and treatment.    Slow improvement during the day. Around 5 pm - feeling good enough to start moving more actively, headache and shoulder pain on low level, though getting tired quickly still.    Much better sleeping. No symptoms in the morning. Had a COVID test before returning to work.

Shot Info:  from 3/5 10am to 3/6, no issues, I didn&#39;t even feel the shot, no soreness or other symptoms.  woke up at 2am (first noticed):  Very sore arm, Sore from head to toes, headache, sever chills/shaking, very tired, severe shortness of breath, joints (knees, hips, wrist) constant (not overly severe) pain. Severe symptoms lasted for 24 hours before starting to taper off, felt pretty good by Sunday 3/7 12pm/Noon. My chills were so bad, just getting up to go to the restroom 15 ft away, didn&#39;t know if I could make it back to the bed. Headaches was the last thing to go.

[and no it was no urine! ;) ]  had to get new pajamas and throw a towel on the bed to have dry bedding.

                                                Immediate after the shot i had a weird taste  and slight feeling of nausea  which soon went away. Around 6 pm on the day of the injection I noticed that my taste buds were more sensitive. Following that I became very sluggish. So I went to bed shortly afterwards. The following morning I was still sluggish and there was a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. The feeling of tiredness an no energy started and continued until Wednesday the 3rd of March.  That morning I awaken feeling better. I still have a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. But overall I feel great.

Face and neck were turning purple. My dad was about to call 911 when he finally was able to calm down and catch his breath. His lungs and chest burned afterwards and he was completely spent for days after.

Pt was recently transitioned from haldol decanoate to clozapine.  Last dose haldol decanoate was on 2/16/21. First dose clozapine 12.5 mg was on 2/24/21. Increased to 12.5 BID the following day. Increased to 25 mg BID on March 2, without reported side effects or other issues.  Pt got his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on March 4, and that night was less engaged with staff, felt feverish. Did not spike a temp per bedside accompaniment who was with him that day. The following day, he barely ate any food and did not get out of bed all day. This continued for the entirety of the weekend - bed bound, turning to look at staff when called but did not engage/respond verbally. He was incontinent of urine over the weekend.  Treated for Neuroleptic malignant syndrome 2/2 clozapine  Uncertain if vaccine contributed to event, but recent case report published relating clozapine toxicity and Pfizer COVID vaccine, so submitting to VAERS for evaluation

I went to see medical center on Thursday. I tested negative for Covid 19 and Strep. This pain persisted until today, March 28 (4 days)

A 59-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 06Mar2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pain, high cholesterol, and testosterone low, joint pain, bone pain, muscle pain, any place in his body had pain, and doesn&#39;t have good memory, all ongoing. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydrocodone for pain, ongoing atorvastatin for high cholesterol, ongoing clomiphene citrate for testosterone medication because it was low because of his age, ongoing colecalciferol (Vitamin D), ongoing ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), ongoing oxycodone for pain, and unspecified eye medication. He had many different medications that he was taking. Historical vaccines included chicken pox vaccine for immunization and shingles vaccine in Jan2020 for immunization and experienced pain all over. The patient stated that he was a torture survivor and he has been taking pain medication because of him being tortured previously. He was taking medications for the pain, clarified to be hydrocodone and oxycodone. These medications kept his body stable. He was able to sleep and relax. One day after he received his Pfizer COVID vaccine (07Mar2021), he started feeling the pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse but the pain used to be stable with the way he was using his medicines. But now his body was not stable. Any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously because of the damage of torture but now it all came up after the COVID vaccine. Every piece of his body hurt even if he takes his medications. He still had the pain and his body was so weak for about 4 to 5 hours. He used to be able to do his business all day but now after about 3 to 4 hours on his feet he got so tired and he needed to sit. He didn&#39;t know why this happened. He has talked to others that have received COVID vaccines and none have had this kind of reaction like him. He has asked them about it. It was very frustrating to him on an unspecified date. Every month he sees a physician. He would like for Pfizer to contact him with further questions, he can&#39;t understand the pain. This was really killing him especially when the pain goes to his bones. He will keep him up until 3 in the morning and he stays awake on an unspecified date. He then took medicine and he had to wait for 30 minutes for it to start working and then he will be able to sleep. But other than that, the pain jumped. He has had the chicken pox and the shingles vaccines and none did like that. The pain was not going away in his muscles or joints. And now he was getting a headache on an unspecified date, it was really frustrating. He didn&#39;t have good memory from the torture. This morning, when he woke up, he had the pain in his joints and his bones. He didn&#39;t like to use too much medication. He liked to use it only as he needs it. Pain medications are strong. But this COVID vaccine somehow made him need to use more medication and then that caused him to have a headache. His pain should get better with his medications but today, he had pain all over him and he didn&#39;t have any energy to move. He didn&#39;t know how to explain it. The COVID vaccine had really kind of made him weak. Sometimes he drinks a lot of cranberry juice to try and take the vaccine out of his system and it was frustrating because he hasn&#39;t ever been like this. When he had pain like this it reminded him of his torturing and what had happened to him. When the pain came on strong was when it reminded him of that. The medications he was taking were supposed to kill the pain. That was the reason he got so pissed and was trying to ask what was going on. This COVID vaccine is not safe he believed because it has been almost 10 days and it was not helping him. He was still not good. After he got his COVID vaccine on 06Mar2021, he had a little bit of small itching, not much, just a little bit that made him feel not comfortable with it. That was why they kept him for 20 minutes after his vaccine. When he got back home, he was okay, it was nothing serious. But then the day after his COVID vaccine on 07Mar2021, his joints, his muscles and his bones had pain. On 06Mar2021 the itching lasted about 20 minutes. He felt like he was chewing his lip, he was a little uncomfortable and he felt his ribs moving quicker. Nothing happened but he could feel it. He tried to chew his lips a couple of times, but not that much. But after that, he had pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine, 07Mar2021. By the time this vaccine started getting into his body, it was really hurting and getting worse. He had the shingles vaccine and for 1 1/2 to 2 days, he had pain all over and then 2 days after it was all gone, he was back to normal life. The pain was gone. With this COVID vaccine he thought that maybe it was going to be the same but it was not the same and it was hurting. The shingles vaccine was last year in 2020, 3 months before people knew about the coronavirus that was when he got the vaccine for shingles, so maybe Jan2020 was when he had the shingles vaccine. He had no medical conditions or heart and chest problems. No other vaccine he has taken has ever had this type of side effect to him. He took his shingles vaccine in his right arm and the COVID vaccine was in his left. With both he had the same start of having the bad pain. This COVID vaccine goes deeply to the body. The vaccines job is to wake the body. The vaccine&#39;s job is to wake up the body for the virus. The body has to make some kind of soldiers to stand up on the virus and this COVID vaccine had actually made his body weak. After the vaccine is supposed to wake the body, little by little the side effects are supposed to go away. His body was not learning this vaccine. It kept fighting to learn whatever was in this COVID vaccine, his body can&#39;t learn it and fight it. That was the reason his body got weak and the pain has not gone away. His body is still in alert and that&#39;s why the pain was still there. His body was still fighting. Somehow it didn&#39;t match the inside of the body. Maybe for some people that this will happen to, they will be okay but for some they will not be okay. It is not because some people have nothing wrong with them. The patient recovered from itching and discomfort on 06Mar2021; not recovered from any place in his body, his muscles, joints, and bones have had pain previously/ pain in his joints and his bones and it was getting worse/ pain all over on the day after his COVID vaccine; while outcome of other events was unknown.

A 59-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, lot number: EM6208), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15Mar2021 11:00 (received at 59-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient just got his second Pfizer shot Monday 12Apr2021 10:45 am (lot number: EW0162) administered in Arm Right, and he got his first one on 15Mar2021. He wants to report what he thinks is a side effect. He does not know if it is related or not, but at the end of Mar2021/ beginning of Apr2021, he started having excess mucous. He has fits where he is trying to cough up mucous for 45 minutes. Ever since it started there has been a lot of mucous. He has been taking Benadryl and stuff like that. He headed to urgent care on 11Apr2021 but decided to go to the ER (emergency room) instead because he was having a mucous coughing spell. They checked for pneumonia, but it was negative. The chests x-ray was clear with no pneumonia. They are saying it is allergies, but he has never had a reaction like this with mucous.  He has been wearing his mask too. He knows the allergy season is supposed to be bad, but they said on the news the masks were actually helping with the allergies. That people were having less symptoms. They were contributing it to allergies, but he has never had them this way before. He wants to report because he is thinking maybe it was something from having the vaccine. He thinks the mucous first started the end of Mar2021 or the first day of Apr2021. He went to ER on 11Apr2021. He also went back and forth with the doctor. They gave him allergy medicine. The ER gave him codeine cough syrup and Allegra D. His GP has him on Sudafed now, Flonase, Allegra, and Benadryl. He has fits at night nothing seems to change.

No fever, no dizziness or passing out. Diagnosis: Dilated cardiomyopathy (I42.0) -Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 25-30. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis. His weight had increased from 217 lbs to 227 lbs - reported shob but no edema, they discussed increasing furosemide (LASIX) to 40/d from 20 daily for a week and reassess. Also suspect COVID vaccine related immune phenomenon. Treatment received for the events (Dilated cardiomyopathy, Left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac amyloidosis and weight gain). Events (has increased on fatigue, cannot take breath well occasionally on exertion, abdominal swelling, weight gain and dry cough since COVID shot) onset date was on unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported cardiac amyloidosis, Dilated cardiomyopathy, and the administration of the COVID19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations. More information on the patient&#39;s medical history, underlying medical conditions would be helpful for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.
