Now, he was getting symptoms of COVID 2 nights ago (around 20:00 28Dec2020) such as fever, chills, body felt cold, fever. Last night (30Dec2020) when he slept, he sweated a lot. Maybe it is one of the reasons.  He did not have a fever, but he sweated a lot.  He felt like his shirt was wet in the morning. He also had sore throat and lost his sense of smell on 06:00 31Dec2020. It is weird. He never had that before.  He doesn&#39;t know what the do. If it was normal or it was symptoms of COVID. Second one will be on 12Jan2020. Should he get tested for COVID. Wanted to know if he should get the second dose. The outcome of events, fever, chill, felt cold, sweating a lot was recovering. The outcome of sore throat and cannot smell anything was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The following day I had mild muscle soreness and injection site pain without swelling or redness.

The first couple days I had a really sore left arm, but didn?t feel any ?side effects? until about Wednesday, 1/6 (about a week later). I remember waking up to a sore left side of my upper body. The left side of my neck, chest, arm, and lymph node (under my left arm) felt weird. It was until about Saturday night, 1/9, that I felt my left under arm lymph node noticeably swollen. I had a bad headache and loss of energy, and overall feeling unwell. No fever or night sweats to report. I was absent from work on 1/11 and 1/12, as a result.  1/13 was my first day back and feel better. The swollen left lymph node is no longer present, but still slightly tired. I did not seek Medical Care for my symptoms.

I woke up at about 2:00 in the morning on 08Jan2021 nd I couldn&#39;t even really move but then I was up for most of the night. My temperature is like  between 102.6 and 103.5 and my back hurts really bad. So, I am hoping that these are normal things but I am curious at any point is there something I should watch out for taking on that stuff further. The first shot was not anywhere near to bad which I know is to be expected but the second one being the worse, it&#39;s like dramatic, I have had a fever for I don&#39;t know like eighteen hours. Is there anything I should just make sure, or like this can be a normal side effect, correct?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.

He stated that he never gets headaches and was on a pain scale of 7-8 at that time.  Vitals were taken. BP 135/86, pulse 91, temp 96.4. We dosed the patient with 1000mg of Tylenol at 3:05pm.  At 3:15, the patient stated that his headache had increased to a pain scale of 9.  He wasn&#39;t doing well so the staff laid him down.  At this point the staff felt it was a situation that needed more attention.  They took the patient to the ER where he was given saline and something for headache.  The also drew labs. Not sure what labs they drew.

A 40-year-old male patient started to receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 21Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), COVID-19 in 2020 (Jun2020 or Jul2020; tested positive for COVID-19 at that time and has 3 tests after that which were all negative) and since then lost weight (2020), and root canal. The patient had no issues with vaccines in the past. There were issues with the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, because he would be positive to TB, but this is because of his culture, he is from a specific country, and so they cannot take that vaccine. The patient clarified that he did not take the TB vaccine, what he meant was he is aware he can&#39;t take it. On 21Dec2020, the patient works in healthcare and had a patient that came in that tested positive for COVID-19 and so because of that, everyone including him that came in contact with the COVID-19 positive patient had to check and get tested. This happened the same day as his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the test (Dec2020) came out negative. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had not had any antibody test for COVID-19. The patient asked the doctor, but she never scheduled him for that, until after last month, she talked to him about it, but by that time he told her that he doesn&#39;t need it now - it&#39;s been almost a year. The patient had the first dose on 21Dec2020 and at that time he did experience symptoms the next day (22Dec2020). At that time after the first dose administration (21Dec2020), he could not lift his arm and it was bruised under the arm. The next day (22Dec2020), he had back pain, with his neck he could not turn it (neck pain), he could not be on his left side where he got the shot on left arm, it was like that for 3 days. Then on Thursday (24Dec2020), he had headache every time he bended his head down, he would be sleeping and would wake up in middle of night because of the headache, it felt like a sinus headache on one side of the head, and when he bend his head down, he would feel it, it stayed this way till 29Dec2020 (Tuesday). The patient has a question trying to find out with his employer. They told them they need to take the vaccine, they pushed them to take the vaccine, he works in healthcare. If they get sick at the job, he asked if they (employer) would pay for it, how would he get paid. The job told him he gets paid sick days and asked how they would do that. The patient asked how long the vaccine was alive in the body and how does it work. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

She had symptoms too, but she normally get sinusitis this time of year. No one had a fever. Her son was really congested. Maybe he will develop a fever down the line. She was at a quandary. She had to quarantine in case it was. Could the vaccination cause a positive COVID test result. She thought the symptoms should show up in 1 to 3 days. A week in between her husband and son and it was hard to believe. It should have been her to get it worse since she sleeps with her husband. Praise the Lord she had not.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receipt of the vaccine, I experienced tachycardia and mild throat swelling.  I was placed in the Immunizations Clinic treatment room, had my airway assessed, and vital signs taken.  My initial vital signs at 0950 were BP 197/99, HR 106, O2 sat 99%, temp 98.3 F, and 0/10 pain.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, I repeatedly had my vital signs taken, was monitored, was provided with water, and remained hypertensive and tachycardic, although down-trending.  I also experienced cottonmouth and bilateral blurred vision/dry eye.  At the end of the 2 hour monitoring, the throat swelling seemed to subside, my systolic BP in the mid 140s and diastolic BP was in the mid 90s.  At time of release from monitoring, I felt better, but dry eyes and dry mouth continued without difficulty swallowing.  I was instructed to report to the ER if my symptoms worsened and to consult by primary care manager about the incident.  Upon walking back to my office, I realized I was experiencing dizziness as well and a mild headache.  I attempted to submit this form online but I received an error message, so I completed the fillable version to upload, in case a partial duplicate record appears.

On 1/11/21 the headache  worsened to 4/10 and was associated with myalgias and neck stiffness.  After a jog, I was in the shower and noticed a rash all over my body that had been pruritic.  I went to the ER that night where I tested negative for flu A/B and also tested negative for covid (Antigen then PCR).  Got a CMP, CBC, and coags to rule out ITP.  everything was normal.  The symptoms were so bad I stayed home from work on 1/12/21.  Over the next few days the rash improved and the headache slowly went away

                                                After 1st Pfizer shot I experienced the worst headache of my life 4-6 hours after the shot with localized pulsation in my right temporal region prior to the headache.   The headache persisted through the night and I could not sleep and did not decrease with over the counter medication, my pain was rated 9/10 to 10/10 in the same area the pulsation happened.  This headache continued for 4-6 hours at a severe level than for another 6-8 hours at a moderate to severe level.  I ended up checking in at the Emergency department that I worked at after my shift and got labs and CT scan, this was after my symptoms resolved.    I thought that I might have had a head bleed and wish I would have gotten my CT earlier when experiencing the symptoms.    I was not provided a vaccine disclosure sheet or any information on what to do if experience severe symptoms or what symptoms to expect.  I am upset that I was not provided guidance about what to expect and how to manage post vaccine symptoms, I would have gone into ED sooner with this information and feel I may have missed possible diagnosis due to lack of disclosure and guidance.

On Mon heart rate increased again. Went to Urgent Care and tested covid negative. On Wed 12/30, BP at 180/105. Went to ED and BP eventually went down to 145/95. Dr is speculating that since patient had high antibodies from covid infection in August and still high antibodies in October that all of this is a wild immune reaction triggered by the vaccine.

A 41-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand Pfizer/BioNTech, lot EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 28Dec2020 11:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) and PFO (patent foramen ovale). He had no known drug allergy. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]. On 10Jan2021, he began having mild headaches. On 11Jan2021 the headaches worsened to about 4/10 associated with myalgias, neck stiffness and a diffuse pruritic rash over his whole body. To return to work he had to go get tested so he went to the ER, got Flu A/B test, Covid antigen, then PCR test, a CBC, CMP, and coags (to rule out ITP). All tests were normal, Nasal Swab was negative. Treatment given was Normal saline bolus and ketorolac 30mg IV. The outcome of events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  ~~~

                                                Patient screened for first dose of Pfizer vaccine. He checked no history of allergies or reactions to medications or vaccines. In the initial screening he informed me he had a phobia of needles but this is usually with blood draws. He reported he should be fine with vaccinations. I inquired on previous reactions and he denied any allergic reaction just that he does not like them. I asked him how I can help give the vaccine. We had him look away and to think of a different situation. I asked him if he would like to know when I am administering or just use distraction. He chose to be informed when he would feel a slight poke. Vaccine was administered with no issues.  Within the minute following the vaccine patient started to feel dizzy. Hung his head a bit but was responsive. I requested staff assistance to help the situation including RN to prevent any episodes of syncope.  We provided water which he was able to drink. He was still seated and we suggested putting head between legs. This was not comfortable for him so we moved him to the floor. About 3-4 min in he began to sweat a bit more and appeared Pale. We obtained a BP and pulse. BP was 112/60 and pulse around 60.  When he felt hot, sweaty and appeared pale we all decided to call EMS to be cautious. He maintained BP, no SOB, did not lose conscious. EMS evaluated him, med list provided and vitals. He was on medications for anxiety.  They released him after about 30min and reported a panic attack and not related to the vaccine.  Patient walked out of the clinic with his partner and was stable. He is requesting 2nd dose of the vaccine. I informed him nurse would review and would have a plan for future injection.

                                                I felt fine at first for the 15 minutes they held me for observation. But as I walked out to my car I quickly got heavy and tired and started to ache and have a headache. I had to rest in my car for a while before driving home. Once home I crashed immediately for around 4 hours in the middle of the day which is not like me. I had an important dinner meeting i had to attend for my livelihood. I thought I was feeling better but half way through Dinner  I started feeling bad again. Got to the point that I stopped eating and excused myself to get home and rest. Symptoms progressed rapidly. Unfortunately I was pulled over for a minor traffic stop and  tried to explain that I was having a bad reaction to the vaccine and needed to get home. They wouldn?t believe me  and torturously treated me like an OVI. I?m hoping that I can get some kind of documentation and or assistance. I have court on the 1st and it will be devastating if I am convicted. I was not intoxicated  and was not warned about the dangers of driving after the vaccine. Please call me. I need help

The patient was worried because everything was coming to a head right now. The caller got the first shot, he waited for 15 minutes and felt fine. As the caller walked to his car he began feeling heavy, had severe diarrhea, headache, aching, it was almost like he passed out, it felt like he went to sleep. The patient got home and crashed 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day and woke up feeling really bad. The patient went to a very important dinner meeting that night. While the patient was at the meeting he went to the bathroom a few times and then excused himself because he felt so bad. The patient did not even finish one cocktail with dinner. The caller got pulled over for a minor traffic stop, cutting the corner and crossing the line or something small. The officers believed the caller was driving under the influence and started making him do a sobriety test with 40 degree wind gusts, the patient was miserable. The caller told the officers that he needed to seek medical attention but they ignored him. The officers forced the caller to do the urine test.

He stated that he had been having &#34;muscle ache, chills and severe headache, the headache is so severe, the most disturbing one.&#34; He reported that one of the Tylenol doses was administered to him by the nurse that administered the vaccine. He reported that he took some Tylenol and ibuprofen but this time it was not helping. He stated that he received the vaccine about 24 hours ago and started to experience muscle ache, chills and severe headache roughly about 6 hours after the administration. He reported that &#34;I could hang in, but it was getting too bad, my head wanted to fall off, so I am driving home now so I could not work.&#34; When the patient was asked about the vaccine dose and route he stated &#34;I believe normal dose I believe, I cannot remember I cannot recap anything, but I know it was administered in my left arm, my left arm is too sore the way it was administered.&#34; He stated that he received the vaccination for prevention and to be on the safe side. The patient stated that he did lab work with his doctor a few months ago, probably around 6 or 7 months ago. The clinical outcome of the events &#34;muscle ache&#34;, &#34;chills&#34;, &#34;headache is so severe most disturbing one; it was getting too bad, my head want to fall off, I could not work&#34; were all not recovered/not resolved, while the clinical outcome of the event &#34;left arm is too sore way it was administered&#34; was unknown.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Denies any fevers recorded at home. He feels like he has extra beats intermittently. Also reports some nausea, but denies vomiting or diarrhea. He has maintained good PO intake since symptoms started, but is worried he may be a bit dehydrated because he had a small AKI when he had covid back in March?.  Etiology of chest pains unclear, but given all of the above workup, unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac or pulmonary etiology.&#34;  He continued to have palpitations for the next week and had further EKG&#39;s don thru urgent care.

                                                I was vaccinated on 1/2/2021 and developed oral parasthesias the day of the vaccination. On day 3 after the vaccine, I developed a severe headache with ?brain fog,? confusion, and hyperacusis. The headache has now persisted for 10 days and was severe enough that I missed several days of work this week as I was unable to carry out my clinical duties. I was seen in ED this past weekend and ultimately followed up with neurology after the headache had persisted for 7&#43; days. The working theory is that I may have developed aseptic meningitis as a side effect of the vaccine and I am currently on a steroid taper which has resulting in partial but significant improvement in my symptoms. I am back at work but still experiencing a mild headache and facial parasthesias. I did request a Covid test in ED 1 on 1/10/21 and tested negative.

                                                About 3 minutes after receiving the shot, I became dizzy.  After 15 minutes, I was still dizzy.  I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

                                                About 72 hours after receiving the vaccination i was shivering uncontrollably on and off, breaking out in sweats on and off. Once i would start to feel better after sleeping 4-6 hours. I get out of bed thinking I was better, then another hour or so later the symptoms were back, so I would go back to bed shivering uncontrollably off and on again, sweating and uncomfortable until falling back to sleep.. This lasted for about 48 hours, which started 72 after receiving my vaccination.  No adverse symptoms the first 2 days following the vaccination. I got vaccinated on Tuesday, 1/19/21 - symptoms started Friday, 1/22/21 - Saturday, 1/23/21.  Sunday, 1/24/21 I finally felt normal again.

Hypothermia.  Couldn&#39;t get warm.  It&#39;s like my body forgot  how to regulate temperature. I&#39;ve only ever experienced similar coming out of anesthesia after surgery.  Took wearing multiple layers of clothes AND multiple blankets just to stabilize my body temp.  It lasted for around 2-3 hours.  This wasn&#39;t normal &#34;chills&#34;.  This was whole-body shaking hypothermia.  Entire body sore afterwards from the involuntary shaking.  Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get an actual reading as anything to measure body temp was downstairs and I didn&#39;t want to risk falling.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

                                                Felt immediate headache, followed by extreme exhaustion, fatigue, body aches (the same day as the 2nd dose) within about 10 minutes after it; and for the next two days. Felt better by 02/14/2021. Began feeling ill again on 02/17/2021, body aches, extreme fatigue, feeling very hot but not having a fever, nausea. It seemed to get better on about 02/21/2021, but then on 02/22/2021, all of the same feelings and symptoms came back and are still present today. I have reached out to my primary doctor to let him know and he suggested that I submit this information here as well.

                                                On Monday I had the COVID vaccination. I noticed no side effects on Tuesday other than tenderness at the injection site. On Wednesday, I noticed light bruising up and down my arms. Thursday morning around 10 AM, I started to have side effect - some so severe they must be documented. At 10 AM, I felt lightheaded and had brain fog. By noon my head was pounding with a headache followed by an upset stomach. At 2 PM things started getting bad and continued to worse. It was not the headache or stomach that need to be noted but a sudden and severe onset of depression and anxiety. - Depression like I have not felt in years when I was at my worst. Throughout the day the depression worsened and by 7 PM, I was unable to stop crying and was overwhelmed with anxiety and  PTSD panic attacks. While I have the training to understand  this is temporary, - I am very worried about what I?m feeling , because there was no warning or mention of this side effect. I have the resources needed for this but people that are more fragile need to prepare for the sudden o set of critical/ debilitating depression.

The fatigue really started to set in on Friday evening (29Jan2021), it was like he got hit by a truck.  He was typically a high energy person and its very out of the ordinary for him to feel this way. He normally has class on Saturday from 9-noon but he had to cancel going with the amount of fatigue he was experiencing. He also had some cognitive fuzziness on Jan2021. His fatigue was still there, but it has gotten a little better. He was normally very high energy, but he missed two classes and skipped his internship today. He doesn&#39;t feel like himself. He also has had frequent urination which he noticed probably Friday night (29Jan2021), all the way up until now. However, he has been drinking a lot of water. The patient received a test/report showing he has no chromosomal issues and no likelihood of issues on an unspecified date. The outcome of soreness at the point of administration of his left arm and Frequent urination was not recovered; Muscle soreness/muscle soreness at the point of injection spread to his whole body and fatigue was recovering; it was like aches all over his body and cognitive fuzziness was unknown.

They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

Almost a week after I started getting sick, aches, shore throat, headache and fever (101.5F) that is when I went to the ED and it lasted about 2 days and then it went away. At the ED they did COVID and strep tests both negative. This was with my first dose and my second one the same thing happened.

                                                The day after receiving the second vaccination, I began to have mild intermittent abdominal pain2-3/10.  The pain gradually increased, became more intense, and more constant.  Mild fever and chills started happening, and I took Ibuprofen.  By about 4 days after the vaccine, the abdominal pain was severe enough that I had some difficulty walking and I couldn?t sleep at night.  Pain was 6-8/10.  I went to the ER, and CT scan with IV contrast showed 18 mm appendicitis.  I underwent laparoscopic surgery and it was found to be perforated.  It was removed.  I am currently recovering in the hospital.  I received the vaccine as a health care provider at my hospital, specifically I am a practicing pediatrician physician for over 10 years.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

                                                After the required wait period of 15 minutes I started to drive back home which is 77 miles from the hospital that administered the vaccination.  Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

Reminded me of how one feels when they get a good case of the Flu. As the day progressed all symptoms lessened in severity and I went to bed at about 20% of what I felt that morning. I woke the following morning and felt no residual symptoms.

A 43-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3248) in right deltoid, on 11Jan2021 around 10:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was in high risk group, was living in senior facility and was disabled. Medical history included also ongoing hydrocephalus diagnosed when he was less than a year old, ongoing shunt (the first one when he was 11 months old, has had multiple revisions since then, the last in 2017), vagal nerve stimulator implantation ongoing from 2003 (for epilepsy; has had multiple since then, last one in 2015), ongoing hemiparesis since he was a baby and epilepsy (he was taking epilepsy drugs but it was well controlled). Concomitant medications included oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) ongoing from 2000, at 1800 mg daily (600 mg in the morning and 1200 mg at night), for epilepsy and levetiracetam (KEPPRA XR) ongoing from 2000, at 1500 mg twice daily (in the morning and at night), for epilepsy. He was on prior medications to these, since he was young. Over the years he has changed to newer and better medications. On 11Jan2021 around 8-9 PM the patient experienced seizure. The patient has not had a grand mal seizure in over 5 years. On an unspecified date in Jan2021, after the vaccine, his whole body felt sore. He was unsure if it was from the seizure or the vaccine. The reporter also noticed that the patient had been coughing quite a bit on 12Jan2021 morning. Events outcomes were unknown.

I also began having heartburn/indigestion.It has been 16 days since the first dose, and the loose stool and  heartburn/indigestion remain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (HCP [patient]). A 43-year-old male patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, lot number and exp date not reported), intramuscular (vaccine location: left arm) on 28Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. Medical history included gastric sleeve and surgery. The patient had no known allergies. Patient did not have Covid prior vaccination. There was no other medical history. There were no concomitant medications. There were no other vaccine/s within four weeks. No other medications in two weeks. The day after patient received the vaccine, she got the common side effects on Jan2021: chills, loose stool, and nausea. She also began having heartburn/indigestion (Jan2021). It had been 16 days since the first dose, and the loose stool and heartburn/indigestion remain. Not sure if it&#39;s because of having the gastric sleeve done years ago, or not, as the surgery changed her metabolism and the like. No treatment was provided. Nasal Swab on 11Jan2021 was negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

Follow ups with ENT, Neuro and PCP have continued with Vestibular Rehabilitation. While in ER, the MRI, MRA, CT, CT with Contrast was done, showed no signs of anything that could have caused this. Ironically tracking back, I received my 2nd Dose of the Pfyzer Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. and this occurred on February 13th at 2:15 a.m. I have not had any other issues before this nor any signs of damage to the nerve or ear that regularly affects Vertigo Patients per my Neuro and ENT. The incident took place 4 weeks and 2 days after the 2nd vaccine. 2 days after the 2nd dose, I experienced Low grade fever, chills, and body aches that lasted only 12 hours, but nothing with the 1st vaccine nor anything after the 2nd dose issue until the Vertigo.  I am unable to drive, conduct my job, which requires me to go to emergency calls and carry a Taser (CEW). I have been off work since this occurred and still not eligible to go back to work.

He went home as he was not feeling well however proceeded to have another 2-3 episodes of loss of consciousness at home witnessed by his girlfriend--the later 2 occurred while lying down and were not clearly associated with any presyncopal symptoms.

                                                extremely bad dry mouth; lips were going numb; facial numbness; rash from his neck to his nipple line; BP was 180/110 / BP stayed around 160/100; felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling; felt flush; uncomfortable; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A 44-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, intramuscularly on 21Dec2020 14:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included gluten allergy with causes dermatitis herpetiformis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. The patient previously took Benadryl and experienced allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that immediately after receiving vaccine on 21Dec2020, he felt an &#34;amped&#34; feeling and felt flush. It was uncomfortable but not alarming at first. About ten minutes after shot, he started to have extremely bad dry mouth. He went back to work, but he went back downstairs after feeling like he was getting seriously ill and his lips were going numb. His BP was 180/110. The facial numbness went away but his BP stayed around 160/100. He was asked to go to ER, but he refused because he would have to pay for it and he was feeling better. He also noticed after going back upstairs that he had a rash from his neck to his nipple line. The doctor asked for Benadryl, but he was not given due to possible Benadryl allergy. He went home and his BP returned to normal 2 hours later. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in 21Dec2020 for blood pressure increased and facial numbness, and recovered on an unspecified date for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the BP increased and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG and chemistry panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Throughout the 15 minutes the sensation began to radiate throughout my body and extremities. I waited about 20 minutes before deciding to leave the facility and proceed with my afternoon.  Once I got home, I experienced chills, which I read on the pamphlet was an expected side effect. Both hands and feet were cold and I put on additional layers and lied on the couch and rested. During that time I began to notice the tingling sensation/paresthesia predominantly in the injected (right) arm, but also sporadically in other parts of my body including thigh (front/back), left arm, elbow, back, torso, neck, head, wrists, buttocks, etc. This sensation continued as I prepared for bed and continues as of this writing.  It&#39;s difficult to say whether the sensation is getting better or worse, but it is consistent best described as someone pricking you every so often.

I had trouble getting warm and had to utilize multiple blankets to gain heat, which is not normal.  I was very warm and most likely developed a fever.  I did not eat until 2 PM that day and the started feeling better later that night.  I was forced to miss work to recover.  I returned to work today, 1/28 but I remain tired and a little lethargic.

This 44-year-old Nurse (Patient) reported that he received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown) at single dose for vaccination in Jan2021 around 9:45am. Relevant medical history included ongoing Mild shrimp allergy  and ongoing Hypertension. Relevant concomitant drugs included amlodipine at 10 mg once daily for Hypertension since Feb2020 and ongoing. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None.  Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was None. The patient was administered the COVID Vaccine around 9:45am; about 10 minutes later he had onset of little muscle twitches on the left side of his body that started in the calf then the glute, then the quadricep, then the bicep and then just started bouncing around everywhere on left side. Approximately a half an hour after that those little muscle twitches started on the right side of his body. Now the little muscle twitches are just everywhere; his hand, his heel, right now as he is speaking he is having the little muscle twitches in his heel; This event has been ongoing since onset; but changed today around 5:00am when he felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines which is probably impossible, but it feels like it is not just muscular now, like it is happening in his intestines which concerns him. The little muscle twitches do not hurt, he thinks that is probably why he has waited a week to call; but the fact that they are ongoing and changed today, worsened is unsettling. He reported since that first dose of COVID Vaccine was administered he has also had low grade fever; muscle soreness; muscle tiredness. He reported that a rapid response team was called immediately because of the initial reaction he had. Later that day his hands were a little shaky, he got very diaphoretic and the nurses on the unit of the hospital said he almost fell which he does not recall at all; in response to those events he was taken to the emergency department where they did a complete workup including labs: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), checked his heart and everything was fine; no notable results from any of those tests. The patient was not admitted to the hospital; under observation in emergency room only. Outcome of events Little muscle twitches, Low grade fever, Muscle soreness and Muscle soreness was not resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

By 1600 I had extreme fatigue and severe mental fogginess.  This fogginess lasted approximately 24 hours.  Other reactions included chills, fever, myalgia, arthralgia, headache as expected.  I feel the mental effects could put patients in danger if healthcare practitioners are not aware of the possibility of this and receive the vaccine while on duty.  I did not experience this with the first dose.

                                                Starting from the first night after the vaccination and each and every night after that to date of this form completion, I have had extremely interrupted sleep.  I have woken up several times in the middle of the night (i.e., 2 am, 4 am, etc..). Each time I have woken up and felt wide awake and difficulty going back to sleep.  As a consequence each of the following days after this poor sleep I have been in extreme fatigue and not able to function properly.  I do not have any other notable side effects.  No fever or major headaches.  This disturbed sleep which coincidentally started right after the vaccination is highly concerning for me, especially since it has happened on 4 consecutive nights.  This has not happened to me before.  In the past even if I woke up in the middle of the night, I would fall back asleep relatively quickly.  Furthermore, it has not been the case of this type of lack of sleep for this many consecutive nights. Another observation is that my feeling of hunger seems to have increased for some reason.  Even in the middle of the night when I wake up I have felt great hunger and then starting in the morning that hunger continues.  This is more hunger than normal for me.  My diet and eating patterns have not changed compared to what it was before getting the first dose of the vaccination. Given that today is Martin Luther King Day and a Holiday my PCP is closed, so could not make an appointment or report this to her.  I will call my PCP again tomorrow, 01/19/21. If this disturbed sleep continues, then I am sure how I can properly function during a normal work day on the job. Given all the above I am also concerned about the second dose of the vaccination and what side effects that may result in.

                                                Received  second dose of  Pfizer COVID vaccination on January 9, 2021. At the time of the vaccination he experienced discomfort of  left deltoid (site of injection) as well as paresthesia at the injection site. He also experienced systemic symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias for 24 to 36 hours. Over the course of the next several days he experienced continued significant numbness and weakness in left upper extremity, specifically in left deltoid muscle. By Sunday 1/17/2021 the significant left deltoid weakness and numbness persisted, specifically not being able to lift his arm greater than 45 degrees using his deltoid. He contacted health on 1/17/2021. On 1/19/2021 he had a consultation with a physician. Based upon his clinical examination, and symptom complex, physician does not believe that this is a cervical spine issue but rather a local nerve injury related to the injection site. He was prescribed a steroid taper. Unclear whether this is temporary or permanent issue.

A 45-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Batch/lot number: EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 13Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced fatigue on 17Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, achiness in his legs and hands on 18Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, chills on 18Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, injection site swelling and achiness on 13Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Jan2021. The patient reported after he got the first COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021 he experienced fatigue, achiness, and injection site swelling. Patient wanted to know if this is normal after the first dose and this was discussed. Patient explained that the fatigue - this didn&#39;t start until 17Jan2021 and was ongoing. On 18Jan2021 he starting having achiness in his legs and hands and he also had a few chills today. The injection site swelling and achiness there, was gone after the 14Jan2021. Patient was really looking for an answer to his question on if it was normal or should he get a COVID test. He was on day 5 after getting the vaccine and from what he read most people have side effects within a 24 hours and gone within 48 hours. Some of his side effect didn&#39;t start until 4 days later. The Vaccination Facility Type was hospital. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Patient did not go to Emergency Room or Physician Office. There was no Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks).

A 45-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK9231), intramuscular n deltoid left on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At the time of vaccination he experienced discomfort in left deltoid which was the injection site, cannot lift his arm greater than 45 degrees, local nerve injury, systemic fatigue ,myalgia and other arthralgia for 24-36 hours, developed significant numbness and weakness in his upper extremities specifically in his left deltoid muscle, affects his ability to perform usual work or task, all in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown.  He called the employee health on 17Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he saw a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon didn&#39;t think it was a cervical spine injury rather a local nerve injury related to the injection itself and he was prescribed a steroids taper, unclear whether if it was a temporary or permanent issue. Because this was like 10 days after the vaccine and he didn&#39;t really describe how much this issue affected his ability to perform usual work or task but he was a surgeon. The outcome of the events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the peripheral nerve injury is possibly related to the injection technique, not vaccine BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Upon waking up up my body aches were only moderate so I went to work. 26 hrs after vaccine, I&#39;m still having mild/moderate body aches.

Also had myalgias this all lasted approximately 2 hours but he was able to get to bed and fall asleep.  Woke up this morning feeling better but still with some chills but noticed some tenderness and redness in his right upper mid thigh.  This got progressively worse.  Continues to have chills but improving.    ED work-up including CBC unremarkable, CMP with mild hyponatremia and hypokalemia of 134 and 3.4 respectively.  ED drew blood cultures and then started vancomycin.  Vitals normal and stable in ED.  Admitted to hospital.  Provider notes on 2nd day of admission as follows.  Cellulitis and abscess of the right medial thigh likely secondary to a skin tag tear which introduced infection.  Patient currently is on broad-spectrum antibiotics in the form of doxycycline and vancomycin.  Unfortunately, the patient has been eating just ate lunch and also has been getting Lovenox.  He is not going to tolerate a bedside incision and drainage.  We will plan on proceeding to the operating room tomorrow for quick I&amp;D and cultures.  Procedures been explained.  The wound will need to be packed afterwards and ultimately healed in.  Patient seems understand plan and we will proceed accordingly

                                                &#34;Wednesday January 20th I received my second COVID vaccine, returning to work the next day. I felt some fatigue and chills through Friday, but woke up Saturday the 23rd feeling normal, except for a rash developing on my neck and the left side of my head. By Sunday, it spread, so I made a virtual appointment. Yesterday, it got worse, so I made an appointment with my primary care and saw him in the afternoon. Apparently, I was his second patient yesterday with the same diagnosis: shingles trigglered by the COVID - 19 vaccine.&#34;

As I was on the phone (to report the first one to my caregiver) when the second hit, I inadvertently punched myself rapidly and repeatedly in the right side of my head, with the phone handset functioning as an impromptu bludgeon, leaving bruises reminiscent of the victim of a fist fight.  Also at the time I had a strong headache, cold chills, a 102 degree Fahrenheit fever and body aches.  None of which persisted beyond noon.

On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

                                                Developed a cough and fatigue day after shot. Thought it was symptoms and would go away. They persisted. Went and got tested for COVID on 1/15/21 and tested positive. Took oral steroids and azythromycin antibiotics but did not help. Was hospitalized with Covid Pneumonia on 1/19/21 and received steroids and Remdesivir. Was released from the hospital on 1/27/21. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGHT THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN EMPHASIS MADE FOR PEOPLE TO GET TESTED FOR COVID BEFORE GETTING THE VACCINE.  I WAS THE 9TH PERSON AT THE HOSPITAL WITH THE SAME ISSUE.

I was perfectly healthy before the shot.. then several days after developed an ache in my right abdomen, fatigue and constant ringing in ears that will not go away.  I&#39;m also having a very hard time sleeping.. sometimes only being able to get 2 or 3 hours a night regardless of how tired I am.  I&#39;m very disappointed and not sure if I should get the second shot or not given how I&#39;m feeling now.  Before the shot I was perfectly healthy.  I eat well, exercise and have never in my life experienced tinnitus or any type of hearing problem.  This shot was the ONLY thing that could have caused this.  I&#39;m not sure what to do next or if I should get the second shot which could make it worse.  I&#39;m very worried because the ringing and aches have been constant for 10 days..  some days worse than others.

                                                Myalgia, Tachycardia, fatigue, soreness at the injection site. Narrative:  12/21 employee received vaccine at 0930 - later in the afternoon he noted tachycardia to about 100. He was watching the rate on his Apple watch. The highest rate was 130. His only other symptom was fatigue which was bad enough on 12/22 that he had to go home. He saw his PCP on 12/22 for the tachycardia who ordered labs which were all normal. He is a resident so he asked anesthesia to do an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia. On 12/23 his heart rate average went down to 100. Today (12-28) his resting heart rate is 70-80 which is his baseline. He has not had recurrence of the tachycardia since 12/23. He also reports he had soreness at the injection site and myalgias both of which have since resolved.

                                                Approximately 13 hours after receiving the vaccine I became overwhelmingly tired. Went to get ready for bed by first going into the bathroom. While getting ready I passed out (micturation syncope). Hit my head on the floor and sustained a concussion. I am still experiencing post concussive symptoms but this is to be expected as it has been less than a week.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

Pulse-oximetry applied revealed normal spO2, but tachycardia to 140bpm (this patient&#39;s resting HR is approximately 55-65).  Apple Watch data confirmed rapid increase in HR at that moment.  BP increased from normal baseline to about 150-160 SBP.  No chest pain reported.  No signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis (rash, wheezing, etc.).  HR gradually recovered to normal levels within 30 minutes and patient was released after 60 min observation.  Patient reported generalized fatigue in weeks following injection.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

                                                Patient reports receiving first dose of COVID-19 from Hospital (was not given vaccine card as their policy is to wait until after second dose).  The day after vaccination,  patient was complaining of fatigue with subjective fevers and rigors with associated headache and neck stiffness and on the day of presentation he complained of increased fatigue and general malaise for which he left work early and was ultimately found poorly responsive in his private vehicle with concern for possible seizure activity.  He was brought to ER by ambulance.  He reported numbness in hands and legs, rigidity, and an episode of urinary incontinence.  He was started on empiric antibiotics for possible CNS infection, lumbar puncture completed. Found to have acellular CSF and antibiotics were discontinued.  Patient remains in hospital at this time with course complicated by post-LP headache.

                                                47 year old Gynecologist with PMH of severe MDD, GERD, asthma, referred to the ED by his PCP, after 5 days of gait instability, and about 4 weeks of altered mental status, confusion, short term memory deficits and malaise. ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.  Completed 5 day course of high dose steroids, 6 days of IVIG and on ongoing PLEX. Neurological improvement noted 3/25

I was initially started on Valtrex thinking it maybe due to shingles but soon with the right sided facial paralysis, it was obvious it was Bell&#39;s Palsy and was started on steriods on 1/1/21 and also received acupuncture treatment on 1/2/21 which significant help improve the symptoms.  I still have some residual weakness of the right eye with some tearing and mouth weakness.

I left the hospital, start driving, and suddenly felt that my right arm was heavy, numb, with a tingling sensation. I stopped the car and called the nurse and I was told that it will go away, and I can take a tylenol/motrin. It improved over the next hour and I felt it resolved a few days later but then it returned on 1/18 but not to the same extent, and I also felt intermittent tingling and numbing in my right foot. I also experienced intermittent episodes of fast heartbeats and missing heartbeats since the vaccine almost daily. I was fatigued and extremely thirsty for 3 days but that resolved completely.

                                                I received the first dose of Pfizer EK5730 at 18:07 on 12-30-2020.  For the first day my arm was a bit sore but nothing to bad.  The next few days 48-72 hours later I started to have many more  symptoms, some minor to sever including joint pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.  lesser included some nauseas.   The joint pain was so bad at one point i had to pull over while driving.  on 1-2-21.  as of writing this now 14 days out I still have some joint pain especially in my arms.  No other symptoms of note.   I would add that I tested positive for COVID -19 on 10-18-2020 and was not released from quarantine until 11-5-20  I did seek treatment during this time through by calling my Dr. did not require any hospitalization.

                                                Some background: I normally react badly to flu/respiratory vaccines in that I generally get sicker after the vaccine than I do when I get the virus.  So this isn&#39;t entirely unexpected.   However, the timing is really strange and Now I wonder if I should get COVID tested.  Here is the chronology of events. Day of shot (Friday) - pain in arm lasted about 2 days but wasn&#39;t too intense. As the pain in the arm began to fade, I started getting really sleepy.  I slept probably 48 hours over the next three days but did not experience any pain except maybe slight muscle aches and a little of the accompanying eye burn that is associated muscle aches and sleepiness. By Tuesday, the sleepiness had passed. Thursday night (last night), I started to experience ALL general symptoms of a respiratory flu/COVID.  I developed an intense cough and associated phlem (though it is very sporadic rather than persistent) and the precursors to intense muscle pain.  I woke up at around 3am Friday with a fever, the muscle pain, burning eyes (associated with flu-muscle pain and fever), and extreme chills (though my windows was open... a normal practice as my computer makes it hot in my room).  I felt oddly rested however, as though the getting sick, while making me tired, was also helping me sleep better.  My body is definitely reacting to something.  If it wasn&#39;t 6 days afterward, I would say it was my normal reaction to virus shots.  However, the timing is alarming.  I have not knowingly been exposed to anyone with COVID.       This morning the chills are gone, the fever is down (though not entirely gone), but I still feel &#34;down for the count.&#34;  Like I said... it is my normal reaction to virus vaccine except that it is about 6 days late (usually sets in within 24 hours).  This morning is the week &#34;anniversary&#34; of the shot.

                                                The shot was administered at a vertical position rather than a horizontal position.  The physician asked me to wait 30minutes after the vaccine.  I did  experience sweats, fever and headaches.  I pre medicated myself with Benadryl 25mg an hour in a half before the injection.  My BP readings were 130/90.  I discussed with my physician i was doing a daily log on my BP. My systolic  BP reading were between the 90-100.  I was prescribed Losartan 25mg. After post 24 hours after the injection it dissipated the next day.

                                                Background, I had Covid back at the end of May/beginning of June with 1 week of constant fevers (with 500mg tylenol q6), shortness of breath, fatigue, but no real cough. O2 sats somtimes in low 90&#39;s . I am one of the radiology faculty at the hospital I work at. Received my 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Friday Dec 18 at about 21:30. After the injection, I had moderate pain at the site of injection about 6 hours later, not unexpected. However, the next evening, I was feeling fatigued and went to bed at about 7 p.m. For the next three hours, I felt chills and finally at about 10 p.m. I took my temp after I felt that my fever had &#34;broke&#34; and temp was 101.9. Used a finger pulse ox just to make sure sats were ok, they were at 97%, but unexpectedly, resting heart rate was 130 bpm. I took some tylenol and called the ER, and they suggested calling the covid hotline pager and coming in if I did not improve. I called the hotline pager, and we discussed things and eventually decided that I should go to the ER as temp remained at 101.6. By the time I reached the ER, my temp was down to 100.8, but pulse still 122 (EKG with no other abnormalities) and BP was 165/100. I had no other symptoms to account another infection. Over the next two hours, vitals became more normal with HR down to 95 to 100, and BP down to 145/85 or so without any other intervention.  Sunday, still with some mild low grade temps of 99.8, but heart rate at 85 to 90 (I&#39;m usually at about 80).   In the ER, we came to the conclusion that my body mounted a significant immune response to the production of antigens after processing the mRNA given the lack of alternative diagnosis and the improvement of sx without any other intervention besides the 500 mg of tylenol I took before coming in.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EL0142) intramuscularly at right shoulder approximately at 17:30 on 29Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity (a little over weight but he is fit). The patient had COVID in the end of Apr2020. The patient had no family medical history and had no prior vaccinations within four weeks. The patient had no concomitant medication. The second day of the vaccination, the patient called to report body aches, headache, chills, low grade temperature. As he reported, he just woke up and was walking around feeling like he had 1000 pounds on his back and felt like crap. The body aches started in his shoulder and currently all over his neck, back and whole body aches. Chills started last night (vaccination night). He was just trying to get to sleep and had to put an extra sweatshirt on last night. He did not check his temperature until he got up and it was 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit. He was not able to provide a start date for the temperature. &#34;Body aches, headache between, chills between, low grade temperature (unspecified start date), feels like crap&#34; were considered developing between 24:00-01:00. He stated that they were all medically significant and he needs a day to recover hopefully. He just felt like he was hit by a truck. The patient had not visited physician or went to ER yet. The outcome of low grade temperature was unknown, chills was resolving and all other events did not resolve at the time of reporting.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events vaccination site pain, headache, chills, and pyrexia were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. The association between the other reported events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded based on temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Those symptoms persisted for approximately 12 hours after which I continued to experience injection site pain, but began to experience pain with some numbness that radiated from the injection site distally down my arm and into my pinky and ring fingers on my left hand.  No other symptoms.  As of today the injection site pain persists as does the pain and numbness in my pinky and ring fingers, but I get the feeling that it is getting slightly worse.  The pain and slight numbness is present when I awake, but gets worse throughout the day.  Some evenings there is considerable discomfort.

Tuesday 1/19 : Very tired, no bowel movement (took imodium AD 1/18) ,legs very painful after sitting and the pain was generally from knee to hip.  Movement helped alleviate the pain.  Tired/shaky feeling increased throughout the day.  Wednesday 1/20:  Same symptoms as 1/18 AND a sensation of pins and needles  all over my body.  It would randomly come and go from literally every area of my body and this was so pronounced it was hard to fall asleep that night.  Thur 1/21.  Leg pain gone but still week and tired.  Pins and needles sensation better but not gone.   Friday 1/22 same as 1/21 Saturday 1/21 same as 1/21.  Tried to do a little work around the house and was exhausted.   Pins and needle sensation remains the same.

                                                Had fatigue, chills, aches and a headache that started 24 hours after 2nd dose.  No fever thought.  This generally subsided by 48 hours.  But then 8 days after the 2nd dose, same side effects occurred again but worse.  Was out of commission for two and a half days before feeling better.  Had bad headache and body aches I couldn&#39;t relieve with Advil or Tylenol.  Also my head broke out with a bunch of painful acne on the left side.  This is still slowly resolving, the body aches/ chills resolved after 72 hours.

A 50-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, on 16Dec2020, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. On 17Dec2020 patient got sick; 2 weeks of on and off fever and unproductive cough. In Dec2020 the patient also experienced lost sense of taste and smell. On 20Dec2020 the patient underwent COVID-19 rapid POC test and was found positive. The events required emergency room visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with Tylenol 650 every 4 hours. The events recovered on unspecified date except unproductive cough and sore throat that were recovering.   The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The association between the event lack of effect (COVID-19 rapid POC test) with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.

                                                Feverish feeling and chills with myalgias and weakness at 4am on 12/18/2020. Took 800mg advil and 1000mg tylenol. Felt perfect by 7 am. Despite this, fearing covid, I did not go to work, was rapid trsted covid negative that day and pcr tested that day retirning negative 2 days later.   Days later I began to have vague nagging chest pain with occasional sharp chest pain over my heart. I had what I would describe as chest tightness in addition in which it felt hard for me to expand my chest fully like pressure without being short of breath. This would last at most several minutes and perhaps occurred three or four times over a seven day period. Throughout this. I could exercise with no chest pain no increasing shortness of breath, including a PR on Peloton and two hours of tennis without cardiac symptoms. Yesterday, my smart internist heard a split S2 heart sound as I lay on my left side and held my breath; the EKG showed a depressed PR interval ad some ST elevstions consistent with pericarditis, which I am treating with motrin.   I assume this is a viral pericarditis. I had two types of Covid tests during that time period. My second dose of the vaccine was January 8. The feverish feeling occurred before dose 2, as did some of the chest oains  and tightness.

                                                [BioNTech COVID-19] treatment under Emergency Use Authorization(EUA):BioNTech Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccination. Two vaccinations given. Mild arm tenderness associated with 1st dose. Second dose administered 20 days after 1st dose resulted in adverse effects (AE) approximately 40-43 hours after 2nd dose was administered. AEs involved nausea, malaise, flu-like symptoms, mild fever, chills, body aches, gastritis and diarrhea. AEs lasted approximately 4-5 hours. Fatigue lingered for approx. 12 hours. Patient felt normal upon awakening next morning with no additional or lingering AEs to report since experiencing AEs from 2nd dose of BioNTech vaccine. 650mg acetaminophen was taken during 2nd dose experience with AEs. Acetaminophen did alleviate severity of symptoms slightly. Patient had loss of appetite due to AEs experienced. Patient was able to consume water without complications. No mental effects only tiredness from symptoms were experienced.

A 50-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK4176, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the left arm, on 07Jan2021, at 11:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and no known allergies . There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first vaccine of bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020, at 12:00 PM, Intramuscular, on the Right arm for Covid-19 immunization, he had numbness in his right hand x2 days. On 09Jan2021, following second dose, he has had numbness in both hands x2 days and on 10Jan2021, day 2, he ran a fever and his lighter weight facial fillers swelled and were painful (around the eyes - not my lip fillers). His eyes have a mix of Juvaderm products. It spontaneously resolved after 1 day with a subjective loss in overall volume. Density of the product used seemed to be a factor in the response. He knows this has been reported with the Moderna product, but he does not believe is has been reported with our product. It appears the response may not be product specific, but more specific to the type of vaccine. The patient has no Covid prior vaccination and not covid tested post vaccination. No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was recovered in Jan2020.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I felt some tingling in my face; that was followed by a few odd sensations, all of which are basically the same as when I have a flu shot.  Eight hours after the shot, I noticed that I was smelling smoke; my sense of smell started to do weird things an hour before (for example, smelling rotten food in the fridge), but this became clear when the smoke smell started.  Over the first 48 hours, my left arm was sore (sore to touch at 24 hours, gone at 48), and I had some mild flu symptoms (sore throat, stuffy nose, fatigue), plus some chest &#34;tightness&#34; which I have been feeling from time to time since March 2020.  The flu-like symptoms were all basically gone except the stuffy nose.  I still have a slight stuffy nose, and the strange smell issue.  I have been able to smell things fine all along, it&#39;s just overlaid with a smell that started as smoke or BBQ, and varies in strength; it&#39;s a bit like smelling dirt now.  It&#39;s always possible this is coincidental, but I wasn&#39;t exposed to smoke or anything that I think could cause my nose to go haywire.

A 51-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma, dry cough due to inhalation from fires over the years.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Contracted Covid after receiving the first vaccine was reported. The patient received the first dose of the Covid vaccine, then contracted Covid. He now had the option to receive antibodies through plasma. Since he had the vaccine, was that still an option? Or was that a no-no? He received the vaccine at work on 21Dec2020. He got sick on 22Dec2020 and he was at home. He didn&#39;t feel like eating, and can&#39;t lay down because it made it worse to cough. He didn&#39;t know what vitamins they were giving him. The patient probably should be in a hospital, but was not. The outcome of events was not recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

It is down to 99 now but I still have the fever&#34;), and laboratory test: unknown results on Dec2020 (reported as &#34;I did go for full series of stuff, checkup but that was more than 2 weeks ago&#34;). The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                I am a front line  physician and got my first dose of Pfizer vaccine on 12/21/2020.  For the first two days after the shot, I had only injection site soreness and mild headache, but nothing serious (Grade 1 effects). was able to go to work with that easily.  On the tenth day (December 31, 2020) after dose 1 of  Pfizer vaccine, I started to get severe myalgias, headache, chills, neck and back pain, mental fogging, malaise, altered taste, and fever spiking up to 101.2. I took Tylenol and tried to sleep. Woke up at 2 am with worst chills of my life, not improved my several blankets.  My initial thought was that I have gotten COVID 19 before vaccine could take effect.  I got 3  negative PCR tests done at hospital, first one on  1/2/2021  (day 3 of symptoms and day 13 after vaccine),  second one on  1/5/2021 (Day 6 of symptoms and day 16 after vaccine), and third one on 1/8/2021 (Day 9 after symptoms and day 19 after vaccine).  My  symptoms are still persisting  (today is Day 12 of  symptoms and Day 22 after vaccine), but have slightly improved in last few days. I have not been able to do any activities of daily life (Grade 3). Have been taking Tylenol 3 times a day,  bed rest, hydration.  I have been the biggest supporter of the vaccines, but now totally unsure. I have talked to several ID and Immunology colleagues and nobody can explain it. I reviewed Pfizer EUA document, and on page 41, a subset of people have been described who had COVID type symptoms but negative tests. May be I have a n atypical delayed and prolonged systemic reaction to dose 1.  I have decided not to take the Dose 2 and wait for a more traditional vaccine like Jonson and Johnson.

I couldn&#39;t keep food down until then. From Day 8 until yesterday (Day 11), I have been having intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, which is my only serious concern.  I have had a declining number of heart palpitations today, Day 12, but felt I should report these heart palpitations in case this is a sign of a serious complication. Should I avoid receiving the second dose?

                                                Began with a slight headache that eventually got worse.  Started, when treated, at a 5 of 10.  Left facility with a 7 of 10 headache.  Then I had a weird taste in my mouth (metallic like).  My tongue started to tingle and was a bit numb.  Eventually after Doctor at facility took me in, I was given benedryl 50 mg and an antacid.  After a few minutes the right side of my mouth became itchy but the tingling stopped.  The itch was not unbearable but it was getting there.  I was already having a slight difficulty breathing but that was from the morning even with inhalers.  As an instrument player  a doctor said I have super lungs so my results would be skewed due to how much air I take in.  But any loss of air, although in the safe range for others, is like breathing through a straw for me.  My blood pressure was 139/90 at the time.  My normal blood pressure is 117/70.  I went home feeling cold and just not feeling well, relatable to flu symptoms.  This is the next day after taking benedryl every 6 hours at 50mg/dose.  My breathing is slightly labored.  I feel ok but my arm hurts, I have been moving it around a lot just to get it mobile.  My chest feels like there is a slight weight on it which is weird for me.  At the moment my pulse is 81bpm and my oxygen is at around 96.  My norm is around 70bpm and oxygen at 99.    No temperature is consistent at 97.3.   I feel a little weird today.  I am stiff all over as well.  Little aches here and there but that is a norm.  Doing my stretches and exercise is not a go today.  Can&#39;t breathe as normal.

He was initially bleeding and unconscious and was brought by EMS to the hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital he had a temperature of 40 C. He was found to have 2 small left temporal hemmorhagic contusions on CT scan. He had a seizure during the hospitalization. He was initially treated for HSV encephalitis but it is not clear if that was confirmed. The hospital team may not have known of the recent vaccination. He improved during the hospitalization, but remained with a very unsteady gait. He could not return to the group home. He was transferred to a rehab facility to receive PT on 02/16/2021. He remains at rehab. Prior to the fall, on the 3rd day after vaccination, on 2/8/21 at about 10 am, the patient coughed and had a small blood on the inside of his face mask while at his day program. He was seen by his PCP and had no abnormal findings. He had a CBC, BMP and CXR and all were unremarkable.

When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight.

A 52-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1686, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 at 12:00 PM  (at the age of 52-years-old) via an unspecified route of administration at an unspecified dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination.

The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine on Monday 28Dec2020. A PCR test for COVID was done on Tuesday and a rapid test on Wednesday both of which were negative. The patient experienced some scratchy throat late Friday night on Saturday, 02Jan2021 the patient called out sick to work as a cough had started. A PCR test was done on 02Jan2021 and he received results Monday (4th) as positive. The patient continued to say that the cough had subsided, as he took Delsym.  He lost taste and smell on Monday. He reports running a fever that varies from 99-101.5. He took Tylenol and Motrin to control the fever. In addition he has experienced fatigue. It was also reported, in contradiction of the above reported chronology of events, that the onset date of events was 25Dec2020 (CONFIRMATION PENDING for onset date of events relative to vaccine administration). The patient experiences of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue resulted in a physician office visit (date not specified).  The patient underwent lab tests that includes a PCR test on 29Dec2020 which was negative, a rapid test on 30Dec2020 which was negative and a PCR test on 02Jan2021 which was positive.

The clinical outcome of COVID 19 positive test, scratchy throat, sickness, cough, loss of test and smell, fever and fatigue was reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 28Dec2020, and COVID-19 PCR test positive on 02Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 52-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3248; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration right arm on 04Feb2021 07:45 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has no allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3248; expiration date: unknown) at the vaccination age of 52-year-old via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 14Jan2021 08:45 AM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. On 04Feb2021 04:45 PM, the patient reported that he believed he experienced an ocular migraine in his left eye approximately 9 hours after getting the second shot. He took 2 acetaminophen 500 mg tablets and the symptoms cleared up in 20-30 minutes. He has never experienced this sort of sensation before so he figures it could possibly be related. He woke up with a mild headache at the start of this second day (05Feb2021), as well. The events were non-serious. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the event ophthalmic migraine was recovered on 04Feb2021 while headache was recovered on Feb2021.

                                                I contracted Covid 19 in mid October 2020 and I lost my sense of smell and taste.  It took a long time to start coming back and was at about 60% of normal when I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Four days after the shot my sense of smell and taste changed.  From that day until present almost everything I smell and taste has a &#34;chemical&#34; taste and smell.  Nothing smells normal and very few things taste good.  Animal proteins are especially bad as well as some fruits and vegetables.  Most foods make my stomach so upset that it is nearly impossible to eat.  All smells are the same, nothing smells pleasant and most smells give me a light headache.  I have lost over ten pounds since this started and I have general malaise.

History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: None, this was the first dose. No other vaccine administered on the same date. The patient had no events prior vaccination within 4 weeks. In all his life. He had vaccines that received and had no adverse event or side effect whatsoever. He had had the regular flu vaccine early November. The patient experienced feeling anxiousness in the brain, Heaviness in the head, feeling weak in Feb2021, Localized soreness and pain in Jan2021, Goosebumps tingly sensation in head, Blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat is getting higher and higher on 04Feb2021. The patient could not take Benadryl as he cannot tolerate Benadryl. With Zyterc he does not have secondary effects like he does with Benadryl. The first week after getting the vaccine he only had kind of had localized soreness and pain in the area. He later clarified it was in the area where got the injection, vaccine. He just had pain soreness in that area. Other than that he had no side effects at that time. The third week, initially stated as, about 5-7 days ago he started to have a feeling of anxiousness in the brain. He could feel anxiousness and sensation in his brain that he did not feel before. It was like he had the flu kind of thing, but he did not have a temperature. However, the feeling is in his head. It is like heaviness feeling from the flu in his head. He has been having the heaviness in the head feeling for 4-5 days. He later further clarified and initially clarified the localized pain and soreness was noticed the second day, the day after getting the vaccine. This only lasted a few days.

Also, along with that feeling at the same time his blood pressure and palpitation/heart rate/heartbeat was getting higher and higher. His regular blood pressure medications won&#39;t work anymore to bring it down. His blood pressure typically ranges in the 130/85 or less range with all the blood pressure medications he was taking. Once he started having this tingling sensation in his head he had the higher blood pressure and higher heart rate. Now his blood pressure would average being about 170/110 to 180/115.

On Tuesday, yesterday, he went to get blood work done. Blood was drawn but has no results yet. Localized pain and soreness time of onset didn&#39;t remember, stated he may have had a little pain right after getting the vaccine, but it was around 21:00 25Jan2021 he really noticed the soreness and pain. The following morning around 9 AM it woke him from his sleep and he could feel it more compared to the first day. Anxiousness in the brain around 16:00. The patient had no emergency visit.

A 53-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), solution for injection, lot number: EK5730, intramuscular in the left shoulder on 23Dec2020 12:00 at a single dose for covid-19 prophylaxis. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient&#39;s historical vaccine included Shingrix and experienced weak, tired and achy that lasted for 24 hours, he received this 6 months ago (2020). The patient experienced achy joints and fatigue, both on 24Dec2020 at 10:00 with outcome of recovering. The patient called about the Covid-19 vaccine and reported that he received it last Wednesday on 23Dec2020. He said that since then he has had achy joints and fatigue that started on Thursday 24Dec2020 that has been going on through today. He received the vaccine at the hospital where he works at. His symptoms are persisting, but stated that he does feel a little bit better today. He said that it does not seem to be getting worse. He read achy joints and tiredness were some of the reactions to be expected with the medication, and now he was thinking it was a little more long term than what it should be.

A 53-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on right deltoid on 05Jan2021 07:45 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Family history included migraine (other family members). Medical history included mild blood pressure and kidney stones, reactive airway disease. Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), potassium, allopurinol and hydrochlorothiazide/valsartan for mild blood pressure and kidney stones, fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for reactive airway disease, atorvastatin, and multivitamins. The patient previously took fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) and experienced dry mouth and lost sense of taste. The patient also previously took Tdap booster on Aug2020, Shingrix on 10Aug2020, and influenza on 12Oct2020; all for immunization; and tetanus injections for immunization and experienced localized tenderness. The patient had the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 15Dec2020 and experienced localized tenderness at injection point. The received his second dose of COVID vaccine on 05Jan2021. With the first dose he had increased localized tenderness at injection site on 15Dec2020, and he rated it mild to moderate. He would say it was 80% resolved in 24 hours. It had completely resolved in 36 hours. He would say that he has recovered completely form the localized tenderness with the first dose. Then he noted his second dose was yesterday, in the context of not having much sleep the night before. The actual injection was uncommonly eerily painless. The other folks in his department had similar experience. Maybe it was the nurse who gave the injection. Maybe it was because it was the same area and sensitivity was decreased. They had to check the Band-Aid to make sure blood was there. The administration was painless. He was relieved when the arm started getting sore to know he actually received it. He had increased arm tenderness at injection site which he rated as moderate which has now resolved. It got to moderate where lifting the arm up was sore. He definitely knew that he had been vaccinated. He got the vaccine at 7:45AM and now it is 16 to 17 hours later and he would say the pain is mild now. It did persist. The first vaccine hurt a little more. He expects this to go away. Ten hours after injection he had shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias. He had unrelenting headache over night that was moderate to severe. He said it kept him awake. It was exacerbated by lying down. Sitting up helped him. It became a migraine which is something he doesn&#39;t often experience. Migraines are pretty rare for him. He took 800mg of Advil at 6AM that helped for headache and migraine. The weight of the patient was 250 to 255 pounds. Shaking, sweats, hot and cold flashes, and augmentation of myalgias have resolved. Everything has resolved except for a little headache. In the background he literally had one or two hours of sleep. He thinks that likely precipitated a migraine was increased. Last night he slept literally an hour. He took 800mg of Advil and fell asleep. He is operating on 2 hours of sleep in 48 hours. Most of the stuff is gone except a little headache and expected fatigue. Headache Seriousness Criteria: he would say that it was relatively disabling. He would not have been able to carry on. He wouldn&#39;t have been able to operate last night. It would have interfered. It was dissimilar to others. He gets rare migraines. Everything was amplified with a migraine. He certainly felt that. It was fair to say the vaccine precipitated the migraine that was mild or severe. He doesn&#39;t want to falsely attribute these things to the vaccine. Causality Headache: precipitated by the vaccine. In the context that he had not slept the night before. He had a nasopharyngeal COVID test and it was negative. He has been in a COVID study where they are looking at combination. They developed a saliva test at (Name). There is a combination of saliva oropharyngeal and immunoglobins. He has been negative multiple times. The outcome of the events headache and fatigue was not recovered and recovered for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event headache cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

I had a dripping sweat occur at the five to fifteen minute range. There was a flushing sensation during this. After a few minutes, it all abaited. The bandaid was saturated with blood.  My arm was never sore and I had zero symptoms after the initial reaction. I believe this injection was given intravascularly.  I have not been able to find ANY information to address the effectiveness of this route if administration and I seriously fear that I am not covered.

About 10 minutes later, as I was driving home, I had an odd taste in my mouth and my right cheek started to go numb.  I arrived home and started looking for answers (Pfizer information page that lists side effects).  The sensation lasted about an hour or so, then started to subside.  By the time I went to bed, there was just a little tingle at the edge of my cheek bone. Other than being tired and a bit woozy, I feel better today.

Patient also had mild fever for the last two days and was on Tylenol, blood pressure also remained elevated moderately than the usual readings. Patient was admitted through ER for 2 days and was discharged on 1/24/21, with a diagnosis of possible TIA, Todd&#39;s paresis post seizure. Patient&#39;s CT head and MRI of brain was negative for acute stroke. Patient&#39;s left facial droop and right side facial puffiness resolved over a week but noticed to have right sided pronounced weakness with moderate swelling on right arm. Patient used to eat by himself,but now not able to do so and not able to hold cup in the right hand. Patient was again sent to ER for repeat CAT scan of head, further evaluation and management. Not sure if patient had an adverse reaction to Covid-19 vaccination, but definitely these symptoms were developed after 2 weeks of receiving Pfizer vaccination, which may be coincidental. Patient was followed up by the neurologist a week after the discharge from hospital who couldn&#39;t rule out adverse reaction of vaccination. Patient is awaiting for an EEG, carotid ultrasound and Echo as an out patient.

                                                About day nine after the first dose, I had a very quick onset of diverticulitis that hospitalized me for five days.  I had some bouts with it before but nothing that had come on so suddenly.  I have had an elevated immune system in the past and it felt like my body just went into an attack mode and previous location for diverticulitis was impacted.  It is important to note that my diet had changed to no red meat two years ago and I had no occurrences of DV and was feeling much healthier from a GI perspective.  Also, and of equal importance, is that following the second dose at about the exact time frame I got the normal post vaccine symptoms (headache, slight fever, etc.).  That nine-ten day mark is what is making me curious given my immune system.  Thanks.

The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

Was sleeping 12 plus hours a day without feeling rested in the least. No problems with sleep. Also had heaviness of chest - felt like rib cage made of iron- this dissipated by the 28-29th. No excessive cough or fever, did have dyspnea with any exertion and this continues but seems to be lessening. Was not able to work due to fatigue. Yesterday remained tired but felt noticeably different-felt lighter-and today seems promising.

Called family physician, they said they knew nothing about vaccine.  Since i wasn?t having breathing problem i just dealt with pain and took Tylenlol couple times each day.  Took second dose vaccine 1/20/21.

                                                It started abruptly, i experienced brain frog and super weak, globally with al muscles and was very fatigues and malaise. I had access to a blood pressure cup the reading was 148/92, usually my BP is 100/60. Once they took my BP,  then i went to the ER. As time went on, I got more sleepy and tired. The first ER visit they  did lab work, CBC panel which was normal, thyroid test which was normal, EKG and aniongap which were negative. They gave me no medications to take and was probably there in the ER for about 6 hours.  which was on 01-15-2021.  The second time, it was around 11:45am on 01-21-2021.  While sitting at the edge of my bed, I felt a total sadness and despair and feeling of being alone. I then went to  work  felt normal in the morning  and as i went to type some notes after a minute i felt the same symptoms happening again, my BP 140/88 and went to the ER. I was really tired and could of fallen asleep, felt oriented but took me a while to process things. I also had trouble moving my entire body. They placed an IV, gave me fluids, did an EKG again which was normal. They did a CT  scan, CTA  to my chest and neck and CT perfusion, had to inject contrast, exams were both normal. The doctor came in and told me if I was okay to drive home and I drove home.  On the third episode. 01-25-2021 it occurred around 9am,  the symptoms came back but with less intense. I lied down and rested., could feel my heart racing just like the other two episodes. This symptom lasted for about two hours and kind of lingered all day but i could still function. i felt like I had the flu, moderate malaise with  brain fog.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

Intravascular air within the IVC and bilateral iliac veins could be secondary to right femoral central lying injection. 5. Somewhat abnormal enhancement pattern of the kidneys with hypoenhancement of the medullary pyramids which may suggest hypoperfusion injury as well. 6.

                                                Starting about 26 hours after injection I had body aches especially in joints on limbs, chills, and fatigue.  This lasted about 20 hours.  I took ibuprofin and acetaminiphin alternating every 4-6 hours for the aches - this dulled the pain but did not eliminate it.  Pain went from level 6 to level 4.

The first dose of the vaccine, the pain started the second day and the injection site got swollen. But this second dose was within 2 hours of my vaccine even more and overwhelming fatigue.  - aches, chills, muscle cramps, coughing, sweating - those lasted three days; headache - ever present and felt like head was in a vice; breathing was an issue - asthma was triggered on Sunday  - I started prednisone  - informal dr consultation with a friend - on Tuesday because of the asthma and by Friday I was feeling halfway better again and by the following Sunday about 75% better. 9 days later I was back at work. It took that week back at work though to get back out of the funk and by the following weekend I was close to 90%. Pain in the shoulder lasted about two weeks - it was quite tender for that long.

A 55-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12Mar2021 00:30 (lot number: ENG6199) (at age 55 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization administered in a pharmacy or drug store. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication included tramadol taken for numbing shot for tooth, start and stop date were not reported. No other vaccines received in four weeks. The patient experienced the following with his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Shot was painful and in about 15 to 20 minutes later everything felt fine. But by the time he and his wife drove out of town, he started to get HOT with the sweats, terrible headache, dizziness and started to lose his vision. He pulled over to let his wife drive and by the time he got out of the car he could barely navigate to the passenger side. They turned around and headed for the hospital, 8 min away, at this time he couldn&#39;t see anything, he was nauseated but knew the hospital was pretty close. During this whole time his heart rate never raced just kept and even beat. His breathing was also just fine. By the time they got into the parking lot his vision was slowly getting better, so they sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes with the air conditioner on as high as it could go. His wife read through the side effects, he was experiencing many on the list. They left without going in. Onset of the events was reported as 12Mar2021 12:45 AM.

A 55 year old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, age at vaccination 55 years old. Medical history included Diabetic from 2013 (Diabetes is fairly under control. He has no super high readings. His diet is better); blood pressure (blood pressure abnormal) from 2013; ongoing overweight (obviously he is overweight) from an unknown date; and heart (disorder) from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included metformin taken for an unspecified indication; lisinopril for blood pressure (abnormal); and lovastatin for heart (disorder), start and stop dates were not reported. Patient is taking an unspecified over the counter multivitamin. There were no other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. The patient is due for the second dose on 9April2021, but he tested positive for COVID-19 on 01Apr2021 with a PCR test described as oral saliva test. Patient was negative on a rapid test on an unspecified date. Patient wanted to know if he could reschedule the shot and when is it recommended. The patient had a coworker who tested positive, he decided since his throat was scratchy that maybe he had got it, then two more employees had gotten COVID-19 so he got a rapid test that was negative. On Mar2021, he stated he stayed home because he was experiencing mild congested in his head/congested in his head, which it still actually was, and he lost sense of smell completely. He was really tired, sleeping a lot, had congestion in his ears, and he can&#39;t smell anything. Patient had no fever, and his lungs were clear (unspecified date), so he commented it was deceiving since he feels fine like he can do whatever he wants, then he gets exhausted and sleeps. He stated he can&#39;t work for a whole week. He stated he is assuming his first dose of the shot is helping with it. Patient stated he is doing well, he has it (COVID-19), but he feels pretty good. Outcome of congested in his head was not recovered, while unknown for the other events.

The patient medical history included non-smoker. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient was scheduled to take the second dose on 05Jan2021, also reported as 08Jan2021. The patient experienced sore arm for 24 hours afterwards on Dec2020. Patient experienced mild COVID symptoms such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, and tiny bit of shortness of breath on 24Dec2020, but stated he was better now. The patient was positive in the COVID test on 28Dec2020. He wanted to know if it was normal to get COVID after getting the vaccine and if he should get the booster shot if he gets better.  He commented that testing positive for COVID was medically concerning. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow ECMO) or receive a mechanical ventilation. Treatment included over the counter medication. No additional testing was done. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the event sore arm was unknown; cough was not recovered; fever, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, tiny bit of shortness of breath was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number was already obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 virus test positive cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A contactable nurse and contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ XR), orally from 02Oct2020 at 11 mg, daily for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 19Dec2020, the patient experienced neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare.  In Dec2020, the patient experienced increase in joint pain from his baseline. The physician was aware. The patient was placed on unspecified steroids for the events, neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare which minimized symptoms. While weaning off steroids, the severity of symptoms returned. The patient was instructed by the doctor to stop taking tofacitinib citrate which was stopped on 29Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for tofacitinib citrate was permanently withdrawn on 29Dec2020.  The patient reported slight improvement after stopping tofacitinib citrate.  The outcome of neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare was recovering and of increase in joint pain from his baseline was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, the reported events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors and unlikely that it is related to the suspect product. However due to temporal association with the vaccine, a possible contributory role of vaccine cannot be ruled out. Case will be reevaluated based on additional information during the follow-up.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

                                                I did not experience any adverse symptoms with the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine with the exception of injection site pain after the first dose that began on day 2 through day 5 or for 3 days.  The first Pfizer-BioNTech dose was received on December 30, 2020, LOT EK5730. I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS on 12/31/20.  Please note that I completed the same pretreatment protocol 1.5 hours prior to dosing with Pfizer-BioNTech of Diphenhydramine 25 mg plus Pepcid 20 mg for both COVID-19 doses.  I elected to complete a self-administered pretreatment protocol due to a shellfish allergy and literature reports of anaphylaxis with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in food allergy recipients.  I did not experience any adverse symptoms on Saturday afternoon after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at 4:45pm on 1/23/21.  On Sunday morning 1/24/21, I awoke feeling &#34;cold.&#34;  I dressed warmly, but the feeling progressed to chills by 3pm.  Malaise ensued around 1pm.  I also experienced injection site pain on the morning of 1/24/21 beginning at 7am.  The pain lasted until 1/25/21.  I would rate the pain as a 5 out of 10 on VAS ON 1/24/21.   I began to feel uncomfortable with malaise and chills at 6:15pm on 1/24/21 and self-administered one dose of OTC Aleve, Naproxen sodium 220mg plus one dose of Benadryl 25 mg.  I began to feel better by 9pm on 1/24/21.  I awoke on 1/25/21 without any symptoms or discomfort with the exception of some injection site pain (2 out of 10 on VAS).  I have been asymptomatic since 1/26/21.

I then became goofy. Started laughing etc. Then in the drive home about 20 minutes later I started to be tired. I was in the phone with a friend and slipped into a deep slumber. The next day Saturday I woke groggy like from a hang over minus the headache. I had a sudden urge to eat , i bacon and egg sandwich with mayo then had a urgency to eat a bowl of cereal. (rice crispies. Then tried to work (remotely from home) but I could not concentrate or focus. Finally I just threw in the towel and went back to sleep. Woke up to send this report.  Good night. I still recommend this inoculation to everyone!

For the Uveitis I went to my eye doctor and started a prednisolone regimen and am still on it. I received the 2nd does (lot EL9264) yesterday on 3 Feb at 09:00am. The mouth ulcers were treated with oral medication-Valtrex. 2nd dose does not seem to have aggravated the above noted reactions. Other symptoms common to the injection are occurring but seem more intense after the 2nd dose (aches, low energy, some minor coughing)

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer reported that her 56 years-old male son (patient) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation on 24Mar2021. Relevant history and concomitant drugs were unknown. The reporter stated that her 56 year old son received his first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine a day earlier than she received hers (which was on 25Mar2021) and while waiting after getting his vaccination, her son became &#34;very, very dizzy.&#34; He told the nurse working at the vaccination site that the dizziness was getting worse and &#34;getting very bad.&#34; He was asked how his breathing was and he told the nurse it was okay, but an ambulance was called for him anyways and he was sent to the hospital. Her son reported feeling better when he laid down but still reported feeling dizzy. At the hospital, her son was told that all the test came back okay. When her son got up to use the restroom with the assistance of the doctor, the doctor told him that he was dehydrated and gave him IV fluids. Caller stated that her son reported feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; after the IV fluids but &#34;couldn&#39;t hardly walk&#34; and had to have someone else drive him. Her son reported feeling &#34;alright&#34; the next day. Caller stated that she was reading in the information pamphlet on the Pfizer vaccine that a severe reaction could include dizziness. Caller was worried about her son getting his second dose and think she should speak with his physician before receiving his next dose, and would like to know if this was okay. She was concerned because she states that she had heard that people have gotten sick from the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was resolving. Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I developed severe back pain from an old injury. The back pain was far more painful this time and I had a 25 minute long shivering attack (rigors?). I was admitted to Piedmont for observation (I had an intermittent fever) and tested for everything. All results; MRI, CT, Echocardiogram, showed normal for my age. The pain is better and improving but it?s still been significantly longer lasting than any previous time. My PCP suggested I post this info to the CDC website but I wanted to let you know in case you were compiling any info related to symptoms/side effects.

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

                                                One week after the vaccine the arm was very red and looked infected. He went to the doctor and was given Amoxicillin. But two days later he was feeling so ill he was in bed all day and had a horrible headache. He went back to the doctor 3-26. The doctor cut his arm open, drained it, flushed it and gave him an antibiotic shot in the rear end. He also prescribed Doxycycline and Linezolid because he believes its a MRSA infection. He did swab it but we don&#39;t have the results back yet. The wound is not as red today and my husband is feeling better. Should he get the second vaccine? the doctor said this was the second patient he saw that day with the same infection at the vaccine site. I received my vaccine the same time and had zero issues. The doctor thought maybe his arm was not sufficiently alcohol swabbed but I know he was swabbed as was I as we were in the same room. He has severe asthma so we wanted the protection from the Covid vaccine but want to know if it is safe to get the second vaccine? I have taken photos each day so I can share what his arm has looked like

A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

I was already not feeling my best that morning symptoms of warmness at home no fever , I checked. No issues with vaccine given approximately 0715, until 1005 am after a very busy morning with nothing but coffee to drink. As I sat down to assist in order entry in our chemo clinic I suddenly became aware of a very rapid heart rate. I realized that I was having a vaso-vagal response and started perspiring lightly and realizing I was having drop in blood pressure. I composed myself removed my mask and breathed slowly and drank cold water while sitting. After a few minutes I was able to slow my heart rate and felt secure enough to leave the pharmacy. I slowly walked and controlled my breathing and continued to drink water. I was able to return to work and continued until the end of the day. I felt somewhat fatigued until bedtime that evening. Slept reasonably well that night and had no other symptoms to my memory the following day.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Most problematic has been the re-emergence of a long dormant auto-immune disorder (12&#43; yrs), bullous pemphigus. This disorder, when active, causes blistering and sloughing skin in soft tissue areas. It can be very painful and uncomfortable. It usually emerges when I have a significant event that causes my immune system to plummet. I fully believe this vaccine precipitated this occurrence.

Note that  I had similar reactions to the flu vaccine&#39;s for 17 straight years , with the exception of the brain fog. Flu shot reactions stopped when I started taking Amway  Double X multivitamins and tripling up on Vitamin A, C, Zinc and echinacea 3 days before through after the vaccine.  Shot 1 - initial  side effects: 40 minutes after shot within a mile of returning to work from hospital, I suddenly got lightheaded and very tired with brain fog creeping in. Since that was closer than home, I continued  on to work hoping it would soon pass.  Brain fog,  dizziness and fatigue all  continued to worsen, and I was taken home. Effects lasted 9 hours. 3-4 days later the symptoms all came back and lasted 2-3  days, with the addition of temperatures in mid to high 96 range. My normal temperature is a degree low at 97.8.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number not provided, expiry date May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Jan2021 10:00 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and apixaban (ELIQUIS, lot number ABA8272S, NDC 0003089421, expiry date Oct2021) film-coated tablet, via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to 31Jan2021 at 5 mg, twice daily for cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis. Medical history included: he had tested positive asymptomatically for COVID due to contact contamination on 02Jan2021 or 03Jan2021, blood pressure, and A-fib (atrial fibrillation). Concomitant medication included ongoing metoprolol for blood pressure. There were no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient stated that he got sick after getting the vaccine (on 30Jan2021) and had an important question. He got a fever (31Jan2021) and all that stuff that lasted like a day and a half after getting the vaccine, just like a million other people. But he missed the part about asking a doctor about taking his blood thinner, which he took as normal up through the day that he got the vaccine and the next morning, then he stopped it. The patient clarified that he got the vaccine on Saturday (30Jan2021), stopped the blood thinner on Sunday (31Jan2021), the sickness subsided around Monday (as reported), but he still hasn&#39;t gone back on the blood thinner. He wanted to know when it was safe for him to start taking the blood thinner again, and he needed to know what to do for the second vaccine. The clinical course was as follows: He got the first dose of the vaccine on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 and at 22:00 he started feeling hot through the night. On Sunday, 31Jan2021, he had 103 degree fever, chills, body aches, and a headache. He clarified that he recovered completely by Wednesday, 03Feb2021. He had been on Eliquis for years for A-Fib. He stopped taking it once he got sick after getting the vaccine and went back and read the material and noticed what it said about the blood thinner. He did not go to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office. The action taken in response to the events for apixaban was temporarily withdrawn. The outcome of the events was recovered on 03Feb2021.  Follow-up (05Feb2021): This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer based on information received by Pfizer from Bristol-Myers Squibb (manufacturer control number US-BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY-BMS-2021-013684), license party for apixaban (ELIQUIS).  This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: #) on 05Feb2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 09Feb2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a patient and describes the occurrence of PYREXIA (103 degree fever), CHILLS, PAIN (bodyaches) and HEADACHE in 58-year-old male patient who received apixaban (Eliquis) film-coated tablet (batch no. ABA8272S) for Cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis. CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included Covid-19 Vaccine injection for COVID-19 immunisation. Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure abnormal. On an unknown date, the patient started Eliquis (batch no. ABA8272S) (unknown route), 5 milligram twice a day. On 30Jan2021, the patient started Covid-19 Vaccine (unknown route) Unknown dose by injection in left arm. On 31Jan2021, an unknown time after starting Eliquis, the patient experienced PYREXIA (103 degree fever), CHILLS, PAIN (bodyaches) and HEADACHE. Eliquis (Unknown) was interrupted due to event. On 03Feb2021, PYREXIA, CHILLS, PAIN and HEADACHE resolved. DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 31Jan2021, Body temperature: 103 degree. For Eliquis (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 58-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: ER8734) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 04Apr2021 12:00 at age of 58-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It also stated the patient was one of the most vulnerable against virus so he took the Covid-19 Vaccine. Medical history included ongoing cardiac failure congestive diagnosed probably 10 years ago, ongoing diabetes mellitus diagnosed probably 20 years ago, ongoing dialysis for 3.5 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing unspecified blood thinner. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t take any blood pressure medications and that she knew the patient took a blood thinner. Caller unable to provide further detail for the patient&#39;s medications as she doesn&#39;t have the patient&#39;s list of medications with her. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EP7534) injected in left arm in Mar2021 at age of 58-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fatigue after the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that it was hard to determine the cause of the fatigue because the patient was on dialysis, but that the patient has been more fatigued since he received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was a compromised fellow with a host of pre-existing conditions as far as heart disease, diabetes, and dialysis. Caller was calling in regard to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she was calling to report a bad reaction that her husband, the patient, received on Sunday, 04Apr2021, following his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Approximately 3 hours after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine, the patient had a full blown seizure at 15:00 on Sunday, 04Apr2021. Caller reported that she had to call emergency responders following the patient&#39;s seizure. The patient was doing better but the experience with his seizure was quite traumatic. Caller stated that if it was going to happen, it was going to happen to us. About 3 hours after receiving his Covid-19 vaccine on 04Apr2021, the patient became real sluggish and his speech started getting slow before the seizure occurred. Caller reported that the patient made a gradual descent downwards. Caller reported that she swears the patient has not been the same as far as fatigue goes since the patient received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior. Caller reported that she thought the fatigue was maybe from dialysis. The patient started to get slow just before the seizure, about 2.5 hours after he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The patient was laying down following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s breathing was off. The patient&#39;s breath was heavier. Caller reported that after she noticed the patient&#39;s breathing was off, she asked the patient if he was ok. Caller reported that this is when she noticed that the patient&#39;s speech was really slow and that he was experiencing confusion. The patient has had no more seizure activity. The patient was still being monitored in the hospital. Caller reported that the patient didn&#39;t remember any of it. It&#39;s hard to say if the patient&#39;s sluggishness and fatigue were ongoing. Caller reported that she couldn&#39;t go see the patient while he was in the hospital but that the patient&#39;s voice sounds much stronger. For Confusion and Speech: Caller reported that the patient seems to be back/ returned to normal. Caller reported that she knew that the patient&#39;s cardiologist went to see the patient. The patient&#39;s cardiologist said that there was nothing that happened to the patient&#39;s heart, that what the patient experienced was not a heart issue, and that the event had no effect on the patient&#39;s heart. The medical staff stated that the seizure the patient experienced was related to a blood pressure drop. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s blood pressure was very low on 04Apr2021. The patient required a visit to Emergency Room for event seizure, no visit of physician office. Admitted on Sunday, 04Apr2021 for seizure, and still hospitalized. For investigations: Caller reported that the medical staff at the hospital definitely did lab work but she was not sure if any imaging was performed. Caller reported that she has no results available for tests that were performed. The outcome of events confusion and &#34;speech started to get slow&#34; was recovered in Apr2021, the outcome of other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed.

He also had irritation in his throat on 08Apr2021. So, he went to the doctor and the emergency room and he is taking medication and he has been taken the medication for approximately 4-5 days now. Medication worked during the day but by the next morning the rash and itching start all over that. Body rash: Caller reported that the body rash started in the patient&#39;s torso and under the patient&#39;s arms.  Caller reported that the rash spread up the patient&#39;s neck. Caller reported that the patient had a red, itchy rash (04Apr2021) and there were some hives involved. Caller reported that the patient went to his doctor on 05Apr2021 in terrible, miserable shape. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s physician prescribed prednisone. Caller reported that the patient took the prednisone later in the day on 05Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient went to work on 06Apr2021 and felt a little bit better but during the night of Tuesday, 06Apr2021, the rash began to spread again and the patient began to get the hives. Caller reported that the patient went to work on 07Apr2021, after taking a dose of prednisone. Caller reported that the patient called her around 8:00 PM on the evening of 07Apr2021 and stated it&#39;s starting all over again and it&#39;s spreading. Caller stated that the patient reported that he had hives on his neck, his shoulders, his body, his private parts, and his butt.  Hands swollen (07Apr2021): Caller reported that the patient&#39;s right hand was swelling and had swollen to at least 1 or 2 sizes bigger than normal. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s left hand was swelling some. Caller reported that the patient had difficulty squeezing both hands into fists due to the swelling. Caller reported that the patient went to the emergency room during the night of 07Apr2021. Caller reported that the emergency room provider prescribed a stronger dose of prednisone and administered prednisone to the patient in the emergency room. Caller reported that the patient did not go to work on 15Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient took a dose of the new, stronger prednisone and the prednisone seemed to settle the rash down a little bit. Caller reported that around 3:00 AM 07Apr2021 into Friday, 08Apr2021, the rash started all over again. Caller reported that the patient already had an appointment scheduled with his physician for 08Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s physician referred him to an allergist and the allergist prescribed Fexofenadine HCl 180 mg and Famotidine 40 mg. Caller reported that so far, the fexofenadine and famotidine seem to be working. It was also reported that patient had Burning sensation in esophagus on 08Apr2021. Caller reported that the concern of her and the patient is that the patient is scheduled to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine this Friday, 16Apr2021. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist is recommending that he wait another 2 weeks to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she and the patient are going to go to the appointment on 16Apr2021 and request for the appointment to be rescheduled for 2 weeks later. Caller reported that she is very concerned if the patient should be getting a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine or not. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist informed the patient that the patient could get Covid-19 and die from that, but that the patient won&#39;t die from the allergic reaction he is experiencing. Caller reported that she questions the allergist&#39;s opinion because of the misery that the patient has been in. Caller stated that she just needs some answers. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist had stated that there was one other person that he was aware of that had a reaction 10 days after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that it was odd that the rash had started 10 days in, and reported that the patient ruled out food and ruled out any changes as the patient hadn&#39;t changed soap or laundry detergent recently. Details were not provided for the other patient the allergist reported had a delayed reaction 10 days after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s allergist thinks the Covid-19 vaccine caused the patient&#39;s reaction. Caller reported that she and the patient are scared about whether he should get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and are unsure of what she and the patient should do at this point. Caller stated that she knows that people don&#39;t like to give advice, but that they say if you have immediate adverse reaction you shouldn&#39;t get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller stated that the patient&#39;s reaction wasn&#39;t immediate, and asked if it the rash should still be considered an adverse reaction and the patient should not go get second the second dose, or should the patient go with what his doctor said as it is recommended that you should listen to physician. Body rash: Caller reported that the patient&#39;s rash has dissipated for the most part. Caller reported that the patient still has some redness in parts, but the itching has subsided at least as of this morning, 12Apr2021, when she spoke to the patient around 6:00 AM. Hands swollen: Caller reported that the swelling the the patient&#39;s hands went down in the emergency room on Wednesday, 07Apr2021, night and began to dissipate on Thursday, 08Apr2021, with 50 mg of prednisone. Caller reported that she believes the patient&#39;s hands have returned to normal at this point, reporting that the patient is at work and as a mechanic, the patient has to work with hands. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s primary care physician did take blood work, but the patient&#39;s allergist said that the results of the bloodwork would probably not be relevant based on fact that the patient was on medication at the point that the labs were drawn. Caller reported that she believed the initial prescription for prednisone was 10 mg tablets. Caller reported that the patient had to take 4 tablets the first day, 3 tablets the second day, 2 tablets the third day, and 1 tablet after that. Caller reported that she and the patient are concerned about the patient getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that she and the patient are trying to anticipate what would happen after the patient received the second dose. Caller stated that she would like to know if someone would recommend or say it&#39;s ok for the patient to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and if the patient has a reaction, that it won&#39;t be as life threatening as getting Covid-19. Prednisone did not help rash, hives, or itching (10 mg tablets, dispensed in pharmacy bottle).

                                                Had my 2nd COVID vaccination shot at 2 pm on Monday, January 11, 2021.    Next morning - moderate pain in upper left arm/shoulder (place of injection). Working full shift.    Around 4 pm on Tuesday (after almost 3hrs OR case) - feeling very tired. Completed the working shift at 6 pm. Minor to moderate headache started to develop later in the evening. Two pills of Tylenol at 9 pm, another two around 2 am - while headache was getting worse.  @6:30 am Wednesday - informed managers that I&#39;ll have to stay off work because of bad headache (7 to 8 from 10), called EH as well.    During the day - mostly staying in the bed. Tylenol, water, tea with lemon, apples for hydration. Headache -- up and down (between 4 and 8), occasional fatigue and nausea (after staying upright more than 10-15 minutes), left upper arm pain, moderate pain in joints (knees, hips, low back). No fever.   Troubled night-time sleeping because of headache. 7 am - informed managers and EH about my condition, Got approval for another day off - with request to have a C-Test after that. Similar feeling and treatment.    Slow improvement during the day. Around 5 pm - feeling good enough to start moving more actively, headache and shoulder pain on low level, though getting tired quickly still.    Much better sleeping. No symptoms in the morning. Had a COVID test before returning to work.

A 59-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140), intramuscular in left arm on 12Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included migraine, rosacea and overweight (not obese) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included doxycycline, magnesium, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIM) and Vitamin D. The patient was 59 years old when vaccinated with first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL0140), intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 11:00 at single for COVID-19 immunization and experienced a sore arm at the injection site. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was in the nursing home/senior living facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. For the first 24 hours, the patient simply had a sore arm at the injection site on 13Jan2021 09:00, similar to what he had with the first vaccination. Then for the next 12 hours had chills, subjective fever, fatigue, and headache on 13Jan2021 that did not respond simply to ibuprofen. The outcome of the events was recovered on unspecified date. The patient took ibuprofen, triptan as treatment for the events. The events were considered non serious as it did not result in death, were not life threatening, did not cause/prolonged hospitalization, were not disabling/Incapacitating and were not a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

A 59-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, lot number: EM6208), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15Mar2021 11:00 (received at 59-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient just got his second Pfizer shot Monday 12Apr2021 10:45 am (lot number: EW0162) administered in Arm Right, and he got his first one on 15Mar2021. He wants to report what he thinks is a side effect. He does not know if it is related or not, but at the end of Mar2021/ beginning of Apr2021, he started having excess mucous. He has fits where he is trying to cough up mucous for 45 minutes. Ever since it started there has been a lot of mucous. He has been taking Benadryl and stuff like that. He headed to urgent care on 11Apr2021 but decided to go to the ER (emergency room) instead because he was having a mucous coughing spell. They checked for pneumonia, but it was negative. The chests x-ray was clear with no pneumonia. They are saying it is allergies, but he has never had a reaction like this with mucous.  He has been wearing his mask too. He knows the allergy season is supposed to be bad, but they said on the news the masks were actually helping with the allergies. That people were having less symptoms. They were contributing it to allergies, but he has never had them this way before. He wants to report because he is thinking maybe it was something from having the vaccine. He thinks the mucous first started the end of Mar2021 or the first day of Apr2021. He went to ER on 11Apr2021. He also went back and forth with the doctor. They gave him allergy medicine. The ER gave him codeine cough syrup and Allegra D. His GP has him on Sudafed now, Flonase, Allegra, and Benadryl. He has fits at night nothing seems to change. He is not sleeping because he is constantly choking and coughing every second. Last night, 13Apr2021, he finally fell asleep at 3 am and woke up at 9am. They do not want to give him prednisone yet. He would have to wait 2 weeks after his last shot for it. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.
