                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

Low pulse ox (88) Fever (101-102F) and chills Related difficulty urinating and frequent urination due to prostate inflammation Loss of memory (Brain Fog?) in which I had no memory of events occurring from 3/7-3/9 and little memory on 3/10.  Memory was close to normal on 3/12.   Two Covid tests with negative results (taken on 3/8 and 3/11) Some lung congestion which could be due to bloody sinus mucus and post nasal drip I did retain my sense of smell and taste but had no appetite and did not eat or ate very minimally  from 3/7pm until 3/11pm Very fatigued and weak with knee, hip and general joint pain.  Increasing levels of fatigue started on 3/2 with little energy from 3/7-3/11.  Fatigue is mostly gone as of 3/23.

A 61 year old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) at the age of 60 years old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Mar2021 (Lot Number: EL6205) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, mouth started to feel numb and allergies to tree pollen; and family history of diabetic and heart disease (father); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included losartan potassium (TEMISARTAN), gabapentin, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), furosemide, potassium, valproate semisodium (DIVALPROEX) and tizanidine; all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2. The next day, he said his mouth started to feel numb, and he had a loss of taste. Then on Saturday, his eyes started to tear a lot, and the right side of his face started drooping like that of a stroke. He also said he had headache on the back of his head, and his eyes do not. The patient wanted to know if he should go to the emergency room or if this is a normal reaction to the vaccine. The patient did have a sensation starting on Thursday of numbness in his mouth. The patient describes it as a feeling like when he was younger and would use chloraseptic spray, it feels like same numbness. He states that on Saturday his eyes started tearing up, and he does have allergies to tree pollen. The right side of his face feels and looks like he had a stroke, it is droopy on right side. The patient can&#39;t pronounce words right, can&#39;t smile, and can&#39;t close his right eye. The patient was checked with heart rate and EKG with his little machine and his temperature, and they all seem fine. The patient was also getting headaches at the back of his head. The patient took Advil for headaches, but it is not improving. The patient ran out of the Advil and doesn&#39;t have the bottle anymore. The patient took allergy pills, a knock off Benadryl, because he thought his eye tearing was possibly from allergies to tree pollen allergy or possible allergic reaction to the drug. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fine, CAT: not reported, EKG: fine, complete blood work: not reported and heart rate: fine; all on 15Mar2021. The outcome of loss of taste was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Not as sharp or quick with mental processing and decisioning making. Work from home, so it&#39;s really obvious when I am off my game. Drank 6 x water at 12 oz per. Took two ExStrength Tylenol about 130, no fever, knocked down achey joints, head began to clear, but still not sharp. Not sharp mentally continued into morning of 31 March.

                                                Initially headache, and sore arm at injection site. Only sore on contact and not too bad. Fatigue and loss of muscle strength (I am a hard core cyclist), not detectable during normal activities. A week later it persists. On the fourth evening, I could not stay asleep. As soon as I would drop off I would dream. It would be a violent encounter. I would physically strike out and I would wake up.

Observed that my uvula was swollen, but not so much as to interfere with breathing. Symptoms improved over course of the day. General malaise all day, and into following day. I called my primary care doctor, their office said the symptoms were not serious and didn?t require any professional attention.

The next day arm was sore, perhaps sooner. Also, the next day I was lethargic/sleepy, had a slight chill and was sore in at least some joints, including ankles. No treatments other than staying in bed. The second day I was close to back to full energy.   Now a month later I&#39;m occasionally naps these days, which I wonder whether are prompted by the vaccination.

                                                Originally went to ER, they diagnosed it as torticollis.  They sent me to my PCP who confirmed it.  I had violent &amp; severe neck pain and severe headaches. Also an extremely stiff neck where I couldn?t turn it 1/8th oh an inch to either side.  It all got so severe that I didn?t eat for days at a time and was literally not with it.  Couldn?t respond when spoken to, and became excessively weak where I couldn?t walk w/o help, and speech was slurred.  It all lasted 5 days where it was so severe.  With medication it slowly began to back off.

Since then has been found to have gram-negative rod bacteremia, although urinalysis was negative, urine culture pending. Patient has since defervesced after receiving 1 dose of cefepime. Overall the most likely cause of fever seems to be urosepsis w/ bacteremia, pending confirmation with urine &amp; blood cultures.

Then starting on the 3rd day until present, I feel extremely light-headed and unsteady with a persistent severe headache.  Almost feels like there is pressure in my head for lack of a better description. I feel feverish as well but do not have a fever.  I have difficulty maintaining balance on my feet so it is difficult to walk.   I did seek medical attention yet since I live alone and do not feel comfortable to drive. Although the symptoms are difficult, I also don&#39;t consider them an emergency to warrant calling an ambulance.

Went home and still felt dizzy and then I felt like I need to pee  but I was very cold ,  urinated 3 more times thinking it was because it was due to being cold but doctor explained it was due to me drinking lost of water.  Went to bathroom and bassed out and woke up about an hour later, but during the fall I injured the neck by heating your head on the sink, back and broke my nose, when I woke up  I was still very dizzy. Also felt a fast heart rate,  chest pain, very nauseas and started sweating a lot.

                                                This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 61-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Blood pressure high, Cancer (Two or less years ago; In remission, Taking medication to follow through with remission period), Allergies and sinus issues, covid virus (in July). The patient reported soreness in the arm (15Jan2021), fatigue (15Jan2021) and  palpitations (16Jan2021) that he felt below the mouth and above the heart, calling it the esophagus area. He wanted to know if others had reported this same palpitation. The reporter further reported that he has a little bit of concern. He felt fine, had sore arm and fatigue that has gone away. Noticed lately, somewhere in his esophagus between his heart and mouth that he is feeling palpitations. Doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s more indigestion. Stated it could be gas. Sometimes comes and goes, feels different than what he&#39;s already experienced. Wanted to double check if this has been heard of or anything similar to it. Clarified product as first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine. Received last Thursday. Received COVID-19 Vaccine in left arm on 14Jan2021 between 15:00 and 16:00. Both arms are sore, but only because other arm is injured. Pain level in injection arm was around 5-6 and he wasn&#39;t able to sleep on that side. Within the second day, 16Jan2021 in late afternoon soreness and fatigue was gone. Indigestion or Palpitations, feeling was happening again. They wanted to know if that is something he is experiencing from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Stated it doesn&#39;t appear to be related. It is around the esophagus. Stated it affects breathing. Stated maybe that has something to do with it. For the dose, they noticed it was a small amount of fluid in the tube that was injected into him. The outcome of the events soreness in the arm/sore arm and fatigue was recovered on 16Jan2021, while for other events was unknown. Information on the batch number/lot number has been requested.

                                                I have been have contact with my primary care doctor because of the reaction with the first dose. He advised me to take Benadryl 15 minutes before receiving the injection.  I stayed at the vaccination site for an hour instead of 15 minutes. I left the vaccination site and went home and went to sleep, I worked over night. I did not sleep well that day. I got up around 6pm and I went to work at 10pm and I was extremely anxious and tired all night. I was a little confused while at work. I got off work and went to my chiropractor who noticed and my wife also noticed that I was extremely pale, after the appointment I went home and went back to bed. When I woke up I was still exhausted that I ended up calling out out of work that night.  I went back to bed and slept all night till 9am this morning. The next morning my color was back and I was looking better. My energy level is slowing  improving but still feel tired even when I got a good nights of sleep. I don&#39;t know if it related, but I went and brought some new shoes and then my hip started hurting. It is to the point where I set up a doctor&#39;s appointment on Monday to have my hip looked at.   See VAERS report 906796 for first dose reaction.

Approximately 48 hours later, he developed left-sided lip paralysis.  He went to his doctor that day, no medications were prescribed and no tests were ordered.  Over the next 24 hours, he states that his symptoms progressively worsened and now the left side of his face seems &#34;completely paralyzed.&#34;  He described left ear pain, increased sensitivity to loud sounds, runny nose, and inability to close his left eye.  He saw another doctor the next day, who diagnosed Bell&#39;s Palsy and prescribed valacyclovir for 7 days. Patient also noticed a transient &#34;crooked smile&#34; after his first dose of Pfizer vaccine, but did not relate this

A 61-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL9621), intramuscular on the left arm on 22Jan2021 (reported as 07:45 to 08:00) at a SINGLE DOSE for prevent COVID, at 61 years old. Medical history included triple bypass surgery from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime. Symptoms (unspecified which) reported as recurring and are notably worse at bedtime. Patient is hesitant to receive the second dose. The patient stated he just went to sleep and prayed and then when he woke the next day, at night it did it again. At night it comes and goes, and he still has it happen but not like the first time. He tried to describe that he was washing his hands and he almost passed out like on an unspecified date in Jan2021, he was going to lose his mind. Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown. Outcome of the events dizziness, &#34;feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his brain wanted to pop out of his head/ his brain wanted to swell up&#34;, felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy, and fever was reported as recovering.

                                                After the vaccine he came home, felt a little less sore than a flu shot.  The next day when he took a shower, and when he went to wash under his armpit was very swollen, and very tender.   He put some ice on it which did not help the swelling.  It bothers him when his T-shirt touches the area, so he tried to wear a regular shirt.  He also had achy pain in his back, weakness in his arms, sore throat and a little cough, no fever.  The armpit still hurts and is still swollen.  Other than the ice he did not take anything else as he takes a lot of medications as it is.  He has not called his doctor because it happened over the weekend, but is going to call her today.   He did have a COVID test yesterday drive through facility at the community hospital as he has a surgery coming up, and they were going to call him if it was positive.  He is scheduled for surgery on his right knee on Thursday.

History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

I was taken to an examination room at the vaccination clinic by their nurse director. Blood pressure was high and there was a question if I was having a stroke or heart incident. the director sent me by ambulance to Hospital as they didn&#39;t know if I was having an anaphylactic shock or cardiac incident. All this occurred within an hour if the first symptoms.

The exact date of the vaccine is unknown. His girlfriend told me he got his second Vaccine at the end of February. I also don&#39;t know what vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer) he got, so the Pfizer is just a guess. Patient started feeling bad and looking bad after his second vaccine. He complained that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and missed appointments saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the two weeks or so between the time of his second vaccine and his death.

Last for the duration of the stress, a few seconds.  Left eustachian tube slightly sore, slight earache.  Has gone on for almost a week now.   Best guess is nerve is pressured or damaged?  Will try hydroxide in ear next, in hope it kills whatever&#39;s going on.  Whether this will go away or not is unknown at present.

I believed it to be vaccine side effects and continued normal daily exercise routine, which is quite rigorous in some instances.  Exercise seemed to alleviate problem temporarily.  I never considered angina or heart issues as a  problem since I&#39;ve had great exam stats, including low cholesterol, low triglycerids, normal EKG, not overweight, never smoke, exercise regularly, maintain healthy diet.  Day of second dose, chest pain and headaches increased significantly.  EKG performed by PCP and Emergency Room confirmed abnormal.  Diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, emergency angiosplasty performed on right coronary artery.  I felt this all to coincidental given timing and duration of side effect with 1st and 2nd shot.  All EKGs in past, including one in August 2020, normal, and then abnormal six months later.

The next day my sinuses became burning and I assumed it was hayfever because I had experienced some symptoms of that for the previous two weeks. But the next day, Tues., it was worst, like a bad cold (which all of this &#34;reaction&#34; may have been), but then the next 3 days I could barely get out of bed--and that&#39;s unusual because I run every day and nothing stops me. I had bad headaches for 5 days or so and that included coughing, from a dry cough at first to a very wet cough and very large thick segments of gelled mucous coming out of my sinuses, something I&#39;ve never seen before. After almost two weeks I felt much better but was still coughing, and now three weeks later I&#39;m still really tired, can&#39;t think as tightly as usual.

A 62-year-old male patient received NT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL01-40), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Dec2020 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Anatomical Location provided as Left deltoid. Medical history provided as none. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). Physician stated, he got his Pfizer vaccine on last Sunday on 20Dec2020 around 9:30 there was usual soreness at the site of injection on 20Dec2020, which was there but no problem. But Monday (21Dec2020) after his vaccine that was Sunday he had and Monday night on 21Dec2020 he had chills he thought these were all just the reaction to the vaccine. Next day on 22Dec2020 he went into work he had mild body ache at work, at about 3:30 he felt a little sick and he got his temperature about 100.2, get home rested, next day on 23Dec2020 he worked from home, did not go so for next four days (from 24Dec2020 to 27Dec2020) he rested at home but his chills and body ache are not going away. They were there, they come and go, he took Tylenol, it went he have mild sore throat, cough on Dec2020. Today on 27Dec2020, the patient just took the temperature 100.7. For Causality assessment: Physician stated, &#34;he didn&#39;t know, he was just trying to find out to get to bottom of it. Is it really COVID infection or is it due to side effects as from what he read the reaction shouldn&#39;t really last long. It may last probably 3-4 days but this has gone beyond that so he was little concerned and the fever that he had was 7 days after the vaccine.&#34; The patient still had chills and body ache which he means they were not going away and now mild fever. When probed for the outcome of, Physician stated, &#34;They are persistent you know some day he had one day which was good but after that in the afternoon in the evening he felt the same thing. Fortunately, he was off for four days it didn&#39;t really have much problem, physically it was persistent has not gone away.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, had mild body ache, felt a little sick, cough, fever, mild sore throat. The outcome of events chills, mild body ache was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                Blood pressure was high; tired from the night before; Itchy; slight headache; little lightheaded; Heart racing; panic attack; Hot flashes; Sweating; Chills; achy/body aches; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. A contactable consumer reported for himself, a 62-year-old male patient who received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (reported as by injection) to left arm on 14Jan2021 at 3pm at single dose to prevent COVID/COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety. Concomitant medications included antidepressants. The patient received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine last 14Jan2021 at 3pm, and everything went well. When he left the place, he had a slight headache. He had to stay there for 15-20 minutes to make sure he had no reaction. He just got a little lightheaded, he didn&#39;t think much, and it didn&#39;t get worse. The patient took 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL) and forgot about it. It went away for a while. He took the shot at 3 pm and he took paracetamol at 4 pm. Later that night, about 10 pm, everything kicked in. He was sick again at 10:30 pm, or so, the headache was gone for several hours. He was ok between 4 pm and 10 pm. Then about 10 to 10:30 pm, when he went to go to sleep, his heart started racing, like he was having a panic attack, then he started getting hot flashes, sweating, chills, and aching, and this went all night from like 10 pm to 11 to the next morning. He had a doctor&#39;s appointment to get his knee examined for an upcoming knee surgery. The patient clarified that he didn&#39;t go to the doctor because of the symptoms, he went for his knee. He asked the doctor, before getting examined, and the doctor said he got off easy, as the doctor himself was sick for 3 days. The patient asked the doctor if he could take something to calm down, as his blood pressure was high on 15Jan2021 at 8 am. They had taken his blood pressure to examine his knee, and the doctor said it was alright. He was prescribed with alprazolam (XANAX), and the doctor said it would be fine. The next day, he was tired from the night before. He had no symptoms the next day. After he took alprazolam, he slept fine, he felt better. The hot flashes, heart racing, body aches, and chills were gone, and he read everything as far as symptoms. The heart racing went away about 11 the next morning because he took alprazolam. The patient stated that he forgot to add one more, he had all the symptoms described as side effects, but he also had itching. He had very mild itching and was given cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC, lot number: OHE2723, expiry date: Feb2022, UPC: 4122053077), it was like 80% gone. Every now and again he has a little itch, but it was bothering him all night that first night. Currently, the patient felt pretty good. He has no symptoms other than the slight itch. He further stated that his second dose is on 04Feb2021. Out of all symptoms, the thing that freaked him out the most was the heart racing, he asked if he could take diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) before the shot. He has been on antidepressants for a while, he has a lot of anxiety, but the day he went in, he felt good, and didn&#39;t take alprazolam. He also asked if this have triggered all that heart racing stuff. He was seeking for information if there was anything to do to prepare him better, he knew you have to sit there for 15-20 minutes to see if there was a reaction. The outcome of the event headache and lightheadedness was recovered on 14Jan2021, unknown for blood pressure high and tiredness, recovering for itchy, and recovered on 15Jan2021 at 11 am for all other events.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 25Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing urinary incontinence (use of medication that does not make him run to the bathroom and helps him hold his urine), ongoing acne, drowsy, and ongoing flow of urine or weak bladder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included fesoterodine fumarate (TOVIAZ; Expiration Date: 04Dec2021) (about 2 weeks prior to getting the COVID-19 vaccine) for urinary incontinence, doxycycline (Expiration Date: 26Nov2021; makes him drowsy) for acne, and tamsulosin (Expiration Date: 12Nov2021) for flow of urine or weak bladder; all from Jan2021 and ongoing. The patient does not take any of these medications while driving. The patient took his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 25Jan2021 (Monday). The patient had been experiencing dizziness which started a few days after getting the vaccine (Jan2021). The patient was supposed to work from Tuesday to Friday, but he did not go into work on Wednesday. The patient was unsure of the specific day the dizziness started. The patient did have allergies (unspecified date), but when he called in his doctor, he sent him a medication for allergies, meclizine (Expiration Date: 28Jan2022). Normally, the medication takes a couple days to make him feel better. After he took meclizine for dizziness, he feels better. The patient notices the dizziness when he is up and moving around. The patient can tell something is off, like his equilibrium is off in Jan2021. It may not be due to the shot, but looking at the paper it says tiredness, which he has been feeling fatigued (also started a few days after the vaccine, but he is unsure specifically what day) and dizziness, which he has in Jan2021. The medication he is taking (meclizine), can also do the same thing, but never for this long. When he takes it, it normally makes him feel better after a few days. The patient has sinus problems as well on an unspecified date, but never lasting this long. The patient had not started feeling better since taking the medication, meclizine (as reported). The patient also said that meclizine could be causing the fatigue because it does make his drowsy and he just sleeps when he takes it - he cannot take it when he drives. The patient would go back for the second dose on 15Feb2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Dizziness when he is up and moving around&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Allergies&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

He went to urgent care and he was tested for covid and the test came back negative. He then kept feeling bad. He clarified that on 24Jan2021, he had headache and nausea. He had chills and he was beated down with sweat; body aches which are constant and he  would try to blame it on the position he was laying in while on the couch and it was not that; and does not have an appetite on an unspecified day in Jan2021. He has been in really bad shape for the last 9 or 10 days. When he went to go get his second shot, they would not give it to him due to his symptoms that he was experiencing since she had a fever at 100.4 the night before (28Jan2021). They scheduled him to get his second dose the following which was this Friday. He was asking if his side effects are totally normal. He cannot even sleep, reported that he will sleep an hour and then up for two or three hours. It really has him, and he feels miserable. The outcome of events Chills, nausea and fever at 100.4 was not recovered. Outcome of sniffles was recovered in Jan 2021 while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of sniffles; he went to urgent care and they gave him something like zyrtec, states it was an allergy medication and it wiped out the sniffles for fever, he will take Tylenol and it will break the fever for a few hours and then his fever comes right back.  Follow-up attempts are completed. The information on the batch/lot number has been obtained.

                                                Within 1 minute of vaccine being injected. I started to feel dizzy. I was wheeled in wheelchair to observation area. I kept feeling more dizzy and started to feel tingly in my fingers and legs (both sides equally) After 15 minute observation time was over, I tried to stand up and immediately sat down again as a wave of dizziness  hit me. Doctor in observation area saw me and came over. I told him how I felt. He put his fingers to my wrist and felt my pulse. It was initially between 40 and 90, then steadied off around 90-100. He called for EMTs on duty to come over with a stretcher because he thought I should be laid flat. The EMT took my blood pressure and it was 155/94. The doctor said at one point my pulse was thready. By this point the dizziness was stronger and I felt tingly in my teeth as well as other areas. I was asked about my breathing and I said that it was okay. An ambulance was called for and arrived. I don&#39;t remember the exact time. The moved me from the wheelchair to a stretcher. I could not stand up on my own and lurched toward the stretcher. I am grateful strong people were there to get me on stretcher and strapped in. All throughout this my normally barely noticeable Atrial Fibrillation was quite apparent and more erratic. This was a major reason for ambulance call. Some of the stroke protocol was done including gripping EMT&#39;s fingers equally and following his finger with my eyes. I was very cold throughout. I was brought to the waiting ambulance outside and driven to Medical Center. The EMT took an EKG which showed atrial fibrillation and a line was put into my arm.  When we got to the hospital, I was brought into the triage area and had all my vitals taken. Blood pressure was high, so was pulse then for a half hour, I was very hot and sweated a lot after being cold.

                                                I&#39;ve been running a fever for almost 4 weeks now.  I have to continually take Advil.    My liver enzymes are high.  Tiredness and fatigue.  At times I have an upset stomach.  I have been checked for Covid 3 times and each time is negative.  I went to the emergency room on March 15.  I was given fluids and an antibiotic through the IV.  I have been to the Dr. multiple times.  They have checked me from head to toe and are puzzled.   This all started the day after I got the first shot.

Later that night I noticed a decided lack of energy and some arm soreness at the shot site when I touched it. The chills and fever subsided after about two to three hours, but the rest of the symptoms continued until I fell asleep around midnight, which was about 12 hours after getting the shot. The aches, arm soreness and weakness all lasted for about a week afterwards, with the weakness being the last thing to go.

He stated he felt fine, he was just tired a little early and went to bed at 10. He woke up at midnight with a headache and a delirious fever. He didn&#39;t test his temperature or anything but it was high enough to where he got delirious, but he doesn&#39;t know how high that was.  He took Tylenol 2500mg capsules which helped with the headache and not the fever, so 4 hours later, he took Ibuprofen  800 mg which seemed to helped with the fever. He stated the headache is gone. Caller stated delirious feverish was gone but then clarifies he doesn&#39;t know if he has recovered completely actually, it feels like he has, but these things are funny sometimes. Caller reported muscle aches started around midnight on 26Mar2021, and were gone by 27Mar2021. Further Caller reported he had swollen joints- his hands, knuckles. He adds his arms and shoulders, but he doesn&#39;t know if that was from laying on them all night for as long as he did because he slept all the next day, too. The swollen joints seems to be resolved at this point. He clarifies all the symptoms started around midnight on 26Mar2021, about 12 hours after the shot. He confirms that he did not have swollen lymph nodes.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Question of whether vaccination caused worsening of lung function / sarcoidosis.  Still currently hospitalized.  Transferred to our organization for ECMO.    Hospital Course: Patient is 62y.o. male with PMH of Sarcoidosis who presented to the hospital with worsening shortness of breath. Over the past 2 weeks, patient has had worsening shortness of breath on exertion and also while talking. On 4/23, patient noted intermittent fever, TMax 102F. Patient was seen by his PCP on 4/25 and started on a zpack, and was also seen in our ED on 4/25. He was discharged home with OP pulm follow up. Since then, patient has been feeling progressively worse, He noted 4/27, that his pulse ox was in the 70s with ambulation and that the cough and shortness of breath were worsening.    In ER, patient has been placed on 6 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. He was also febrile with TMax of 101.5 F. POC COVID-19 testing was negative. WBC was slightly elevated at 10.7, Na level was noted to be 129. PCT was negative. CTA PE protocol was negative for PE, there was significant interval progression of nodular and consolidative opacities throughout both lungs when compared to 2017, compatible with interval progression of sarcoidosis. Patient was admitted for further workup and management.   Patient&#39;s oxygen requirements gradually increased. He was initially treated with IV antibiotics and antifungals. He underwent extensive testing, including urine histoplasma, cryptococcal, respiratory viral panel which will negative. TB QuantiFERON was indeterminate, along with elevated IgM mycoplasma for which he received azithromycin. Patient was also placed on IV Solu-Medrol initially, transitioned to IV Decadron. Inflammatory markers were elevated. D-dimer was noted to be greater than 10,000, he was placed on therapeutic Lovenox dosing. Patient did have Covid testing which was negative, he was also vaccinated. His oxygen requirements continue to increase, he was eventually placed on BiPAP, although due to lethargy and increased work of breathing patient was eventually intubated and sedated. He was also started on paralytics. Patient was transferred to another hospital for possible need of ECMO or lung transplantation.

A 63-years-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 21Dec2020 14:40, at a single dose for Covid 19. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient has no prior vaccinations -within 4 weeks. The patient is an EEG technician. On 22Dec2020, the patient reported the next day he started to feel sluggish, chills, tired/fatigue, pain all over his body, patient mentioned he has lost weight everyday since he got the shot from 153 pounds to 142 pounds; then on Wednesday evening 23Dec2020, it was a nightmare, he got sweating; fever with a high of 101.4 Fahrenheit; he was running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; and he was so tired and fatigued. Added when he was getting up all that night he was having night sweats up to five times a night and chills; and his heart was pounding. The urination, heart pounding resolved the next day. All of these events have improved at the time of report (now) or gone away but he is still sweating once at night for the last two days and he is tired and fatigued. He stated that he is scheduled for the second dose on 11Jan2021 and he is concerned if he should take the vaccine. He mentioned that he was tested for COVID 19 on 18Dec2020 and the result was inconclusive. He went again 23Dec2020 they called him on 25Dec2020 and informed he was positive per the PCR test. He treated himself with 500mg acetaminophen (UPC 0904672059; lot OBE2896 and expiration Oct2021) and azithromycin Z-Pack (NDC 65862-641-69; Lot ZYSA20012-A; and expiration date Mar2022). The sample of the product is not available to be returned. Predisposing factor was that the patient&#39;s wife was at home and was sick too at the same time. She was tested Sunday with no results yet. The outcome of the events of fever recovered on 28Dec2020, sluggishness recovered on 29Dec2020, pain all over the body was recovered on 02Jan2021; running to the bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine and heart pounding were recovered on 24Dec2020, weight loss was not recovered, and for other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (4 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between event &#34;COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / SARS-CoV-2 test positive) and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded

A 63-year-old male patient received the 1st does of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose left upper arm on 23Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history included ongoing hypertension that began maybe 10 years before and still ongoing, controlled with medication. No family medical history relevant to the events. The concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL). History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the suspect. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. He has not had reactions to any other vaccines. On 30Dec2020 he tested positive for Covid. His symptoms of covid started 27Dec2020 in the evening sometime probably around 7pm. He experienced cough in Dec2020. No visit to physician office was required. On the 06Jan2021 he went to the emergency room but that was because he was concerned about rash he developed. He thought it was due to the Tylenol he was taking. Relevant tests performed in Ja2021 included: blood work and chest X-ray did when he went in for the rash and they were was fine. He was treated with steroid injection for the rash. The rash cleared up in the next couple days. As of 12Jan2021 the only thing he has cough but he coughs anyway. He still had a cough but it was not atypical for him to have a cough. He was scheduled to receive his second dose on 13Jan2021. He no longer had any Covid symptoms and wanted to know if he could still get the second dose as scheduled. The outcome of event tested positive for the virus and not recovered was unknown, of coughs was not recovered. A Product Complaint was filed.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

A 63-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose on the left arm for vaccination. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism. Concomitant medication include levothyroxine (manufacturer unknown) from an unspecified date probably 2-3 years ago and ongoing for hypothyroidism. The patient reported that the first dose was administered of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 04Jan2021. He had onset of soreness in left arm that day, 14Jan2021 which he recovered completely from by 05Jan2021. He stated that starting maybe 05Jan2021 or 06Jan2021, he had onset of feeling kind of achy and like he was wanting to run a fever. Starting 08Jan2021, he started running a very high fever in excess of 102 degrees Fahrenheit which has been ongoing and persistent since then. He has been taking Tylenol every 6 hours to try to control the high fever but the high fever is just not going away. He was wondering if there is anything he can do because his primary care physician (PCP) can&#39;t really help him at the clinic; He was wondering if Pfizer is familiar with this reaction and if there are any recommendations regarding them. He has taken Tylenol to help, but it is not making it go away. He wanted to know if steroids could be used to counteract this side effect. He added that he is supposed to get the second dose 25Jan2021 but he does not plan to get the second dose, at this point he does not want to do that.

A 63-year-old male patient (also the age at vaccination) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EK4176, expiry date: Not available/provided by the reporter at the time of report), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm from 21Jan2021 10:00 AM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient is vaccinated in a hospital. Medical history included bilateral iliac aneurysms on an unspecified and inferior wall MI in 2004. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. The patient had no known allergies. No covid prior vaccination and not covid tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication included (reported as other medications in two weeks): aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID]), simvastatin, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL), alfuzosin, colecalciferol (D3), zinc gluconate (ZINC (GLUCONATE).  It was reported that at home, approximately 45 minutes after shot (reported start time: 10:45 AM), lips started tingling, then itching. Around 10 minutes later (10:55 AM; 55 minutes), throat began feeling irritated/scratchy. Approximately 10 minutes (11:05 AM; 65 minutes) later lower lip became swollen. The patient took half a Benadryl. Never had any difficulty breathing or swallowing. The presentation never got any worse. Tingling of lips lasted most of day, but milder than initial reaction - other symptoms gone in approximately an hour after taking the Benadryl (reported also as: No treatment was received for the events; pending clarification). The outcome of the event lips started tingling was recovered on 21Jan2021; and for all other events was recovered on an unspecified date.

Started around 6 AM by 9 AM couldn&#39;t stand  very weak  slightly lightheaded    Threw up till almost choking.  At noon my temp hit  103.7   Took tylenol all AM and wasn&#39;t lowering temp.  That was the highest temp  Then gradually began to  come down   At 5:00 PM temp at 100 and able to put soup down.  Woke up  4 AM next day in  total sweat that had to move to other side of bed  Soaked but felt OK   On 23rd  Got headache above right eye to side of frontal lobe,   Not any strong headache at all   Dull  Like a 2 out of 10.  My concern is I still have the exact same headache as I did three weeks ago  Not a smidgen lower at all  SAME.  And I booked second vaccine for Sat 2/27th    I am concerned as I have heard second can be worse.   I have never had the flu and this was my first ever vaccine of any kind    Please advise

                                                One week to the day after my second shot, overnight I came down with a sore throat which turned into chest congestion, coughing, sinus discharge (green) tightness of my chest. This came on extremely fast. I had to take 2 days off work. I saw my family physician, who sent me for chest X-rays. Came back negative for COVID, but showed signs of Bronchitis. I have been subject to sinus infections, but have not had any issues in over 5 years. I have never had issues with Bronchitis. My Family doctor prescribed Prednisone  &amp; Levaquin. One round did not take of the issue. I received a second round of both. It has not cleared up my coughing/congestion. I still have a sinus discharge (green) infection to date.

                                                I started to develop a headache and became a little nauseous right after. After two days, my fingers started swelling and hurting. I couldn&#39;t make a fist. It caused my immune system to go crazy. That lasted about 5 days. After taking Aleve and Tylenol, it helped reduce the pain. My kidney doctor told me to stop taking Aleve because it was interacting with my BP meds. The doctor from Northwest Arthritis prescribed Tramadol to help with pain. I still have pain, but it&#39;s tolerable.

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/ lot number: EL9269, Expiration date: Unknown, NDC number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder area on 08Feb2021 16:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing asthma for about 60 years, ongoing high blood pressure for about 3 years and was on blood pressure medication, issues with thyroid for about 3 years and was on thyroid medication (ongoing). Concomitant medication included ongoing thyroid medication. Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. Family medical history relevant to adverse events was none. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Adverse events following prior vaccinations was none. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect was none. The patient experienced bad prostate, bladder infection, sore arm on an unspecified date in Feb2021. On 11Feb2021, the patient experienced body aches, feeling worse, shivers, headache, mild fever. It was reported that, caller received his first dose of bnt162b2 on Monday 08Feb2021. He&#39;s reporting adverse events and would like to know: If he takes Tylenol to treat his symptoms, would it decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine or not. Also, if he were to go for a COVID-19 viral test, would the fact that he was received the vaccine interact with the test and cause a false positive result or not. Patient was reporting that yesterday, day 4, he started with body aches, headache, and &#34;when he got in bed, he had chills and shivers real bad, little chilly&#34; so possibly a mild fever. Enquired could these all be side effects of the vaccine or not. If he go for the COVID test - would it be positive or not. He also states he has a history of asthma and has been hypervigilant about avoiding COVID infections. Caller, reporting on the COVID vaccine and who explains that he got the first shot on Monday and he had a mildly sore arm- this lasted 2-3 days, no big deal. Then 5 days later he had really bad body aches and a headache. He went to bed cause he was feeling worse but before going to bed he noticed he had shivers really bad, uncontrollably almost which lasted over an hour. He presume they are fairly normal side effects but wants to confirm this could happen after five days. Also, he was told not to take Aspirin or Tylenol before getting the vaccine because it could affect the efficacy, but he wants to know could he take a Tylenol now 5 days later for the headache and body aches. He was better now than he was doing. Caller clarified the event was 4 days after the shot, the shot was Monday and events started Thursday.

                                                I was engaged in moderate physical activity for about 2 hours when I suddenly became very weak. I stopped working and took a shower. Within an hour I started having severe cramping around my chest and torso that last about 24 hours. Since the second day, I haven?t been able to  be active without starting to sweat and suddenly feeling weak and having to sit down. Even repotting a plant this morning started symptoms in minutes. I also have been experiencing dehydration since the day of the injection.

                                                I fully understand that this is outside the side effect window.  However, on Sunday, March 14 I started to experience a fever (100.4), fairly significant fatigue,, tireness, loss of appetite and a slight headache.  The reason I am writing is that in addition to getting the vaccine, at which time I was triple-masked, I only left my home one other time to drop off mail at a post office (again, triple masked).  Neither myself nor my wife (the only other person I live with) left the house (other than she left once to pick up our grocery order, outside).  On Sunday, after the symptoms started, I went to a local clinic and took a PCR Covid test.  The results came back negative six hours later.  The symptoms lessened on Monday (the fever ranging from 99.4-100.4----my usual body temp is 97.6) and by Monday night the fever was gone.  By Tuesday morning not only was the fever gone, but so also were all the symptoms.  Again, I know this is outside the usual timeframe for side effects, other than maybe a skin rash, but I wanted to let you know because I think it is unlikely I contracted another virus because I go virtually nowhere, and am tripled masked whenever I go anywhere.

A 63-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), (Batch/Lot Number: EN6203), intramuscular, administered in left arm on 26Feb2021 at 10:15, at a single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included early stage prostate cancer more than 2 years ago; surgery only, no meds. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient hasn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 02Mar2021 at 8:00, the patient experienced classic kidney stones symptoms, with no prior history and on no medications. All other symptoms were more typically reported for the vaccine (ie. headache, fatigue, etc). Patient has pending doctor appointment. The outcome of events was unknown.    No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

I had to hold onto furniture as I made my way across the room.  After this continued for several hours, I did some research on the web and was led to believe that being dizzy was a serious event.  At 7:11 PM, I got a ride to the hospital and checked into the emergency room.  I was there at the hospital for about 30 minutes and noticed that the dizzy feeling was gone.  I walked out of the hospital without every going back to an examination room.  I caught a ride home at 8:08 PM.  Note that the only other adverse event was a sore arm and a vague feeling of not being well.

These symptoms progressively worsened over the course of several days. On day 6 after receiving the vaccine, the patient stated his right leg started dragging and he had a difficult time functioning. The patient drove himself to the ER where he collapsed. A bleed in the brain was subsequently discovered and the patient underwent surgery, where he spent 3 days in the ICU. The patient was later discharged. As of today, the patient states he has resumed normal function

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications. On 30Jan2021, when he woke up in the morning, he felt like had a weigh on his entire body and got up and he just instantly started having chills, and fever usual (statement incomplete). He looked at all the symptoms of getting the vaccine and he had like 98 percent of them that was just normal, just like a flu. But he was travelling tomorrow morning at 5am and he don&#39;t want to travel right now. He still have a fever on and off. He doesn&#39;t know if it was safe enough to go on a plane after getting my first dose and how long the symptoms will last. The patient felt like he got run over. His wife got her second dose a couple of days ago and had really bad reactions like flu and could not move all day and that was a Moderna one. Patient stated that he was 6 ft; however, not appropriately paraphrased and clarified. The patient received unspecified treatment for the events. The patient considered a causality between the event because of the vaccine. Outcome of event fever was not recovered; outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch number is requested.

                                                Around 330 on 4/6, I started feeling bad and arrived home around 530pm and  had a slight Temperature (99) with hearing loss in both ears. But the right one had complete hearing loss. Thinking it would be a short term side effect, but realizing on Thursday am with was not, I called my physician office on Thursday and they called back on Thursday for a Friday 9am appt with the PA. She said it was sinus related , fluid in the ears was pushing the ear drum back and gave me a prescription for Fluticasone and to take my Zyretx and Sudafed. Call her in a week if symptoms did not away. On 4/12/21, I still have massive hearing loss and pain, so called a ENT for an appt and received a 1:15pm on the same day. This  was the first day I had balance issues.

A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Mar2021 14:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.

About 30-45 minutes after got out of there, he was sick, didn&#39;t know what was wrong with him. Also reported as by 16:30 he felt bad and pulled up to a friends house.

His heart rate was going between 80 and 200. He had 3 different IV&#39;s going in each arm shooting different heart medications in him and the doctor explained that the medications didn&#39;t mix well, could not go in the same IV at the same time. The patient shared that this was the second worst feeling he has ever had since he had his first heart surgery. He meant they thought he was dead or dying he lost feeling of everything. His arm felt better, but every now and again felt like a little knot or something was in there. He was breathing better, they gave him inhalers, albuterol. He thought that his heart doctor was going to start him on oxygen. He went to his Cardiologist on 01Mar2021 on Monday, 2 weeks before getting his first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine: cardiologist told him his triglycerides raised up about 15 was about 268.

A 63-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 03Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732) as SINGLE DOSE (at the age of 63 years) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (diagnosed for a decade), ongoing hypertension (diagnosed for a decade), ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus (5-6 years ago diagnosed, very well maintained type 2 diabetes), ongoing pneumonia (He has been hospitalized 4 different times for pneumonia. In Dec2020 when he had pneumonia, they did not hospitalize him. He has had pneumonia 5 time since 1982. Concomitant medication included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. &#34;He gets the flu shot every, and he has had the shingles shot. He also gets the pneumonia vaccine every 2 years.&#34; The patient experienced pneumonia (hospitalization) on an unspecified date with outcome of not recovered, itchy, on 08Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, dry cough on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered and non-productive cough on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: unknown results on Oct2020.  On 13Apr2021 He reported it to the doctor and he told the patient to skip a dose of Lisinopril that sometimes it can have those symptoms of a deep nonproductive cough. He skipped the medication, and it hasn&#39;t gotten better. He thinks it is from the COVID vaccine.  At the peak of his cough, he probably had 6 days where he coughed uncontrollably for 24 hours in a day.  He still has a cough.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pneumonia. The doctor didn&#39;t do a chest X-ray or COVID test.

They did a blood test, a sonogram or some kind of sonogram, and a urine sample. They also flushed the patient&#39;s bladder out with a catheter. This emergency room visit determined that it might be a urinary tract infection (UTI) and started him on antibiotics. The patient confirmed he was not admitted to the hospital. The patient then made an appointment with his doctor because that was on a weekend. He saw his doctor who referred him to a urologist. The patient also reported that he did have the normal arm pain and fatigue the second day or the day after the shot. The patient reported 11Mar2021 or 12Mar2021 was when he started bleeding after the first shot, he was unsure of the exact date, and stated he went to the hospital on 14Mar2021.

By 10:30pm, I began having flu like symptoms, (aches, low grade fever, sinus symptoms) took another acetaminophen 1 GM.  At 11:00 pm, developed severe rigors that lasted for approximately 2 hours. I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

                                                64-year-old male who presented to the clinic with complaints of left-sided weakness on his face. He stated when he woke up this morning he noticed that the left side of his mouth drooped and that he could not close his left eye all the way. Yesterday he felt fine. Today he went to work. Patient stated that on 12/18 he got the COVID vaccine. It was on a Friday. The following day he had a headache and he felt flu-like. He stated that those symptoms resolved quickly. He then had the facial weakness today (11 days after the vacciantion). He has not had any fever, sweats, or chills. Patient stated that he had called ask a nurse, and he was advised to hang up and call 911 and go to the emergency room. However, he stated he was an EMT and did not feel that was necessary. He denies headache. He has not had any vision change. He has been eating and drinking well without any difficulty.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General appearance - patient was not in any distress. He was conversant, pleasant and appropriate. HEENT - normal conjunctivae and lids. Sclerae anicteric. Pupils equal and reactive to light. Patient was not able to close his left eyelid. Normal ear canals. TMs are pearly gray with bright light reflex. Neck - supple. No lymphadenopathy. Skin - pink, warm and dry. Neuro - alert and oriented. Deep tendon reflexes 2&#43; upper and lower extremities with no focal weakness. Normal range of motion. Patient can raise his right eyebrow. Could not raise his left eyebrow. There was impaired eyelid closure on the left; tight closure on the right. Smiling of the face revealed lateralization to the right side. When frowning, he had upper and lower facial paralysis on the left with flattening of the forehead. The patient could not tighten the left side of his mouth.   ASSESSMENT: Bell&#39;s palsy.   PLAN: Discussed pathophysiology of Bell&#39;s palsy. Advised patient I recommended him to call the number that he got with the information when he received his COVID vaccine. Advised patient that I could not definitively correlate the Bell&#39;s palsy with the COVID immunization, but that he can call the number he has to let them know of his symptoms. Discussed treatment options. Since patient woke up with his symptoms this morning, I advised patient that he would have hopefully the best outcome because he would be able to get on the steroid and antiviral soon after developing the symptoms. He is to wear an eye patch to prevent corneal drying or abrasion of the left eye at night. Using Lacri-Lube at night before placing the eye patch and then following up by using artificial tears during the day.   Patient was placed on prednisone 60 mg once a day for 1 week to be taken with food. Valtrex 1,000 mg 3 times a day for 1 week.   Side effects of medication discussed. Handouts were provided. He will follow up with PCP if any changes or concerns. Advised patient that it may take up to 3 weeks before all his symptoms have resolved

The second dose he received it at 8:45 AM on Sunday (10Jan2021) and Sunday night he began experiencing tiredness and then chills, fever, generalized aches and could hardly sleep through the night. It was reported as the worst night in his life and then, fortunately during the day on Monday, gradually, the intensity and severity of the symptoms began to subside but he was not able to do any of his normal functions. Then last night Monday night (11Jan2021) he slept well and today on Tuesday (12Jan2021) he was okay, this morning everything was fine. On Tuesday night he took Acetaminophen for pain, he clarified that was Sunday night after he had gotten the vaccine he took Acetaminophen and he still had the problems then Monday night he thought it would be the same so he put the medicine next to the bed on the night stand but he did not need to take it. He slept and woke up this morning and his back to work. Now it is like nothing has happened. He has recovered completely from all effects.

He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before. He said he had chicken pox as a young adult, and he only had 1 spot of chicken pox. He had never had dry eyes before. Reporter seriousness for fever, UTI, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness, rash, shingles were medically significant. For other events were unspecified. The outcome of event injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness was recovered on 31Jan2021, dry eye, tiredness was not recovered, while the outcomes of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known possible local reaction, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of injection site pain, redness, and puffiness cannot be excluded.

                                                I had no adverse effects at the time of the vaccination and the day was uneventful but I got a small headache early in the evening on the left side of my head/neck.  I ignored it.  By bedtime 10/11 PM Thursday night I had pain in my neck on the right side that felt like I had been in a bad car accident.  By 4 O&#39;clock in he morning the pain was almost unbearable.  I got up and did an hour of stretching and it became bearable.  I had finally taken a  8 MG HYDROMORPHONE tablet just before 4 AM that the doctor had given me last summer for falling over a pile of lumber and landing on my back on a 4 x 4 board.  That helped some.    Ever since then, the pain in my neck has gone from a 4/10 to a 9/10 in pain and the headaches have clustered on the left side of my head.  The worst ones are just below my left ear.   It is now Saturday night and the neck pain is not as bad but it is not gone either,  It still hurts to turn my head, cough or when I get up or down.  I did not do anything physically to cause this.

He states he is taking his ProAIr inhaler every hour and it helps for the hour, but after that his breathing gets worse. Patient states he gets SOB with lying down and walking. Patient was speaking in full sentences and states it was because he just took his inhaler medication. Patient states he is positive for chills onset Sunday. Patient did have his first dose of COVID vaccine on Thursday. Denies difficulty breathing on Thursday, and per patient could have started Saturday night. DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition:   1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation (HCC)  Patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on p.r.n. albuterol at home as well as nightly Spiriva, coming to the emergency department for evaluation of worsening shortness of breath over the last 3 days with associated tightness with his breathing.  On arrival to the emergency department, patient is sitting forward, tachypneic, prolonged expiratory phase with diffuse expiratory wheezing.  He is saturating low 90s on room air.  He is placed on 2 L nasal cannula for comfort.  He received 2 DuoNeb treatments with EMS as well as Solu-Medrol.  I am going to treated with a continuous nebulizer treatment and obtained laboratory workup as well as chest x-ray.  Vital sign show tachycardia which is likely from his albuterol treatment, he is mildly tachypneic, otherwise stable.   Patient&#39;s laboratory workup is reassuring, troponin is negative.  Chest x-ray does not show any consolidation.  Patient does have some improvement in his symptoms after his continuous nebulizer treatment.  His VBG is repeated after treatment and shows that his pCO2 is going down however he is still slightly acidotic with the pH of 7.28.  Patient reports that he still tight in his chest, improved however uncomfortable going home.  He is still significantly wheezing on my exam, given this I did discuss this case with emergency department observation who agreed to accept for admission.  COVID testing is negative.  Patient is admitted in stable condition. Pulmonary:     Comments: Patient is sitting forward in the stretcher, he is tachypneic, prolonged expiratory phase with expiratory wheezing in all lung fields.

                                                No treatment.  I had a cardiac ablation in the fall because of chronic atrial fibrillation. It appeared to have worked. One day after receiving the vaccination I took a walk with some hills and had what I believe was a mild episode of atrial fibrillation. I verified as best I could, using a pulse oximeter.  I feel fine for the most part, but a little bit tired and dizzy. I do not plan to call the doctor unless things get worse.

I took generic Tylenol again, and went to bed early.  It has now been a week and no other side effects have been noticed.

A 64-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), first dose (at the age of 64-years old) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm (reported as injection in left shoulder) on 11Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 1982 and ongoing, ongoing seizure (he had seizures for about 6 years and they got worse,  probably it has been 6 or 7 years he has had seizures), high blood pressure, heartburn and insomnia (comes and goes). Concomitant medication included atorvastatin (manufacturer unknown, Tablet) 40mg strength,  oral administration, 20 mg daily (half a tablet at bedtime) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; cholecalciferol (manufacturer unknown, Tablets) oral administration, 2 tablets in morning taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; escitalopram (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg once daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; lacosamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 200 mg twice daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for approximately a couple of years) and ongoing; lisinopril (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg daily taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; mesalazine (MESALAMINE, Tablet), oral administration, 4 tablets a day  taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; omeprazole (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 20 mg as needed (two or three pills daily as he feels like he needs) taken for heartburn and ulcerative colitis from 2001 (approximately 20 years ago) and ongoing and zonisamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 100 mg twice a day taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for a couple of years) and ongoing.

He could hardly carry the groceries to the car. He also had wobbliness. On 11Mar2021, the patient fell down and passed out coming home that night and he had blood all over him. He later clarified that he did not pass out, he got into the house and fell down and somehow landed on the recliner. He was covered in blood and all kinds of stuff. On 11Mar2021, he could not sleep at all that first night and his prescription Melatonin (Manufacturer Rugby) 3mg did not help at all. The falling down occurred roughly that same night on 11Mar2021. The patient stated that they told him they thought he was having seizures again but he was not. He had imaging which showed no seizures and Xray of his brain with unknown results in Mar2021.

The patient was scheduled to return for the second dose 01Apr2021.  The patient inquired if he should get the second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of events kidney stone, blood all over him, could not sleep at all and wobbliness was unknown. The outcome of events sweating and falling down was recovered on 11Mar2021 and no appetite was recovered in Mar2021. The outcome of no energy was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                occipital neuralgia; left-side Bells Palsy; bilateral headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (Lot/batch number and Expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration at right deltoid on 21Dec2020 19:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included low high density lipoprotein (HDL). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (longer than 4 weeks ago, and he did not have any reaction), pravastatin for low HDL. Reported 2 days ago (02Jan2021) he developed a bilateral headache. He stated he was asymptomatic until then. He said he now has Bells Palsy on 02Jan2021, clarified he has left-side Bells Palsy. He said it is unknown to him if the bilateral headache and Bells Palsy are related to taking the COVID-19 Vaccine. He stated he started wearing a N95 mask for the past 2 weeks. He said the N95 mask is very tight on the back of his head. He said he believes he is experiencing occipital neuralgia caused by wearing the N95 mask. He said studies show that the N95 mask can cause Bells Palsy, and the N95 mask maybe a confounding factor. He stated he doesn&#39;t have any further information on the N95 mask he was using. Initially he had a severe headache and administered to himself a sphenopalatine block of Lidocaine 1% in his nose. He stated being an ER doctor, he knows how to administer the sphenopalatine block to a patient. He went to the ER on 03Jan2021 to make sure he did not have a tumor or a stroke. He said the hospital performed a CT of his head, a MRA, labs, and a COVID-19 test (clarified as a PCR COVID-19 test) with a full viral count. He said all the tests were negative. His wife noticed his Bells Palsy yesterday, 03Jan2021. He said he thinks the Bells Palsy started the night before on 02Jan2021. He said he noticed on the night of 02Jan2021 when he was brushing his teeth, he hit a tooth on that side (clarified as left side) of his mouth with his tooth brush. He hasn&#39;t started taking steroids yet, but will be starting steroids real soon. He clarified his doctor prescribed a Medrol dose pack and Valtrex for the Bells Palsy. He stated he has not started the Medrol dose pack and Valtrex. He is ordering Lidocaine 1% viscous for himself, so he can do an internasal sphenopalatine block on himself. He does not know if the bilateral headache and Bells Palsy were caused by taking the COVID-19 Vaccine. The events required Emergency Room visit. The outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered,  Headache was recovering, Occipital neuralgia was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162b2 and the onset of Bell&#39;s palsy/Headache might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

I was walking flight of steps when i felt i was not getting enough air, i went to sat down and was unable to recover and went to the therapy office to sit down, where a coworker said i didn&#39;t look good, my BP 148/92. I felt sleepy, global weakness throughout my body. they took me to the ER where i had an EKG, CBC, thyroid test, angiogap glucose test. The EKG was normal and I stayed about 6hrs in the ER but went home. As the day passed my BP was 122/88 when i got home.  I wore a holter monitor for 5 days but don&#39;t have results yet. I felt fine for the next 6 days. SECOND EPISODE 01-21-21; i  woke up at 5am feeling so sad with despair and feelings of loneliness. I went to  work 11:45am, felt fine, sat down to do some work on my computer and I could feel it come up again, went to nurse station and checked my BP 144/90, i could feel my heart pounding and went to the ER again. I felt super foggy and unable to process things. They did a CTA of my neck and chest and a CT with perfusion which was normal. They did lab work and all was normal.  THIRD EPISODE 01-25-2021, i was at home happened around 9am, felt fine all morning and then i felt another episode come again. Same symptoms just not as dense as before and texted my wife. I had body aches, felt like I had the flu.     I saw my PCP 01-25-2021 (same day as my third episode)and set up an appointment  with a neurologist.

A 65-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history included Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday 14Jan2021. He felt great after receiving the injection, then got a cough and fever. On 18Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he was around someone who was positive for COVID-19. On Friday 22Jan2021 he reported having chills, no fever, body aches and a slightly productive cough. On Sunday 24Jan2021 he checked his temperature and it was 99.5 F. He he took two tylenol and he had not had a fever since that time. Between Friday 22Jan2021 and today (25Jan2021) he had multiple (4) COVID-19 tests that all returned negative. He went to the doctor yesterday morning (24Jan2021) and started on steroids and an antibiotic. He was also reporting that his face was red this morning (25Jan2021) when he woke up. He wanted to know if he continued to be negative for COVID and these were side effects from the vaccine can he still received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He was told by someone that if take a &#39;Regeneron Infusion for COVID&#39; then he would have to wait 90 days to receive the next dose of vaccine, he asked was that true? He wanted to know if it&#39;s possible to have side effects a week after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He asked &#34;Let&#39;s say I end up testing positive for COVID, do I still get the second dose of the vaccine? Let&#39;s say I do have COVID-19 that means I would have antibodies from that and then I would have antibodies from the first dose of the vaccine so would that mean that I&#39;m covered and protected from COVID then?&#34; He had taken a few Covid tests and all come back negative. Caller was wondering if this was just his body reacting to the vaccine. On 18Jan2021 and 19Jan2021 he came into contact with someone with Covid and on 22Jan2021 he took the Covid test. He said that he had chills that night 22Jan2021 and the next day 23Jan2021. He was told by the doctor to get the PCR test. He took the test in the morning and it tested negative 23Jan2021. That night he had someone came by his house and he took the test at 18:00 and took the test again at 20:00 at his doctors office. He said that all of the tests were negative. He said that he was testing so much so he could take the cocktail. The doctor prescribed Doxycycline Hyclate to take twice a day and prescribed Dexamethasone 6mg. He stated that his symptoms chills on Friday and Saturday and he had the start of a cough. He said that he had little aches on Saturday, but they were gone later that day. On Sunday morning (24Jan2021), he was prescribed these 2 things and by 11:00 had a fever of 99.5. The cough was not bad, and he had no aches. He took 2 Tylenol. He said that he took his temperature from 16:00 24Jan2021 Sunday until now, and he had no fever anymore. He would feel a little something in his cough, but it was getting better he said probably because of the medications. He stated that he got tested for strep, but had not received the results. He said that today his face got very red and it was red for about 1.5 hours, but was fine now.  He said that he wanted to know, Does the vaccine have some of the antibodies working at this moment? Due for his second dose 04Feb2021, if keeps testing Negative and the symptoms didn&#39;t come back does he still get the vaccine on 04Feb2021? If he does have Covid and has no symptoms does he take his vaccine on 04Feb021? If he tests positive and takes the Regeneron cocktail, does he have to postpone the the 2nd dose for 90 days? The outcome of events was unknown.  information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                After not sleeping well Monday night I woke up on the 23rd of February not feeling 100%. So around 8:00 AM I took two Bayer Back &amp; Body. Around 8:15 / 8:20am I began feeling very dizzy and unable to stand up on my own. I couldn&#39;t walk down the hallway without holding onto the wall. This went on all day, long after the effects of the Bayer Back &amp; Body would have worn off . Even at dinner time I was uneasy / unstable walking around. The only time I felt well was when I was lying in bed. By the next morning, Wednesday the 24th, I wasn&#39;t 100% that morning either but I went to work and did the work. It was very difficult but by afternoon I was feeling much better. It wasn&#39;t until Thursday that I was feeling 100%. I had never felt this way in my life. No it was not Epilepsy related and I had been taking Bayer Back &amp; Body FOR YEARS without problem except maybe taking two, occasionally would feel the caffeine.

                                                6 days after the shot I thought I had a sinus infection. I received a  steroid shot and  z pak prescription on the morning of February 18. Was still feeling bad and checked myself into a local ER February 22 where I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Never had heart issues. I was in the hospital 6 days. I feel much better and now worried about getting second shot.

                                                Slight soreness in left arm around and just below the point of injection.  This went away around 6PM on Tuesday, the day after the injection.  For about 2 hours around 10PM until I went to sleep on Monday night (the night of the injection), I had a slight fever but it was only slight.  I had a more intense fever (though for only 30 minutes) the evening that I had my flu shot last October when I visited my doctor for a check up, so I would definitely categorize the fever from the COVID-19 shot as very slight.  It was gone when I woke up in the morning.  After I woke up, I was a bit nauseous, but it was so slight (and I have not been nauseous for well over a year) that it took me awhile to actually recognize it as being nauseous.  This lasted for 15-20 minutes and then it disappeared.  On Wednesday morning, my heart went into an irregular heartbeat that felt different than what I feel when it goes into an irregular heartbeat.  I have no idea if there is any relation between receiving the vaccine and getting an irregular heartbeat but I thought I should report it.  I have recovered from all symptoms from the vaccination except the irregular heartbeat.  I put down as &#34;unknown&#34; if I have recovered  from the adverse events as I don&#39;t know if going into an irregular heartbeat was in any way related to the vaccination.

                                                Oral thrush with plaques in the back of throat and uvula. Difficult/painful swallowing. I have been treating myself empirically with Mylanta, Rolaids, gargling salty water alternating with diluted listerine, honey, and basically a soft diet. I experienced headaches, general fatigue, and diarrhea as well, no fever, cough,not even pain or swelling at site of injection. I must said that I am feeling better, but still have soreness when swallowing, and I have lost 4 lbs. I do not know if this is a common side effect,so I decided to report it, I am on Humira due to my AS.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at 2pm today, 3/10/2021. Approximately 10 minutes after the vaccine he became diaphoretic and weak.  He was asked if he had any reaction to any vaccines and he stated no.  Since a temperature was not able to be detected on the digital thermometer and a pulse was barely detected, I administered 2 doses of epinephrine (Epipen) 10 minutes apart.   The physician came to attend to the patient as well as nurses and the EMS.  He was taken to the ED for observation.  Prior to his departure to the ED, patient had normal O2 sats and a normal blood pressure.

As soon as eat breakfast have to go back to bed for 1-3 hours. Same with lunch, eat, go back to bed about 3 hours and same with dinner. Then go to bed for evening. Extreme brain fog and forgetfulness. Can&#39;t think of words or make sentences. Can&#39;t remember anything. Feels like a very heavy feeling in head like head weighs a lot and very cloudy. Pain from shot in arm moved up to neck, ear and jaw the day after shot. Arm quit hurting but couldn&#39;t lift it. Pain stayed in neck, ear and jaw for a week and now is a stiff feeling. I think the lymph nodes are swollen. Effects eating, hard to keep food down. Nausea and stomach pain. I have appetite but have to eat while nauseous and pain. Still severely fatigued every day and have to sleep most of each day or at least sit and rest. So exhausted. Also night of shot started getting hot and cold chills. Still have them over 2 weeks after shot. Bad tinnitus started night of shot and still have it over 2 weeks after shot. Very loud and nothing makes it go away. Bad headache started morning after shot. I have had a headache pretty much everyday, all day since the shot over 2 weeks ago. I feel sick like I have flu.

                                                I got shaking chills at about 10 in the morning five days after my second vaccine. My fever spiked to 102.3. I normally run a temp slightly above 97.  I called my doctor, who prescribed Tamiflu. I had taken two tablets of extra strength acetaminophen and electrolytes via Gatorade, which knocked the fever down. By late afternoon it had crept back up to 101. Still, I didn?t feel as badly as one would expect with a fever that high, even at 102.3, and was able to work from home until 5 PM. At 7 PM, with the 101 fever still persisting, I took my first dose of Tamiflu (and continued to take it as prescribed).  During the night, I could feel myself sweating. By morning the fever was gone. I have had no other adverse effects.

A 65-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at same age, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 09Feb2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EH9899) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing bronchitis chronic, pneumonia, ongoing back issues, which has been suffering from back issues for 20 years, ongoing psoriatic arthritis, ongoing psoriasis, liver transplant from 29Oct2013 to an unknown date, muscle spasms, heart rate, depression, anxiety attacks, blood pressure and hernia. Concomitant medication included amlodipine for blood pressure and ongoing and he began taking years ago, carvedilol for heart rate and ongoing that he began taking over 10 years ago and stated that it is to keep his heart rate between 70 and 80 beats per minute; pravastatin and ongoing that he began taking about 5 years ago; sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT) for antidepression and ongoing that he has been taking for 2 or 3 years; alprazolam (XANAX) for anxiety attacks and ongoing that he has been taking for over 10 years; cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (FLEXERIL [CYCLOBENZAPRINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) for he didn&#39;t cramp up and ongoing that he has been taking for 5-10 years; mycophenolate and everolimus both from 2013 and ongoing for anti-rejection since his liver transplant in 2013. While providing concomitant medications he mentioned details about a historical medication. He was on bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), but was switched to Zoloft. He was switched because he had built a resistance to the bupropion hydrochloride and had to move up in the class. The patient experienced tired on 10Feb2021, felt like he was getting a cold on Mar2021, little cough on Mar2021. The patient was hospitalized for infection after hernia surgery (infection) from 22Feb2021 to 24Feb2021. For chronic bronchitis, patient stated that he was never really diagnosed, that it&#39;s just like having a cough all the time. It felt like his lungs are not big enough for his body and that he got winded quickly.  He was strong and could do manual labor, even after the liver transplant, but that he has noticed the last couple of years that the cold felt like it&#39;s freezing his skeleton. He has had pneumonia 3 times altogether. He was unable to specify dates but he knew that he had it post-transplant in 2013. There isn&#39;t a test for psoriatic arthritis so he was unable to provide a diagnosis date.  He had been experiencing this for the last 10 years. He was diagnosed with psoriasis when he was 25. He had his first shot done, clarified as the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He was supposed to go back to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine but was hospitalized briefly after hernia surgery with complications and got an infection. Therefore, he didn&#39;t make his appointment. Patient stated that his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is now scheduled for 21Mar2021 but he would like to schedule it for somewhere closer. He was a liver transplant patient and that the hospital where he received the transplant likes to keep things in house. After the hernia surgery he couldn&#39;t drive or sit down because it was uncomfortable and that the jostling of the car was too much. Patient reported that he would see his physician who recently retired once a month for a prescription for pain meds that he needs for back issues, psoriatic arthritis, and scar tissue from being operated on 4 times. He has had about 10 Covid tests. It made people feel more comfortable when he shows them the negative results. He has been stressed over waiting for the Covid test, that the stress then aggravates the psoriasis which aggravates the arthritis. After the vaccine he clarified he did not feel right. He said that he didn&#39;t feel sick, just wasn&#39;t 100%. He was tired and felt like he was getting a cold after receiving his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Which he did, he had a cold/cough. He felt tired the next day and only for a couple of days after. He confirmed the tired feeling has resolved completely. Patient stated that he thought the hernia surgery was already scheduled, and stated that the liver clinic called him and said that he had to come in a certain day at a certain time. He received the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine 4 days before surgery. For infection after hernia surgery, patient reported that he couldn&#39;t remember the hospital dates but that he was admitted for 2 days and received IV antibiotics. He was hospitalized on 22Feb2021 or 24Feb2021.  His doctor had told him that the swelling was from the trauma of the procedure. For little cough and felt like he was getting a cold, patient reported that he had been on oral antibiotics after his surgery and his doctor increased the dosage to help with the respiratory infection, it was a cough. Feeling like getting a cold started like a week ago. He was not coughing up green or red, just light brown. Patient unable to provide NDC number or expiration date as they were not listed on his card. He was a liver transplant patient so he&#39;s on immunosuppressants. He stated that he is 65 and if he gets Covid he&#39;s a dead pigeon and that he doesn&#39;t see himself surviving the pulmonary aspect. Mentioned he has had pneumonia a few times in his life, post transplant, and has bronchitis. Patient stated that Micophenylate/ Everlimus were actually poison that fool body into thinking that&#39;s liver.  Caller stated that they lower immune system so didn&#39;t fight it.  He got more colds and if he got a cut on hand it would get infected. Patient stated that he had labs done and a CT scan and labs when he was hospitalized for the infection after his hernia surgery and that everything came back normal. He was just having pain. Vaccine administered was not at facility and vaccination facility type was hospital. Nonadditional administered vaccines. No AEs require a visit to emergency room but physician office was required. He went to the doctor for the little cough that he experienced. He was hospitalized for the infection following his hernia surgery. Patient hospitalized for 2 days was the hospital stay. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no ae following prior vaccinations. The outcome of event tired was recovered on unspecified date in 2021 (as reported), the outcomes of events felt like he was getting a cold and little cough were recovering, while other events were unknown.

                                                Pfizer vaccine, shots 1 and 2, one month apart.  2-24-21, and 324-21. I began getting tinnitus in both ears within a week or so after shot one.  It really got annoyingly noticeable in both ears after shot two.  I would consider the after  effects of each dose to be normal...dose 1 felt a little lousy the next day with headache and fatigue but ok after that, dose 2 felt lousy the next day with low grade fever about 100.5.  Felt fine the next day.  Except for the tinnitus.

On 3/18, he fell to the floor and could not get up. He was admitted to the hospital for sepsis, pneumonia, and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, treated on IV antibiotics and discharged on PO antibiotics. His home insulin was also decreased but continued to have hypoglycemic to hyperglycemic events. Insulin was decreased in clinic afterward and was compliant on antibiotics. Returned to hospital again a few days later for sepsis and pneumonia/effusion. He later went to a nursing facility / on hospice. He ultimately required supplemental oxygen and breathing increasingly became labored. Patient ultimately died on 4/9/21.

Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 22Mar2021 between 09:00-10:00 (Lot Number: EP6955) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. There was no medical history, no family medical history relevant to adverse events.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient felt soreness in the arm and it made him sleepy after the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in the evening of 22Mar2021. When he got back home the same day 22Mar2021 sleepiness began. The patient stated this was probably going to happen anyway, he was disabled and had a bad back and stuff on an unspecified date.  The patient had to drive 30 some miles, 31 miles to be exact to see the doctor to receive the Pfizer Covid Vaccination.  When he returned from the trip he was tired and would go to sleep anyway on 22Mar2021.

A 66-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Batch/lot # EH9899) intramuscular at single dose on28Dec2020 18:00 for Covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history included Covid-19: he tested positive for COVID and received the monoclonal antibody, bamlanivimab on 13Dec2020; other unspecified health conditions which might make him high risk. The patient previously received monoclonal antibody 17-1a, bamlanivimab on 13Dec2020. For Covid-19. The patient received other unspecified medications in two weeks. On 28Dec2020 21:00, 3 hours after vaccination, he was feeling bad with flu-like symptoms, nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue and diarrhea. No treatment received. Covid was not tested post vaccination. The outcome of events was not recovered.  His colleague now knows he should have waited 90 days after the antibody but reporter was wondering if there was information. Since there probably is no information, this is a unique situation and reporter wondered if Pfizer wants him to run any particular tests or send in some blood to Pfizer for testing to further medical knowledge on giving the vaccine within 90 days of the antibodies.

                                                Starting about 16 hours post-injection, left arm was becoming very sore and painful to move.. almost 24 hours post-injection I started getting strong chills. I was shivering and chattering on the walk out to the car (it was 30 degrees outside). When I got home, even though it was New Year&#39;s Eve, I put a light jacket on and sat in my cozy chair most of the evening, celebrated New Year&#39;s with the family, then I had to put on flannel pajamas in order to be warm enough to sleep. I usually don&#39;t have to wear pajamas to bed. And for most of New Year&#39;s Day I kept the pajamas on and a light jacket and I was in my chair most of the day trying not to shiver. The shivering finally stopped late on the First, about 54 hours post-injection. And over the weekend the pain in my arm slowly went away, and by now, one week post-injection, I feel no pain in my arm at all.

During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

                                                About 27 hours after the shot I started feeling weak and had chills. When I got home my I had a fever of 100.4 and I had body aches and a headache. I took Advil for the fever and it came down and chills and body aches went away, but started to come back again late that same evening. I took more Advil and went to bed around 11 pm that night. When I woke up the next morning all the symptoms except the head ache and fatigue, which both got better later that day.

                                                on 2/1/21 at ~7AM pt was noted by the RN to have rt sided weakness &amp; was sent to Hospital ED for evaluation.  They felt he could have had a TIA, or extension of a prior CVA (nothing new on MRI, has small vessel ischemic disease), or a COVID vaccine reaction. Symptoms have mostly resolved, he is not always cooperative so subtle weakness is difficult to detect. He was hospitalizaed, started on ASA &amp; increased BP meds, and returned to his home, where he has resided for several years.

I went to the car, was being driven home, and about 20 minutes after the vaccination I developed an odd sweet/metallic taste in my mouth, followed by increased saliva, some difficulty swallowing, nasal congestion, and some chest discomfort. They symptoms were already getting a little better by the time we got home (about 30 minutes after the shot), but I took a Benadryl and the symptoms resolved within 2 hours. After that I just had the expected arm pain and fatigue until the next morning. Since then I have been fine.

                                                I received the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination on the morning of 2/17/21 with no resulting initial sequelae other than injection site tenderness. Approximately 2 weeks post-injection, I developed coryzal symptoms of nasal stuffiness and congestion without fever, chills, headache, or myalgias. On, or about, 3/3/21, I noticed diminution of hearing in the left ear without signs of drainage, fever, or dizziness. This was treated with a Z Pac, nasal and oral decongestants, and nasal steroids. Over the course of 10 days, the hearing decline had improved, but a clinical exam and testing by an ENT on 3/12/21 confirmed evidence suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss, with asymmetric impairment in the affected (left) ear.

A 66-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 18Feb2021 at 02:15 (at the age of 66-years-old) in the left arm as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart transplant on an unspecified date, immunosuppressed from an unspecified date and ongoing and COVID-19 in Jul2020.

Concomitant medications (other medications taken in two weeks) included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MYCOPHENOLATE), pravastatin and lisinopril, all taken for unspecified indications on unspecified dates. The patient did not receive another vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received atorvastatin (LIPITOR) and experienced allergy. On 18Feb2021 at 06:00 the patient experienced headaches, temp 99.4, neckache, tiredness and feeling unwell. The patient reported that he was immunosuppressed and for him a 1 degree increase in temperature was significant. He stated that he was diagnosed with COVID-19 at the end of July of 2020 and had subsequently recovered. These were new symptoms. The patient did not receive treatment for the events.

                                                Intense pain in lower back and neck in and around where I have mild disc degeneration.  The pain is right where the affected discs are located and radiates outward.  Symptoms began 18 - 20 hours following the vaccine, and became much worse over the next 24 hours.  I also had suddenly had an elevated body temperature and broke out in a sweat in the middle of the night (about 36 hours following shot).  That lasted only 10-15 minutes and then went away on it&#39;s own.   I had the exact same experience following the first shot (2/23/2021, Pfizer Lot #6201).  The symptoms were odd, and I didn&#39;t realize at the time that it might have been connected to the vaccine, so I didn&#39;t report it.  After receiving the second shot and having the same symptoms with the same timeline, it seems that it is likely a reaction to the vaccine.

Also I noted that the 2nd covid-19 dose recorded on the15th of March is identical to the one I received  on February 22, 2021, leading me to believe that the person who administrated the second shot simply copied the lot number information from the first shot that was recorded on card.

                                                One week after receiving second dose, my bilateral forearm/hand, bilateral lower leg/foot, and sensory neuropathic cough worsened moderately.  The paroxysmal cough had been mild for the last year not requiring medication.  I had tapered off gabapentin for all symptoms a year ago, but now restarted taking it to control the cough.  This possibly autoimmune neuropathy began 3 years ago after a trip out of country with a few mosquito bites just about 11 days before neuropathy began.  No cause ever identified and it was thought to be either a viral-induced or autoimmune process.  The symptoms slowly abated over the last 3 years until this last 12 days after receiving the second Pfizer vaccine.  Not sure if a relationship, but it is quite a coincidence when the neuropathy had almost resolved for the 6 months beforehand.   The first vaccine dose was uneventful other than a sore arm and chills for a couple days.  The second dose was even less eventful.

                                                Five days after my second vaccine, at about 8 am, I developed fairly diffuse abdominal pain, and retching.  I left work and went home.  This lasted for about 3 to 4 hours, then let up, but then developed about 45 minutes of profound rigors, which then let up, then my temperature (had been normal) went up to less than 102 F.  For the next six days I continued to run fever, never higher than 103, chills, and some migrating abdominal pain, no diarrhea, normal stools, constipated if anything.  Stayed home from work obviously.  On Sunday, and Monday am, still running fevers, my pain seemed to settle into my right lower quadrant.      My wife, a family physician, helped arrange a CT scan Abdomen and Pelvis, as we were concerned about appendicitis, maybe an abscess.  The scan revealed normal appendix, but several lesions in the right side of the liver thought highly suspicious for &#34;metastatic disease.&#34;  MRI recommended, and had this Wednesday that week, and it confirmed the lesions, with characteristics suspicious for metastatic tumors.  By Monday afternoon, my fever abated, and I felt much better.  Able to return to work.  The abdominal discomfort was improved, maybe due to constipation.  Friday of that week, I was able to get to see my primary provider, who is in Omaha, NE to review the situation, and we agreed a liver biopsy was needed.       A week later, Friday, Jan. 29, I had CT guided liver biopsy at  hospital in Omaha. 16 cores taken, and no malignancy found, but significant inflammatory cells, especially lymphocytes.  Meanwhile I have felt fine.  Decided to do a follow up MRI of liver, which was done Friday, April 2, and all the areas have resolved.    There is an entity called &#34;Inflammatory pseudotumors&#34; of the liver, and my condition fits with this.  It is very rare.     A consideration would be whether it would be possible to stain the biopsy to see if the lymphocytes carry antibodies to the corona virus.

A 66-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19Mar2021 12:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, covid-19 from Mar2020 to an unknown date.    Albuterol Sulfate prescribed last year.  Patient had no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccination information included BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) lot EN6203 on 26Feb2021 12:15 PM in the left arm, dose number 1, for covid-19 immunisation and the patient experienced flu-like symptoms after the first shot, and those subsided within 24 hours. Achiness, chills, sore muscles and difficulty breathing. On 20Mar2021 01:00, the patient had serious COVID 19 symptoms after the second shot that have so far lasted two days, but they seem to be abating somewhat. These were as bad, if not worse from, when he had COVID-19 in Mar2020. He had serious trouble breathing and wheezing with every breathe. He used the rescue inhaler albuterol sulfate. It didn&#39;t do much good. He sat on the couch just to be able to breathe. He thought that he was going to have to call #. After 6 doses over a 5 hour span he was able to breathe a bit better. During this time, he also had severe body aches, sever chills, mild fever, and cold sweats. Outcome of the events was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

She stated that the dehydration and constipation could have been self induced. This started about last week and was home all week. It may have been around 29Mar2021, about 2 weeks after the vaccination. On day 3, her husband had headaches and fatigue on 17Mar2021. The patient was taking Tylenol pretty much every four hours for a week because he was in so much pain. The patient wear APAP machine at night. No history of all previously immunizations.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 02Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. There were no concomitant medications nor medical history. He did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. No history of any other vaccines or events. He got his vaccine on Saturday(02Jan2021) at 1:30pm(13:30) and by 5:30pm(17:30) had very sore arms/arm pain, at 7:30pm(19:30) he had chills off and on and was sweating. He woke up soaking wet and did that on Sunday, but was feeling a little better today. He also experienced body aches and fever in Jan2021. Today is testing day at his work and he tested positive for COVID virus on 05Jan2021. Not sure if it&#39;s a coincidence. Again, he got the shot and then started having all these symptoms at 5:30 and 7:30. Now they are both on quarantine for the 10-14 days. He wanted to see if it&#39;s possible to test positive for the virus after getting the shot or is it just a coincidence. He also had some muscle aches in Jan2021. Last night (04Jan2021), he woke up again sweating, but not like on Saturday, but he got really warm and started to sweat a little, and on Sunday(03Jan2021) he was cold all day and had a tiny cough, but it wasn&#39;t significant. Ever so often she would hear him cough. All of a sudden patient would wake up sweating. Again, Saturday he soaked everything. There was no Emergency Room nor Physician Office. Outcome of Very sore arms, sweating was recovering, of pain and fever was unknown, of other events was not recovered.    Information on Lot/Batch has been requested.

Started 2 days after shot with only other symptoms being the return of sore muscle and fatigue that I had with a Covid infection in mid-Nov.  Shot reaction has been more drastic than the Covid illness for me which was fairly mild.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3302 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol since 90s and was taking medication to keep it down, and ongoing neuropathy in the feet back in the 90s. Patient seemed to be okay after the vaccination until he didn&#39;t rest well last night on 13Jan2021. The morning of 14Jan2021, he had chills and was aching all over. He has a headache, and he was pretty tired on 14Jan2021. His temperature was 99.9. and wanted to make sure he was okay. They gave him the sheet of side effects but was wondering how long it was going to last. He also had fever and chills on Jan2021. He has been just resting all day long which was all he felt like doing. Patient felt he has a bad case of the flu. When his chills started, he noticed he was tremoring and shaking and his muscles are achy on Jan2021. He usually waits until his temperature is over 100 to take something and noticed where he got the shot was achy on Jan2021. During the night he went to aching more. He was not too excited about getting up and doing anything now. He was tired on 14Jan2021, because he didn&#39;t rest well last night and slept in late today. He finally got around, and ate cereal and stuff. He has just been sitting. He would still get the second vaccine, which was not exciting. Outcome of the events aching all over, headaches, and tired are not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

Hx of severe recurrent acute sinusitis until the age of 40. Being sheltered in place since Apr 2020.  Beginning Jan 2021 I started experiencing a little yellowish nasal discharge with slight nasal congestion and occasional pressure in the maxillary sinuses. On Jan 21 received the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Because of no improvement with symptomatic treatment of sinusitis, on Feb 3 started Augmentin 500 mg 3 times a day. On Feb 7, symptoms became much worse: fever 38.2C (100.7F), chills, muscle aches but the most troubling symptom was severe (level 8) face pain. Bouts of pain lasted for a few seconds but repeated about every 30 sec. It felt like an electric shock originated in the nasopharynx and extending to the maxillary sinuses. Pain affected both sides of the face but mostly the right side. Additional symptoms: scalp tenderness, neck pain and light stiffness while moving, skin hyperesthesia. On Feb 8, underwent PCR COVID-19 testing, which was negative.  On Feb 12, canceled the 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, rescheduled for Feb 19. Since Feb 14 no pain and fever.  Treatment:  1. Because I had a thought that I may be developed a nasopharyngeal Herpes zoster infection, on Feb 11 I started  Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times a day. 2. Ibuprofen 400 mg 3 times. 3. Augmentin (stopped after 4 days, on Feb 7).

(Temperatures were in the 80&#39;s)  a feeling of nerve irritation under  the skin that moved from place to place.  unsteadiness on my feet, lack of focus, a basic, total shut down. I curled up in fetal position under a pile of covers for 24 hours. Didn&#39;t fully recovery for 3 days  All simptoms hit me more or less simultaneously within 5 minutes, about 12 hours after 2nd covid shot.  Didn&#39;t seek medical attention, just plowed through it.  I imagined a biological warfare agent would have felt like that. &#34;I thought I was gunna DIE!&#34;

                                                My husband has had a fever and extreme exhaustion every day, all day. for 16 days, since he go the Pfizer vaccine. He is retaining water, does not sleep at night, has heavy night sweats, and is emotionally spent. He has no appetite and forces himself to eat. He tastes what little food he eats. He visited his family doctor, a gastroenterologist, and has been in the emergency room two times for sheer exhaustion and pain. He was released both times after tests. Each time, no one could find a cause and no one sent him to other doctors for help. They would not admit him because there was no guarantee he could see other doctors any faster than if he were at home making appointments. He was referred to an infectious disease specialist by the gastroenterologist, but that appointment  isn&#39;t until March 9, 2021. He will have faded even more by then.

Have come down with severe sinus headaches since getting shot. Upper respiratory irritation continues too. No green mucus or bleeding. Some nights I have awoken with my CPAP machine reading 30 APH other nights 0 to 3 APH. Very unusual considering that I&#39;m also on supplemental O2 with the CPAP.  If I was not on the CPAP &amp; O2 during possible vaccine reaction, it could be bad. Still having bad sinus headaches. Cutting down on Propranolol to 20mg per day per my doctors orders.

Flu like symptoms had started to improve when swelling was observed. Swelling not painful but in area of lymph nodes and appeared to be fluid. Has subsided very slowly but still observable today, now the size of a golf ball.

                                                SUMMARY Two weeks after first vaccine: uncontrollable shaking throughout body, followed by chills, then entire body ache and fever.  The first 12 hours were the worst, but after 36 hours all symptoms were gone.   DETAIL The Feb 3, 2021 First vaccine - Phizer Feb 18, 2021      5:00 pm suddenly came down with shaking throughout my body and then chills.        6:00 pm shaking subsided       7:00 pm entire body aches from head to feet      Later in evening - fever throughout body Feb 19, 2021 feeling better, but still muscle and joint pain throughout body.  Some slight fever.  No appetite, but can smell chicken broth.  February 20, 2021 feeling better but tired      10:00 am COVID test at pharmacy.      Noon ate peanut butter and crackers      2:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      6:30 pm ate full Mexican dinner  February 21, 2021 feeling good with a good appetite.  NO SYMPTOMS.       9:30 am breakfast      1:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      1:30 pm lunch REFLECTION: During entire time, no difficulty breathing or coughing.  And the other symptoms came and went in 36 hours.  The symptoms I did have are the same as a bad reaction to the 2nd vaccine.  (my muscle aches are not a reaction to the vaccine).  Yet, my reaction was not immediate, rather it was 2 weeks and 1 day after my first vaccine.  Therefore, do I have COVID, or a bad reaction to my first vaccine? WAITING for COVID test results.  Second vaccination is scheduled for upcoming Friday, February 26.

Symptoms increased the next night, increasing each day to peak on day 8 (02/19/2021. Symptoms gradually decreased thereafter until 02/26/2021 at the time of this note. Symptoms are now very minor residual intranasal congestion and slightly more significant chest congestion. Symptom trajectory started as rhinorrehia and pronounced nasal congestion that partially responded to decongestants and improved more with nasal fluticasone. Bronchial congestion began after on day 3 to 4, with shortness of breath experienced overnight (never before experienced). Remarkable, intense aerobic exercise was done with no difficulty during the day, with some moderation taken on 02/19/2021. Fatigue did affect daily activities, but not dramatically. That this was a vaccine side effect signal is clear to me.

A 67-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1686, Expiry date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration (arm left) on 18Jan2021, 12:00 (noon) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization, at 67 years old. Medical history included torn rotator cuffs from an unspecified date. The patient previously took Flu shot for immunization. Patient stated his last vaccination he had was the flu shot 6 months before on an unspecified date, that was a while back. Patient had pain in his left arm at the injection site. He is not sleeping because the pain is waking him up. It has been more than a week at 10 days, and it still hurts. It is very sore by his bicep. Events occurred on 19Jan2021, reported as started hurting the next day maybe, it was not immediately after. He says since then he has had pain, and in the past, he has had torn rotator cuffs, and those hurt, but he was not sleeping due to this pain now, he fell asleep at 06:00AM this morning from sheer exhaustion (Jan2021). He says he is very uncomfortable sitting, he can&#39;t lay on that side, and he can&#39;t get comfortable. He was taking MOTRIN 800 mg as needed, and he put ASPERCREME on it. He says that his MOTRIN was prescribed by a doctor, it was the only thing working for the pain for this. He says he also tried Naproxen, then says it&#39;s Aleve actually, he has only taken this once. It was 220 mg, he took one by mouth, one time. He applied the ASPERCREME to the injection site about three times last week, he says he was experimenting here, he does not know. He says he tried ice which helped a little bit, ice always helps, but when it wears out it comes back. He stated he feels the pain walking, when he is putting his shirt on, sitting in his recliner, it is constant. His vaccine card is handwritten, there is no NDC written on there. It has no information about the syringe that was used, NDC/LOT/EXP information were unknown, they didn&#39;t put it down or the information on the card for his wallet. Patient stated he saw a doctor but not for the injection site pain. He stated if it was just initial pain, he wouldn&#39;t be asking but it has been 10 days now, he thought it would be gone by now, he tried to see how long it could last on the paper they gave and called the number from the paper. He says he had no swelling, it was just really sore, he would like to know if this is normal, if so, he can hang on and tough it out. Treatment was given in response to the events.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration (arm left) on 24Jan2021 03:30 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation, at 67 years old. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from an unknown date, stent placement from an unknown date, and ongoing polycythaemia ulcer from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included unspecified normal medicines, diabetic medicine, ulcer medicine, and vitamins. Patient wanted to know if a runny nose after receiving the Covid injection was common and how long does it last. The patient stated that he received the first dose of the vaccine on Sunday and on 27Jan2021 he experienced a runny nose. The patient also asked how long adverse reactions happens and how many days after the vaccine. The patient has polycythemia ulcers and notices that they are acting up. He got the shot on 24Jan2021, 03:30 (Sunday), and the Polycythemia Ulcers are acting up as well as he has a runny nose. The Runny nose was noticed on one side and was initially congested, he then took his normal vitamins and an hour later his nose started to run, this all occurred on reporting time, 27Jan2021. The Ulcers acting up was also on 27Jan2021. The patient was queried when his Polycythemia was diagnosed, he stated that he was actually in the process of it being diagnosed, he has basically had all the tests that confirms, there&#39;s one more left, but he has been doing blood draws and it is almost confirmed. He was just asking his question because he noticed that this did not occur the same day as getting the vaccine and it came later. For the runny nose he took a ZYRTEC decongestant and it worked for a while but did not hold it off, however it is not like a faucet like it was earlier, it was better now. He described his Polycythemia Ulcers being located internally on the heart and esophagus, being at the lower part of the stomach. By his ulcers acting up he means that it feels like indigestion and its real bad, it hurts, he has not had food, it feels like when they take a pint of his blood every month, to get him low in iron, it was like a pit in the stomach that hurts. He took famotidine. He does not know if he should have taken it or not, but he saw there was some problem with somebody in (state name) with platelets. He had the Famotidine about half an hour before reporting time. The patient was asked to clarify what he meant about somebody in (state name), he stated that he was looking online and saw something about a doctor died because of the Low platelet count. The patient was aware that famotidine lowers platelets and was just asking. The patient stated that he was not saying the doctor took famotidine, but his blood was not getting clotting. Regarding Covid Vaccine Card, from it he read PF17c12 but does not know what this is for, there was an expiry but he cannot read the writing. Outcome of the events was recovering.  The reporter considered the events as non-serious.

No other symptoms associated with this. I have rarely had headaches in the past but this is unusual as it happens every day for past 5-6 weeks. Wondering if this could be related to vaccine?

A 67-year-old male patient (Husband) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection and lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included patient considers it to be an actual heart attack. The doctor put a stent in but they think the pain was coming from muscle spasm because the widow maker was blocked. That was in the fall of 2014. He has cholesterol medication. He has medication for high blood pressure and it is controlled with medication. Concomitant medication was not reported. They were vaccinated on 15Jan2021 with first dose. The Wednesday after which was about 5 days after the vaccine her husband got chills, sneezing and fatigue. He didn&#39;t call the doctor and didn&#39;t get tested. About a week later her son had nasal congestion and cough. This is the third day for that. Called her son&#39;s doctor since this is the second person in the house to have symptoms. He had COVID test and it came back positive. Maybe he will develop a fever down the line. She is at a quandary. She has to quarantine in case it is. A week in between her husband and son and it is hard to believe. It should have been her to get it worse since she sleeps with her husband. She and her husband have not been tested for COVID. Only her son was COVID tested. Her husband&#39;s chills, fever, and fatigue started on 20Jan2021. They have stayed home. Occasionally he will still sneeze. Then caller clarified that the night before 20Jan2021 her husband had chills and was tired. He went back to sleep and that was unusual. He had enough fatigue he had to rest more. He went to bed early. Outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information was provided.

The following day I developed a cough which got progressively worse during the next couple of days. Also the following day I started to feel bad pain in my lower trunk area, hips, etc. along with minor fatigue. Two days after that I had what I would consider severe pain in that area. By the third day it started to get better, but still was bad. And slowly got better over the next few days until now where I&#39;m just back to my normal pain level in those areas. The fatigue level is back to normal and I still have a slight cough.

A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9266 (it looked like 9266 or 9244)) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included stroke, balance was always off because of stroke, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, depression, diabetic (has diabetes), liver, enlarged heart, and cholesterol. Concomitant medication(s) included warfarin for an unspecified indication; entecavir for liver; metoprolol for high blood pressure and congestive heart failure; losartan for stroke and enlarged heart; bupropion for depression; glipizide for diabetes; metformin for diabetes; diltiazem hydrochloride (DILT-XR) for blood pressure and reduces stroke; atorvastatin for cholesterol. The patient had his second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 and wanted to know these side effects. He had a sore arm on Feb2021 that was fine and went away on 2021. The following Sunday on 21Feb2021, he had really low blood sugar (40). He never had it this low (blood sugar never got that low like 40). He had to call emergency and went into emergency. He also had to call reported the week afterwards on 2021, his blood sugar was still low. In the following week, his blood sugar still stayed relatively low, not as low as when he went into emergency but it was still low between 50 and 70 in 2021 (also reported that the blood sugar was low the following week, the whole week, his blood sugar was still low, lower than it normally was). After that week, he started getting out of nowhere he just turn around and head started spinning on Mar2021, he was dizzy on 04Mar2021 and he lost his balance (couldn&#39;t tell because his balance was always off because he had stroke so he couldn&#39;t tell if it&#39;s from prior stroke or the vaccine) like he kept falling down and every time he got up he kept falling down (fell down multiple times) on Mar2021 (also reported that then after the week that&#39;s when he started getting really dizzy and falling down)- that just kept happening. He also had a couple of incidents of vertigo but, he usually fall down and got up and it usually go away but this one he kept falling down. He made it to his bed and he was going to call, but he was just resting. After that (now), he had been having off and on headaches on Mar2021. He wanted to know if anyone else has reported this and how long would this last. He talked to 3 of his doctors and these side effects of the vaccination. After the question they said, they really couldn&#39;t tell, as it can be understood that it could be a mixture of his health conditions and all his medications that he takes, cause these things happened he was just trying to find out if there was any different test, what caused his blood sugar go down.

                                                Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness; Almost passed out; Very light headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm (shoulder), on 26Jan2021 at 12:00, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, acid reflux, and multivitamin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, esomeprazole for acid reflux, and ascorbic acid/ biotin/ boron/ calcium/ calcium pantothenate/ chloride/ chromium/ colecalciferol/ copper/ cyanocobalamin/ folic acid/ iodine/ lycopene/ magnesium/ manganese/ molybdenum/ nickel/ nicotinamide/ phosphorus/ phytomenadione/ potassium/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol acetate/ riboflavin/ selenium/ silicon dioxide/ sodium metavanadate/ thiamine mononitrate/ tocopheryl acetate/ xantofyl/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER ADULTS 50&#43;) as multivitamin, all were ongoing; omeprazole for acid reflux; and an unspecified multivitamin.  The patient really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. The patient has been administered both first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. The patient had been having some strange things that he didn&#39;t know if its COVID-19 shot related but they&#39;re symptoms he never had before. About 8 to 11 days after first dose of the vaccine (Feb2021; maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021), the patient had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out or almost fainted. The patient clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8 to 11 days. Also, in Feb2021, the patient had almost a very light headache where he almost fainted. The patient went to the emergency room in Feb2021 and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00 to 18:00 the following day. The patient spent the night in hospital, they sent him the next day. While in hospital (Feb2021), the patient had electrocardiograms (EKGs) of his head (as reported), magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of his head, computed tomography (CTs; CT scan with contrast) of his head, and echocardiograms of his heart (microcardiogram). All of those tests came back normal (okay), nothing abnormal on results. They were relating this to a stroke-like symptom; however, the results were normal, also his blood test results were fine. The patient had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3 to 4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. The patient was not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because the event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit. Because of the first episode, the patient then went to his family doctor and the doctor ordered some other testing done. The patient was scheduled to get a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test (stress test of heart), his results on 10Mar2021 came back normal (not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine). The patient believed that the results of those tests both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. The patient was continuing to have some lightheaded episodes or symptoms just about daily but nothing really; continued to have symptoms which was not normal for him. Sometimes, they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes, the patient had a good day, but he had those lightheaded episodes and he never had it before he got the shot. As therapeutic measures in the hospital, the emergency room gave the patient something for dizziness when he was there, but he was no longer taking it. Currently, the patient was really taking nothing. The patient had also gone to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor where he had a balance test or a videonystagmography (VNG) test done on 17Mar2021. The patient will get results of balance test on Wednesday (24Mar2021). Every year (unspecified), the patient goes and get his yearly test in which they had his blood work done and this and his glucose levels were always good, cholesterol level was always good. All the patient&#39;s other tests come back as normal on an unspecified date. The patient had never had these symptoms before, he hasn&#39;t changed his medications or habits and it&#39;s odd that this happened 9 to 10 days after both doses of the vaccine. The patient would like to know if this has been reported before as a side effect related to the vaccine. The patient was not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. Also, he does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can&#39;t figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines. So the patient doesn&#39;t know if anybody else is reporting this but he had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them around days after each shot and he was continuing to have lightheaded episodes but not severe as those 2 but he had lightheaded (dizzy) episodes daily, since the COVID-19 vaccine. But they didn&#39;t know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the COVID-19 shot. And he never had anything like that, and he was not blaming it on the COVID-10 shot. That was the only thing changed in his lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that&#39;s the only thing changed, his medication has not changed, and diet doesn&#39;t change. Nothing has changed other than the patient got COVID-19 shots. The patient wanted to report it, so the company had a report file and other people reporting it. The patient wanted to know if the company was having any other report or something like this so that he would know if it might be related to the shot. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6203; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly (in the muscle) in right shoulder on 14Mar2021 at age of 67-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen for an unspecified indication, but the reason for taken this drug was &#34;get up and get moving&#34;, the patient took it for many years. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine.  He would like to speak with someone about the effects he had and any suggestions Pfizer may have to help him. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. He received the first dose on 14Mar2021 and on 19Mar2021, he started experiencing side effects. He said all 4 people in his household all got the vaccine and all had side effects. The moment the patient was helping his wife he felt like a sharp needle type pain going through the heart side of his chest. They were little ones, but it was uncomfortable. It caused him to panic. He hanged on to it and it went away in a bit. But 2 hours after that, he had chills and crawled in blankets and stayed until the rest of the night. He has not gotten up since 19Mar2021.  He has bone aches and leg and lower back pain aches. He has a headache on 19Mar2021 and started checking temperature on 25Mar2021. The highest was 104 degrees on 25Mar2021 and ever since (Mar2021) then he had 101 degrees or 100 and something. It also reported he began to have fever on 19Mar2021 (pending clarification). He was told to use Tylenol for fever reducer and started taking it. It also reported he has been taking Tylenol for the headache and fever only and it has not been working, it has actually caused him to have a rash on his face and skull causing dandruff and severe itching and bleeding, so he stopped it. He would like to take Ibuprofen and wanted to know if he could.  When he stopped taking Tylenol, his daughter gave him a lotion for face.  Face is clear and only one place is left that is behind his neck on head.  No further details provided for lotion that he put on the rash. He provided information on Tylenol Extra Strength 500 mg each. He took 2 for rash on 2 occasions every 6 hours and then he started only taking 1 because he has not eaten and felt bitterness in stomach and mouth and was uncomfortable (19Mar2021). The Lot is SSA011 and expiration is Oct2024. He has been taking Ibuprofen for many years and only taking one tablet instead of two. He needs to get up and get going and takes it to help him every day. He did not get tested for COVID, but his wife, son and daughter did and they all tested positive after receiving the vaccine. He assumes he has COVID as well since he has the same symptoms and lives in the same household. He would like to know if he can postpone next dose or can he quit.  Will this get better. If he could take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol. The outcome of events &#34;sharp needle type pain that went through heart side of chest&#34; and &#34;chills&#34; was recovering, of &#34;fever/ highest was 104 degrees&#34;, &#34;bone aches&#34;, and &#34;leg and lower back pain&#34; was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

                                                Vacinnated on Friday..following Sunday evening noticed bumps, blisters, hives on both of my hands in the pad areas of my hands. extended into the tips of index fingers and thumbs. very sensitive to the touch. I took some Benedril which helped with swelling. that was the most severe after effect. I&#39;m pretty sure it was the vaccine because i had not been anywhere that weekend and had not  put my hands on anything unusual that i don&#39;t normally touch. It only happened to my hands. Other than that i had minor flu like symtoms from the shot,  achiness and slight fatigue feeling. I had an ER doctor look at my hands when i went in today to get help for my bronchitis, which i had some before the covid shot. It got worse on Monday. He perscribed prednisone which has pretty much taken the hand spots away..i was tested negative for covid today(1/19/21) by the way.

                                                Shot administered Wednesday morning. Sore arm, but not particularly bad. Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

A 68-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 28Dec2020 at 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included diabetic and blood pressure high, both from 10-15 years.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient does nursing homes and assisted living facilities and also the employees of the nursing home. The patient received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 28Dec2020 at 1800 PM in the left arm. He tested negative on 27Dec2020, 04Jan2021, and 08Jan2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 11Jan2021, which was 2 weeks after the administration of the vaccine. He reported no severe symptoms, all he got from the COVID-19 infection was a little bit of chills, temperatures rising to a maximum of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (temperature back and forth), body aches, oxygen levels at 95%, and no cough. His oxygen saturation has always been good between 95% and 96%. The patient asked what caused the positive test and asked if he was going to have protection after receiving the first dose of COVID vaccine. The patient is due for the second dose of the COVID vaccine on Monday, the 18th (18Jan2021), in which he will still be under isolation. The patient asked if he should wait until he gets out of isolation to receive the second vaccine. The patient asked if that is part of the vaccine to test positive for COVID or if he actually does have COVID. The patient also asked if he can have the second dose. He will be unable to receive second dose of the COVID vaccine at the 21-day mark due to being in isolation from the COVID virus. The patient was recovering from the events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

Medical history included Hypothyroidism controlled with meds. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine. On 14Jan2021 0130 (reported about 14 hours after injection), the patient experienced chills. The chills occurred about 2 in the morning and lasted only a short while. The patient had not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient did not receive treatment for the event. The outcome of the event was recovered in Jan2021.

After 3 hours I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and they suggested I call 911 and go to the Emergency Department to be sure I was not having a heart attack. Multiple EKGs, a chest xray, and blood tests revealed that my heart was in good shape. I have continued  to have very slight pressure in that area, but it is occasional and is almost gone. Even after 5 days since the vaccination, I am experiencing side effects although they have reduced in severity. Fatigue, occasional slight dizziness, occasional shortness of breath, occasional slight pain in various parts of my body.

                                                About 8 hours after receiving my second dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine my left shoulder at the injection site was very sore. I also had a low grade fever of 99.8 degrees and a dull headache.  I took two capsules of Aleve Liquid Gels (naproxen sodium capsules, 220 mg each and went to bed for the night. I woke up the next morning at 7:00am with no headache or fever and the soreness in my left shoulder was much better!

                                                acute myocardial infarction; He was found by his secretary unconscious; feeling unwell; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse.  A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), intramuscular in the left arm on 19Jan2021 (at 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   Medical history included blood cholesterol of 200 (not further specified).  The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included irbesartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 19Jan2020 at 08:00, after the vaccine, that patient was at work and was feeling unwell and the patient was found by his secretary unconscious. An ambulance was called. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was 79/38 and electrocardiogram showed acute myocardial infarction. He underwent one stent placement with the remaining arteries normal. He was also started on ticagrelor (BRILINTA), metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and atorvastatin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient immediately improved and was feeling well and resumed exercise. The clinical outcomes of the unconscious, acute myocardial infarction, and feeling unwell were recovering. The events required emergency room visit and were assessed as serious for requiring hospitalization for 2 days and being life-threatening.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that reported events acute myocardial infarction, unconsciousness and feeling unwell are related to BNT162B2.  The events are more likely intercurrent medical condition for this elderly patient.

Over the following six days, symptomes frogresses to extreme skin sensitivity and diffuse aching of chest cage and muscles, back, associated with fatigue and stiffness of joints especially after being at rest and trying to move. By the 6th day after onset of symptoms, an erythematous eruption developed along the left T7 dermatome, becoming more pronounced on the 7th day, but not the true vesicular rash we usually see in zoster dermatitis. Discomfort is relieved by taking excedrin and tylenol. I did not try NSAIDs due to gastritis reaction. No fever or chills, sore throat, cough, etc. I started Valtrex today  to be taken tid.

He said that the monoclonal antibodies infusion they recommend you didn&#39;t get the second vaccine dose until 90 days after receiving the antibodies. He got the vaccine through work, but he thinks that the (Vaccination Facility Name) provided it, they were 1B at the time for physicians to get it, so it was given through hospital employee health department. On 06Jan2021 he had two positive tests, a rapid and a send out, rapid was a molecular COVID test and the send out was a PCR, he was pretty sure both were positive. He said it was on 08Jan2021 he got the infusion of the Eli Lilly monoclonal antibodies. when he had COVID, he had no fevers, he had a cough just like a cold, and the only reaction he had from getting the vaccine was his arm was sore, he did no treatment for either of these. Eli Lilly monoclonal antibodies infusion: He said that it says it is a BAM LAM IV IMAB infusion, and it was infused over an hour on Jan 8th. Caller says he has had no new medications or recent vaccinations, he had the flu shot in Aug or Sep. The event was not required the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. He hasn&#39;t had repeat tests, it has been 10 days from diagnosis and his symptoms have resolved. He also has got allergic rhinitis, so he takes three nasal sprays and Montelukast, medication came in an orange pharmacy. He took generic levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 75mcg for his borderline thyroid. He took Levothyroxine 88mcg, they upped it. Levothyroxine NDC: 65862-57490, LOT: 57420095A1, EXP: Jul2023. Not any pre-existing diseases worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection. The patient hadn&#39;t been treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 PCR test: positive on 06Jan2021, COVID-19 molecular test: positive on 06Jan2021. The outcome of events for covid-19 molecular test: positive/covid-19 PCR test: positive was resolved in Jan2021, for other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of COVID-19,  suspected LOE and other events  due to temporal relationship.

                                                Within an hour of receiving 2nd dose started experiencing headaches and dizziness. In addition to the headaches and severe dizziness I started having significant bouts with diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite and have not slept well.  Within a couple days I noticed pronounced tremors in my right hand and I started losing weight from 180 pounds to 157, around 23 pound loss.  I contacted my physician and was alerted to make this report and have an appointment on March 1.

                                                After about 3 hours (around noon) I began to feel like I was coming down with a cold and fever. By 4PM I had chills and body aches. By 8 pm I took my temperature and it was a low grade 99.8. Through the remainder of the night the chills worsened to the point where I was shaking uncontrollably and I could not get warm. I was also very dizzy. The next day (2/26/21) was more of the same along with a very painful headache and muscle aches especially in my shoulders and neck. That night all of those symptoms continued along with very sharp stabbing pains in my left leg above the knee cap. The dizziness also continued and I nearly passed out trying to get out of bed early in the morning. My fever had increased to 100.5 at the highest. I was also very weak by the end of the day on 2/26/21. On 2/27/21 I was beginning to feel a bit better but still had that low grade fever (now about 99.8) a headache and I remained very weak. The weakness was especially evident in my legs - it was very hard to stand up. It is now 2/28/21 and I am feeling nearly 100% myself again.   From all I had read and understood I was expecting to have a reaction to the 2nd vaccine. I did not consider any of this life threatening nor necessary to call my PCP. Still, I wanted to report these reactions as it is my understanding the adverse reactions to the 2nd vaccination are common in people much younger than me.

The next day I had chills and my fever went up to 101, I took about 6 Tylenol and 6 Advil to bring the fever down. The following day I was feeling better. The yesterday I woke up with a weird feeling on the left side of my lower lip, it is like numbness, like just it feels weird.  I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow.

A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9269, expiration date May2021), via an unknown route of administration on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 Prevention/ immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included a dental procedure on 18Feb2021 for a cracked tooth from an unknown date. The patient received procaine hydrochloride (NOVOCAIN) on 18Feb2021 for the dental procedure. On 18Feb2021 the patient experienced fever, body aches, chills, and a headache; and on an unknown date in Feb2021 the patient experienced a small ischemic stroke. The patient was hospitalized for the ischemic stroke on 19Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain on 20Feb2021 which showed a small ischemic stroke and white blood cell count which was elevated (in the low 20s) on 19Feb2021 and on 20Feb2021, white blood cell count was normal. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the ischemic stroke which included Plavix. The clinical outcome of the ischemic stroke was unknown; fever, body aches and chills were recovered on 19Feb2021; white blood cell count increased recovered on 20Feb2021; headache was not recovered. The patient was hospitalized for three days. The patient mentioned that he was not associating the stroke with the vaccine but rather associates it with the added stress on his body.

                                                Slight headache about 30 minutes after receiving shot at 11 AM, Saturday, 3/6/2021. About 5 hours after shot I started feeling like I was coming down with something, like I had a mild fever and headache was a little more pronounced, but still mild. By 8pm I had fever of 102F, headache was now uncomfortable, so took 2 Tylenol and went to bed. Fever broke about 3-4AM, but still retained a very mild fever of 99F with very mild headache,  muscle aches and joint stiffness/pain for the following day and the day after. By Tuesday 3/9, head was starting to clear and feeling like I had mild fever was gone. Headache was no longer. Each day thereafter, my head seemed to be more cognitive/clearer and looking back, I could tell I was not thinking clearly, with difficulty remembering things. Since I was not working, fogginess had zero impact on my lifestyle. I should note the first shot, received on 2/13/2021, I had no effects at all. Nothing. Since I was not feeling very well during this time, I tended towards comfort foods which elevated my blood sugar, but that returned to normal levels by 3/9/2021.

A 68-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 03Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at the age of 68-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included paraplegic, he has been paralyzed for 45 years. The patient received first dose of the vaccine on 10Feb2021 with lot number: EN5318, expiration 31May2021. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient went on Monday to the ER for an unrelated condition and they did a CT scan and found a blood clot, a pulmonary embolism in his right lower lobe. He confirms the pulmonary embolism was diagnosed on Monday, 15Mar2021.  He got home that night and read the headline in the (Withheld) times that said several European countries are pulling the Astra Zeneca vaccine over concerns about blood clots even though there has not been any causal relationship found. He thought that with the drug companies, they should be able to have data regarding potential adverse effects for Pfizer so he was calling report that. He discusses it with the ER doctor and he couldn&#39;t really figure out why he had a blood clot, it was incidental to what he was being scanned for, it surprised him. They put him on Eliquis so he is on an anticoagulant, which will cost him a fortune. Today will be the third day he has been on the Eliquis. He is at home and he would say his only concern is that he does have hemorrhoids so when he has bowel movement tomorrow, because he doesn&#39;t go every day, but when he goes he is concerned if he starts to bleed that the anti-coagulant might cause the bleeding to be more significant than it usually is. No further information provided. His only other concern is he seems to have some kind of hypothermia, he is not entirely sure because of his thermometer is not very good. That is the reason he went into the Emergency Department because it kept reading 94.7 and he googled it and it said if it is below 95 it is a medical emergency and go to the ER so he got to the Emergency Department and it was 97.6 and now he checked his temperature again with the thermometer and it was 96.8 so either he has a faulty thermometer or something but he is experiencing some kind of chills.  The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 68-year-old patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9809), via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 05Feb2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure and thyroid. There were no concomitant medications. No additional vaccines were administered on the same date as the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient got his first vaccine on 05Feb2021 and was supposed to get the second one last Friday (25Feb2021) but he didn&#39;t get it because he tested positive for Covid. The patient&#39;s wife wanted to know if he can still get his second dose; does the second dose have to be within 21 days; and do they have to make another appointment for the second dose or would they just walk in. They called the doctor on Thursday (Feb2021) because the patient was having a tickle in his throat (unspecified date in 2021) and the patient&#39;s wife did not like the way the patient was looking. The doctor advised him to go for the COVID-19 test because the patient was in direct contact with someone at work. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 virus (positive PCR and rapid COVID-19 test) on 26Feb2021 and was told not to get the second COVID-19 vaccine. It was clarified that the patient only has a tickle in his throat and no other symptoms. In addition, a lot of people at the patient&#39;s work have the virus, more than 50%. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 68-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 16Apr2021 (at the age of 68-years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; also received co-suspect drug: upadacitinib (RINVOQ) via oral on unspecified date at unknown dose, daily for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. On unspecified date, the patient experienced immunodeficiency (immune system low), tiredness, and joint pain (described as: patient was feeling tired and felt his immune system was low on unspecified date, since he had been doing a lot of travelling and that his joints hurt a little bit in winter). On unspecified date in Apr2021, he broke out with shingles in his scalp and it went down the left side of his head to his neck. Outcome of the events joint pain was recovered on unspecified date; while event shingles recovered on unspecified date in Apr2021. Outcome of the event tiredness was not recovered; while outcome of the event immunodeficiency (immune system low) was unknown. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events (tiredness, joint pain and shingles in scalp and it went down left side of head to neck) with upadacitinib (RINVOQ) was no reasonable possibility; while for the reporter&#39;s causality for the event (immune system low) was not provided.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events (immune system low, tiredness, joint pain and shingles) with the suspect product (BNT162B2) was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  Information on batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The association between the reported events immune system low, tiredness, joint pain, and shingles with BNT162B2 can not be completely excluded. The history of rheumatoid arthritis might be contributory as well.

                                                Not sure if delayed reaction because it was a week out.  Symptoms included delayed injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, 99.2 temp, injection site red (delayed and only on 7th day), nausea, feeling unwell, dizziness, weakness, and hives which were relieved with Benedryl.    Most of the symptoms began on Monday, February 8th and worsened on Tuesday, February 9th with hives.  There was no shortness of breath or respiratory issues.  Injection site was only tender on day of injection but tender and red on the 9th only.  Fatigue, headache,  hives continued on February 10th along with a slight bout of diarrhea.  Called clinic and they requested he go in and be tested for Covid-19 and results should be known in 2 days.  February 11th seemed to be better and as of 10:00 a.m. PST no hives but still itching and slight fatigue.  Again,  didn&#39;t know if it could be a reaction since it is a week out or something else.

By evening of third day, I started feeling muscle ache and elbow joint pain which was quite strong. Waited for more than a week for the symptoms to disappear but it did not. Cannot life weight with my left hand and I still have pain. Last night and this morning I took Ibuprofen. Although the pain has subsided, it is still there.

The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered: Hospital. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient experienced  muscle and joint pain, fever, severe chills, severe shivering, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, severe headache, injection site pain and a severe feeling of sickness. This severe feeling of sickness was the worst feeling of sickness that I have had in my life, only equal to the most sick I have felt in my life, which was the last time I had the flu, which was almost 43 years ago. This began about 9 hours after I got my second vaccine shot. This lasted about 36 hours, the worst of it about 4 hours. Lab data sars-cov-2 test (unknown date): negative. No treatment received. Events were reported as non-serious. Outcome of the events was recovered.

                                                Patient was in to receive his second dose of the COVID vaccine. He reported no known issues after his first dose and remained in the pharmacy for the recommended 15 minute observation period following the vaccine without any problems. He reported to us today that around 45 minutes after having received the vaccine, he started to have a choking episode, something that he commonly experiences with his Parkinson&#39;s Disease, so he and his wife didn&#39;t think much of it. This seemed to evolve into nausea and dry heaves with excess mucus production that lasted for hours. Because of the duration, they decided to contact his insurance company&#39;s nurse line who recommended he go to the Emergency Department to rule out COVID and pneumonia  He was admitted to the ED and ultimately found to be negative for both COVID and pneumonia, at which point they decided that his Parkinson&#39;s exacerbation might have been the result of having received the vaccine. He has since been discharged and is doing well.

Now there are days when I don&#39;t have the energy to do my every evening walk and I tire out after a minimum of physical activity. I feel as though I have chronic physical fatigue with about 50% of my normal vigor. I tire out after vacuuming the floors in my house.  I didn&#39;t experience headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, coughing or other symptoms but the fatigue and feeling weary for three or more weeks after the vaccination concerns me.

Very Erratic and disrupted sleep for Days. The Major Adverse effect is that these Reactions are within the Range of Published and known Effects. I treated them at home with Rest and Some Tylenol, but was not really capable of normal functioning or to be Employed.. But they were Persistent for 6 1/2 Days....   I have spoken to No One who have had the symptoms last this long. It seemed and felt like descriptions  of Real Covid or past Influenzas but the symptoms seemed more severe and longer. I have spoken with many who have had real Covid who&#39;s symptoms and length of illness were milder... I did contact my Physician to advise of this event.

However, approximately 2.5 weeks post 2nd vaccination I began to experience peripheral neuropathic symptoms  on the dorsal surfaces of bilateral hands (C6-7 dermatomes). It felt as if I were in a shower with a fine mist hitting both hands - even though the hands themselves were completely dry!. Only occurred while outdoors walking. No pain/numbness/weakness. Lasted roughly 10 days, starting to abate over last 48 hours! Coincidentally, had my first haircut (professional) in a year 3 days ago. I mentioned that it felt good to get out now that I was fully vaccinated. Without suggestion, the hair cutter mentioned that her 81-82 year old mother had had a 2nd vaccination and started feeling ?bugs crawling on the backs of her hands.? My eyes were like saucers because this was a totally-unsolicited remark which closely mimicked the symptoms I was experiencing. Fortunately, they seem to be resolving....!

Took an additional 25 mg. Benadryl about 90 minutes after the injection.   This was the second injection.  A worse reaction, with noticeable swelling of throat and tongue, as well as difficulty breathing, after the first injection on March 1.  Only Benadryl, and not Prednisone, was taken on that occasion.

Received second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine in AM of 3/16, having had severe adverse reactions (fever up to 104, n/v) to the first dose three weeks earlier. Experienced recurrent fevers (up to 103) beginning by the evening of 3/16, for which he took acetaminophen.   Awoke at 3 AM w/ recurrent fevers, for which he took ibuprofen. Felt better in AM, had breakfast, and retired back to bed. Awoke shortly after noon w/ severe n/v and AMS. Was brought to the ED by the EMS. Febrile (T 39.6) w/ rigors, tachycardic, tachypneic, and poorly responsive on arrival. Continued to experience episodes of emesis, and was felt to have possibly had a seizure episode (&#34;looked to the side and was shaking&#34;; no clear tonic-clonic movements noted). Was thus intubated for airway protection. Initial laboratory w/u revealed presence of mild leukocytosis (WBC 12.6, 47p49L0Eo), lactic acidosis (LA 5.2), hyperglycemia (glu 297), elevated lipase level (161) renal insufficiency (Cr 1.23). extubated on 3/19.  received antibiotics for positive blood culture (streptococcus parasanguinis).   diagnosis: ADVERSE EFFECT OF CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 VACCINE

                                                I had 1 episode following the first injection that lasted 4 days. I experienced severe fatigue, muscle and joint pain, body ache, and headache. I then had 2 episodes of the same but more severe symptoms following the second injection. The first lasted 3 or 4 days and began about four days after the second injection. The second occurred beginning March 14th and lasted until the following Friday. The symptoms since then tend to recur the day following being physically active for a  full day but are not as severe and last for less than half the day.  These symptoms are very similar to those I have experienced on a regular basis since undergoing a series of major surgeries approximately 10 years ago.

A 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm at the age of 69 years, on 18Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known for a history of heart disease, stage 4 kidney failure and polycystic disease. He had been bleeding from the kidneys for a week prior to receiving the vaccine, heart attack and cholesterol. He stated he needs some reassurance and added he has Stage 4 kidney failure with polycystic disease. He already consulted with his heart doctor and kidney doctor and they say get the vaccine. He mentioned that every now and then he gets blood from a cyst rupture. On the day of the first shot he was having a little bit of bleeding in his urine. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for cardiac disorder; atorvastatin (ATORVASTATIN) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) taken for blood pressure abnormal and multivitamins. The first shot knocked him on his butt. He slept for two weeks then he started to pass blood clots in his urine. He read that the vaccine can cause clotting and he doesn&#39;t know if that might have caused the clots right after the shot. He just needs someone to hold his hand about getting the second shot. He has to leave in a couple of hours to get it. He was asking do we see a pattern where people have had a bad first reaction with the first shot and they don&#39;t have a bad a reaction the second time around. He clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 at 1600 in the right arm. He was fine until Saturday (20Feb2021) when he woke up nauseous; really tired; could not get out of bed; and then really didn&#39;t do anything for two weeks. He added he couldn&#39;t stay awake even sitting up in his chair. He couldn&#39;t eat anything because the sight or smell of food made him gag, even in the grocery store. He added he also noticed he started to get the blood clots in his urine the second day after the shot (20Feb2021). On 19Feb2021, he mentioned he had a bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and he usually does not bruise. He stated he felt like he had all the symptoms of COVID. All of these symptoms lasted two weeks. When he finally felt better the only thing he wanted to eat was a burger and fries. He is still bleeding but it is not clotting anymore. The clots only lasted about a week. He also thought he was having a heart attack, but was too tired to go to the hospital.

                                                Eyes began to water and itch; Eyes began to water and itch; Slightly blurred vision; Discharge in both eyes; Sensitive to light; Substantial Fatigue; eye irritation; Involuntary squint; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 69-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6206 and Expiration date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 12Mar2021 10:45 (at the age of 69-years-old) as 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure, seasonal allergies (He controlled them with Zyrtec), hypertension-mild and pollen and grass allergies. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included amlodipine/losartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for high blood pressure. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 12Mar2021, 13:15 the patient eyes began to water and itch, slightly blurred vision, discharge in both eyes, sensitive to light, substantial fatigue. The patient had 2 major side effects. Both occurred about 2 hours after getting the vaccination. Both worsened as the day went on. The patient had involuntary squint because of itchy and watering eyes, dried discharge closing eyes in morning upon rising. They got significantly worse the following day. His eyes began to water and itch, and vision got slightly blurry. He attributed that to his eyes watering constantly. He does not wear glasses and has close to 20/20 even though he was old. He looks at computer and reads a lot. It got worse until Monday, then it abated slightly. It was still substantial. The right eye was worse than left. Two hours after watery and itching, he did not notice any blurry vision. That was later in the afternoon. As he was writing documents on computer and reading printed material was when he noticed it. There was enough discharge from the watering and tearing that when you wake up, you feel your eyes are glued closed. It has improved slightly in one eye. But it was the same or worse in right eye. Sensitivity to light began around 2 hours after the vaccination while he was in the car driving. Substantial fatigue got worse that night and was moderately bad Saturday, Sunday and Monday. It had abated moderately yesterday and then was worse yesterday and today, but better than the weekend. IT comes and goes and is not continuous. He has never had malaria but thinks it was the same feeling of overwhelming fatigue. He does not have any previous pre-existing conditions. It began with the vaccination. He was not a person of hypochondria and was not particularly worried about this. He was not worried about dying. They are simple side effects with any vaccine. The patient was disturbed when he looked it up. He did not see any symptoms being advertised about eye problems and he was very educated about it. Then when he looked it up, he saw others that had the same thing if not worse. He does not have any information for people that experienced the same thing that he read about online on the internet. Many symptoms that people were reporting were much more severe such as: eyes puffy, face swelling and eyes itchy and crusty. He must have seen 30-35 on two websites that reported and many more on websites on the internet. He then said it could have been 35-40 that he read carefully. Everyone in his family had the vaccine. His son had first dose and experienced no real symptoms. His wife who is a nurse had it 3 weeks ago and only a mild twinge in her arm. She experienced some fatigue yesterday for second dose. It was not really important and nothing that has not been reported. He did not wish to complete report. He was the healthiest person in the family, and he was surprised that he got these side effects. After he got the eye issues, he took Visine. Visine Advanced only clears were up for 10 minutes and then it comes right back. He only used it a few times because it was useless. If the vaccine had not blinded him, he could see the lot number easier. Lot is JJB0300 with expiration Sep2021. It was a total size of 0.284 ounces or 8ml. Visine Advanced gets rid of bloodshot eyes like for drunks. He does not drink though. He would not be willing to send a sample and it was sealed and intact. The patient uses the cetirizine (tablet, 10mg, Lot: 0EE27118 and Expiration date: Jan2022) oral from 13Mar2021 at 10mg twice a day taken for eye problems related to vaccine. The patient has been using and thought it might help with eye irritation. The patient took antihistamine as treatment for the events. The outcome of the event sensitive to light was recovering, eye irritation was unknown and other events were not recovered.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

A 69-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 11Mar2021 18:00 (Lot Number: EV6206) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Kidney transplant from 1998, same kidney all these years, on immune medication, polycystic kidney disease from 1998, the transplant saved him in 1998, blood pressure high went along with the polycystic kidney disease, had it for a while, Type 2 diabetes mellitus this was diagnosed probably about four years ago and immunocompromised. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 11Mar2021, &#34;he felt okay first evening, Friday was okay, Saturday 13Mar2021 achy, Sunday running a high fever of 103 F, he started to get chills. Then Around 3am (Early Monday on the 15Mar2021) called the ambulance, oxygen was down to 80% he was shaking uncontrollably, temperature was still 103 F when they took it and even at the hospital was the same temperature. He was delirious on 15Mar2021. When he got to Emergency Room he was in critical section, had to put on BiPAP with 100% oxygen, When in the ambulance they tested for covid and was negative each time he was tested for covid he was negative. He was in the hospital from 15Mar2021 to 24Mar2021, in critical care unit.  He Turned out having sepsis, E.coli, had to put him on strong antibiotics. He developed CDIFF on 15Mar2021, and an aneurysm in his leg in Mar2021 and needed a blood transfusion. They were trying to rule out blood clots and did sonogram and found it. His blood was going down, he was bleeding from somewhere and had to have a transfusion. They did a procedure on the leg to break up the aneurysm twice. On BiPAP for a few days and then did the medium one and then able to take off oxygen when he went home. He came home on antibiotics and tons of medication. Should he get the second vaccine? Is it related? Is it to late to get the second vaccine? following Sunday he had an extremely high fever and was shaking uncontrollably on 14Mar2021. He was told to get the shot by his provider. She had to call an ambulance, he almost died, and she didn&#39;t know if it is related to her husband getting the vaccine. They put her husband on a BiPAP with 100% O2 when he went to the hospital by ambulance and was admitted on 15Mar2021, which he was on the BiPAP a couple days then went on to the second level, then right before he came home he was weaned off of oxygen. They kept testing him for COVID every day, because the symptoms were similar but they tests kept coming up negative. On 15Mar2021, the patient had sepsis, with cultures of E. Coli, and very contagious C-diff, he was sick from the 15th to the 24th for all those things. She didn&#39;t know if the vaccine brought it on if it was brewing in him before that, or if it had to nothing to do with vaccine. He also had an aneurysm in his leg and had a medical procedure where they had to go in and take care of it to break up the aneurysm. The patient&#39;s kidney was failing too while he was in the hospital. The patient missed his second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine due to his hospitalization from 15Mar2021 to 24Mar2021. She would like to know if it would still be recommended for the patient to get the second shot of his COVID-19 vaccination since he is past the deadline to get it, is it going to be too late for him to get the second dose to be fully vaccinated and effective to get it after waiting this long? His first dose was injected about 06:00PM in unknown arm. The patient had a fever Saturday evening, clarified to being 13Mar2021, which was higher the next day on 14Mar2021 and reached 103 degrees Fahrenheit, and he went to the hospital by ambulance at 03:00AM 15Mar2021.

The patient had had serious complications before related to his health problems, but she had never had to call an ambulance before this. The patient had chills on Saturday 13Mar2021 and then Sunday evening he was shaking and it wouldn&#39;t stop so she gave him Tylenol, then she called the ambulance Monday morning. The patient can&#39;t take anything more than Tylenol, and he never usually takes anything. The patient&#39;s kidney function was getting bad while he was in the hospital, his Creatinine went high and was 3.8, which is high for someone with a transplant. The patient was doing better, he was still very weak, he was under a doctor&#39;s care, he was on very strong antibiotics for a month, Vancomycin and other medications which also make him weak. The patient was on IV antibiotics at the hospital and then came home on oral. The 3.8 for the Creatinine was probably at the beginning when he went into the hospital. The outcome of the event Sepsis was Resolved with Sequel and the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                done in his left arm, and it was a little sore; slight headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number and expiration date were not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 04Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies: dust, pollen, grass, and trees. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He received first shot on 04Jan2021, 5 days ago. He has had no bad reactions. He was happy to report. He then stated it was done in his left arm, and it was a little sore. He also had a slight headache that first evening which was unusual for him. So far so good. He was due for his regular allergy shot which he generally gets every 2-3 weeks for dust, pollen, grass, and trees. He lived in (City) and has pretty good allergies. It is said on the allergy shot not to have a flu shot within 72 hours of getting the allergy shot, so he was just wondering if it will be safe for him to have the allergy shot within approximately 120 hours of receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine. &#34;Is it safe or advisable to have his allergy shot done today when it has only been 5 days since getting the COVID vaccine? Is he putting himself at any kind of risk?&#34; He did not have the name of the allergy shot to provide. He said it is just an injection of a little bit of the allergen. He is not a health provider. He was on the early receiving end of the vaccine because he was a hospital volunteer and works in PACU. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Admitted with concern for drain displacement and fever on 1/7/21. The patient remained afebrile overnight. Imaging was evaluated by IR and the fluid collection was deemed to minimal to warrant intervention. Surgery evaluated the patient and concluded that no acute intervention was necessary. It is most likely that the patient&#39;s fever was a reaction to administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.  The patient was deemed stable for discharge on 1/8 and sent home on 5-day course of antibiotics.

                                                Narrative:  Patient seen in ED 1-17-21 with c/c of &#34;bloated with epigastric pain&#34;. Patient with complicated medical history including stage 1B pancreatic cancer (was currently on chemotherapy mFOLFIRINOX), and a leadless permanent pacemaker implantation on 1-11-21 for long episodes of SR with complete heart block following symptoms of syncope (other cardiac history: CAD s/p CABG 2009, PAF, and HTN). Regarding ER visit for epigastric pain, nothing notable was found on workup and patient was to discharge home to rest. There were available doses of COVID-19 Vaccine following a vaccine clinic that same day, and patient was offered and agreed to a dose of vaccine. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes post vaccine with no notable issues. The following day, Monday 1-18-21, patient&#39;s caregiver called facility at 22:30 to report he had a fever of 102.8 degrees and that he had been &#34;feeling kind of bad all day&#34;. Patient was advise to seek urgent medical care and reported back to ED on 1-19-21 at 00:55. Patient wasd admitted for SIRS (tachycardia and febrile) -- patient also reported diffuse myalgia. WBC WNL, CXR unremarkable for infection, UA neg for bacteria, LFTs WNL, blood cultures negative. Procalcitonin elevated at 17.8 -- suggesting inflammatory response. Patient initially reported feeling better on the morning of 1-19-21, but around 13:00 began rapidly declining (confusion, unable to walk) and started experiencing EKG changes (9 beats of SVT). Patient then coded and resuscitation was attempted for approximately 30 minutes. Patient did not survive the code. Coroner has been notified and family is considering autopsy at time of this report.

                                                Patient received first dose of COVID vaccine at 1800 and waited 15 minutes and left on his own accord.  He sat in his car a few more minutes with his wife not feeling as if he was completely well.  He returned to the clinic reporting tightness in his neck and throat area.  His blood pressure was taken 189/99.  He did not have difficulty breathing or any other signs of anaphylaxis but was given 50mg of benadryl as a precaution.  We continued to monitor blood pressure for 30 minutes and did not resolve.  He has a history of high blood pressure but reports that it is controlled by taking Metoprolol and Amlodipine daily.  Physician was consulted and felt it was best to be seen in the ER.  The patient was transported to ER by his wife and seen.

                                                when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain; feel a little tightness in his breathing/ tightness/shortness of breath; on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%; feel a little bit of heat on his forehead; nose dripping/nose was running; seems like it isn&#39;t working; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine &#34;seems like it isn&#39;t working&#34;. The patient stated it doesn&#39;t look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor&#39;s arms are so sore and &#39;blah blah&#39; and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn&#39;t feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn&#39;t know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven&#39;t been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn&#39;t normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn&#39;t immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn&#39;t been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and &#39;on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%&#39; was recovering, &#39;when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain&#39; was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

                                                Symptoms began with 12 hours of injects. These include excruciating pain in muscles and joints, muscle cramping, headache, chills, and a temperature of 100 degrees. At its worse, I would say that it was far worse than any flu I have had in the past, and was worse than the second shingle shot that I received several months ago. The symptoms last for around 12 hours.

Feb 11:  Was very tired in the afternoon and took a 2 hour nap; I do not usually take any naps. Feb. 12, afternoon:  Temperature 100ºF, mild sniffles similar to cold or pollen allergy, sinus headache; felt tired but not enough to nap. I took 2 aspirin.  The fever subsided within an hour.  I took 2 more aspirin every 6 hours on Feb. 12 and Feb. 13.   Feb. 13:  I still felt a little tired but not enough to take a nap. Outcome:  The aspirin resolved the fever and it did not recur.  The headache was very mild and I did not treat it after I stopped taking the aspirin on Feb. 13.  The sniffles and mild cold symptoms went away after a few days and did not require any treatment.

By 10:30pm was shivering with temperature of 101 fahrenheit, headache, sinus congestion with clear liquid running out of nose and nausea. Took two acetaminophen at 11:00 pm. About two hours later, nose stopped running and just had nasal drip. Could not sleep. At 3:30 am  (Tuesday morning) nausea subsided. At 10:00 a,m Tuesday still in bed but felt better. Checked temperature and still 101. Continued to take acetaminophen every six hours as recommended. Checked temperature  in the afternnon and it was 99. Checked temperature again at 9:00 pm before going to bed  and it was exactly 98.6.  Decided not to take more acetaminophen. Got up around 3:00 am (Wednesday morning) to use restroom and  checked temperature. It was 100.2. Took two acetaminophen and went to bed. That was the last time I registered an elevated temperature. Still feel weak and tired six days later.

                                                I was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 13 March, 2020.  After getting my first injection I was fine all that day. The next I experienced headache and significant aches in my joints along with a general feeling of being ill as has been been reported.  After my second dose the headaches and joint pains began within a few hours.  I also had significant diaherra that lasted most of the day of the shot and into the next morning.  At first I thought the diaherra may have been from cheese I ate the night before but that has never lasted like this.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

                                                Started feeling a little tired shortly after shot was given. It has been 72 hours since the shot was given and I am still feeling tired like I did right after shot was given. I am a light sleeper and some nights I will toss and turn and get a poor nights sleep. Last night, Sunday 2-28-2021 was that kind of night. As I type this I am not sure if my tired feeling is from the vaccine shot or the poor nights sleep. I can still function as I always do but being sure I don&#39;t run myself ragged. I have called my primary doctor and I am supposed to be getting a call back tomorrow.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9264 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a clinic (vaccination clinic at county government center) and not received in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetic (watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago), overweight (probably 10 lbs), cholesterol (abnormal), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which was probably 10 lbs overweight. The patient was told that he has borderline diabetic watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago. Concomitant medication included pravastatin from Aug2020 and ongoing for cholesterol. The patient did not receive other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 29Jan2021 after the vaccine was administered, the patient was real tired, kind of felt weak and right arm was sore which he expected. The patient went to bed early about 20:30 and slept solid until 30Jan2021 07:00; like he did not know anything was going on while he slept. On 30Jan2021, he got up and he wasn&#39;t really tired, but he was really kind of numb, like he could not get his faculties together. The patient informed that after about 3 cups of coffee later that day on 30Jan2021, he got kind of sick in afternoon. The patient was really tired, had chills, thinks he had a light or mild fever, was sweating, had some pretty good stomach cramps that felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t which lasted about 4 hours (30Jan2021). The patient&#39;s face did feel flushed a little bit on 30Jan2021. The patient thought he would have to go to the hospital for a time, but he waited it out and got better. The patient went to bed again early that day. On 31Jan2021, the patient felt better, but again not a lot of energy (pending clarification, also reported date 30-MAR-1871) probably because he had not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine on 29Jan2021. The patient still has a little lack of energy yet, but that could be because he did not eat a whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine. The patient informed that he had no swelling in his arm or anything, he was thinking that he survived. The patient was back to feeling pretty good again today. The patient thought that the vaccine was going to work. The events did not require emergency room/physician visit. The patient did not provide information with the primary/prescriber. The patient&#39;s second dose was on 19Feb2021. The outcome of the events stomach cramps, felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t was recovered on 30Jan2021, not a lot of energy/little lack of energy, not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine/whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine was recovering, while unknown for the rest of the events.

This was accompanied by either bizarre dreams or hallucinations during the night. When I awoke in the morning I was very unrested and very unstable. My morning coffee did not taste appealing. By 30 hours after the vaccination I had returned to feeling better, albeit with a mildly sore injection site, and was able to return to normal activity. No treatment was sought.  No further issues presented themselves.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

He was admitted to hospital on 3/16 for acute stroke workup given his VERY CLEAR Facial droop, slurred speech. His CT  Head was negative for acute bleed and his MRI Brain was negative for any acute stroke. He was seen by Neurologist while inpatient and was determined to have Bell Palsy and NOT an acute or subacute stroke.   Prior to taking the vaccine, he had NO facial droop. After taking the vaccine, he received no new medications nor did he travel to any other places. Additionally, he lives in a city and has not been hiking in the woods.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Left ear is currently normal.  I went to see PA  today and from her exam she indicated right ear drum looks normal.  Sinuses are somewhat swollen.  She wants me to use Afrin and Flonase for one week.  If that doesn&#39;t help, then low salt diet for one week.  If still no help, she will refer me to an ENT.

Then about 4 days later he was going for a 2 mile walk and started out on the walk and had not done a 1/4 of a mile and he started to feel warm.  He had pain in his trapezius muscles into his neck, had a headache and had a bad pain in the pit of his stomach, joint pain in his knees and started to get vasovagal event, everything looked bright and the white things seemed to glow.  He then walked back to his vehicle slowly.  Since then every time he does anything exertionally, walking for any short distance the same symptoms seem to come on.  He also has a tired feeling.  He called his cardiologist and he suggested that he should try drinking a lot of water to hydrate himself.  His brother-in-law is a paramedic who also told him to hydrate before his vaccine.   He&#39;s been drinking a lot of water.  He does have a stomach issue, and has been having the nausea but believes that was preexistent to the vaccine.  He has not had any reactions around the injection site itself.  He did have some soreness in the arm for a couple of days initially, but had also gotten a regular flu vaccine through the hospital and had the same reaction with that.

                                                After my first vaccine (EK5730--on 12/26/20), I had absolutely NO reactions. The second one was quite a different matter.   14 hours after the shot, I developed shaking chills. The next day I had myalgias and arthralgias pretty much all over. It was that &#34;run over by a truck&#34; feeling of the flu. Headache, fatigue followed. Appetite was down. No fever.   Slept for many hours.   Now in my third day after the vaccine and not feeling better.   Still, I remain grateful that I was immunized and am taking the optimistic spin that this kind of intense reaction shows my immune system is responding strongly and nicely to the vaccine.  It is miserable though, particularly since the first one was so benign.   I am a family doctor (MD) and am torn between discussing this in my weekly health column which may dissuade patients, some already on the fence, from getting vaccinated. I saw the FDA info confirming higher incidence of side effects with second shot, which was definitely the case with me.

                                                Three to four days after the injection I began to feel muscle and joint aches in my entire body along with fatigue. These symptoms grew in intensity and lasted about seven days, then suddenly diminished and then stopped.  Dates: (1) January 8, 2021: injection; (2)  January 11 - 13: beginning of symptoms; (3) January 16-17: lessening of symptoms; (4) January 18: disappearance of symptoms.   I also experienced soreness in my left arm at the site of the injection.  That began several hours after the injection and was much more intense than the soreness I usually experience with flu shots.  The soreness lasted about 24 hours, again much longer than my experience with flu shorts.  It then suddenly diminished and then stopped--same pattern as the aches and fatigue described above.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 15Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and allergic rhinitis; no known allergies. Concomitant medications included guaifenesin (ROBITUSSIN), levosalbutamol (LEVALBUTEROL), azelastine hcl, and unspecified vitamin (reported as &#34;vit&#34;). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Jan2021 (15:45), the patient experienced mild adverse events reported as headache, mild rash within approximately 8 hours after vaccination, mild stomach upset in the morning after vaccination. The patient was treated with 10 mls Benadryl and chamomile tea on 16Jan2021 &#34;mor&#34;. The patient has been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination (unspecified date) with unknown result. The patient had been tested for Covid with Nasal Swab on 01Jan2021 (Ag) and on 07Jan2021 (PCR) both with negative result. The outcome of events was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration, on 13Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes (controlled by food not by injection), coronary artery spasm (blood vessels that occasionally collapsed), glaucoma, and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included albuterol for asthma, atorvastatin (LIPITOR), glyceryl trinitrate (NITROGLYCERIN) for coronary artery spasm, and numbers of eye drops (unspecified) for glaucoma. The patient had taken the COVID-19 vaccine just not too long ago and had good number of non-serious side effects. The patient was not really concerned with these side effects that she had. On 13Jan2021, the patient had the little bit of pain from the injection site but that&#39;s common with any injection, so he did not count it, but next day the events started, and he still had some, but they were subsiding. The next events happened the next day after administration (14Jan2021). The patient had the injection site pain and the arm is still weak, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, and feeling unwell on 14Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the events.

The patient previously took ibuprofen (ADVIL), Tylenol, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and was allergic. The patient had a slight rash on his stomach before he received his dose. However, on 16Jan2021 he had a fever of about 100F. On 16Jan2021, his rash ran up and down his torso, arms and hips. It was red and angry and itchy. He applied Benadryl, hydrocortisone cream and aloe. He had a regularly scheduled (Institution name) appt and was prescribed prednisone, but it caused nausea and night terrors, so he stopped it. His rash is getting better. His 2nd dose is scheduled for 04Feb2021. The fever stayed just under 100.0 but he kept it all day long and felt terrible on 16Jan2021. He has had a horrible rash on his upper torso and top of his legs. It was getting bad and they were putting everything they could on it. Cortisone 10 was used and they seem to have it in check. He had a (Institution name) appointment and his doctor gave him prednisone to help but this made him sick to stomach at day 2 or 3 and so he stopped that product. Now the rash is coming back and they are wondering if is this part of the vaccine side effects. Caller remarks they didn&#39;t know what caused the rash to get worse, the vaccine or something else. The first dose was on 14Jan2021. The caller confirmed the fever started on day 2 all day long but broke that night and the next day he felt much better. On day 2 the rash got worse and itching like crazy, he remarked he felt like he fell in fire ants. At this point the rash is ok but is starting to itch again, they are applying everything they can think of to treat it.

                                                On Thursday morning, 2/11/21, about 8 hours short of a full week after the vaccination, I experienced a sudden onset of chills/severe shaking, general achiness, headache, severe fatigue and loss of appetite.   I spent the following 72 hours mostly prone in bed, taking only minimal nourishment, and drifting in and out of sleep.  Now, three days after that onset, I am feeling significantly better but am still weak, perhaps because of lack of food.

A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3249, Expiry Date: May2021), intramuscularly on 15Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single, left arm for covid-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications reported as none. There was some/fair amount of bleeding that soaked/saturated the bandage after the shot and a bruise developed that was 3 inches around and was there for 10 days and he still had the bruise. He said that there was also a cold sensation at the injection site when it was administered and he felt a chill on his arm. He said that he was calling because he wanted to make sure the first dose was effective. He said that his 2nd dose was due next week. The bleeding resolved within the hour and soaked the band aid itself. He said that it was not persistent bleeding it was just immediately after the injection. He also had some significant soreness at the injection site and stated that the injection site was still sore if he presses on it.  He never bothered to look at his arm and stated that he noticed the bruise was there about 8 days later. It might have been there prior to that, but he did not know. He had blood work done on the 25Jan2021 and asked for a Covid antibody test and it came back negative. The patient asked should there be a positive antibody test at this point? The patient asked did this mean he didn&#39;t develop immunity? The bruise had diminished but still there. The soreness was still there. The soreness was not sore if pressure was not put on it and was never sore if he laid on it. The patient was asking if Pfizer considered the vaccine to be viable. He was not on a blood thinner. Onset date of events &#34;some bleeding that soaked the bandage&#34; was 15Jan2021, of bruise was unknown, &#34;some significant soreness and stated that the injection site is still sore if he presses on it&#34; was 15Jan2021, &#34;a very cold sensation at the injection site&#34; was 15Jan2021. The outcome of event &#34;some bleeding that soaked the bandage&#34; was recovered on 15Jan2021, of bruise and &#34;some significant soreness and stated that the injection site is still sore if he presses on it&#34; was recovering, of other events was unknown.

He had to be watched overnight in the hospital 2/11-2/12.  By 48 hours after the vaccine, he felt improved and normal by 72 hours.  Note that pt had similar but not as severe reaction the first vaccine(Pfizer EL9882) that I was not aware of til now.  Also note that pt had covid infection about 3 months prior to this vaccine.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male patient with a complex medical history with multiple problems and cancers and debilities.  He received a second dose of COVID vaccine yesterday about midday.  Shortly thereafter, he started having shivers and shakes.  The concern that I had when he called the office was a possible bacteremia.  He was sensitive emergency room for evaluation.  He was noting that he was chilled and was unable to get warm. He said his temperature was up to 100.5.  He had generalized weakness and inability to get up and walk and had malaise.  He has no known exposures to pneumonia or other illnesses.  He has basically been homebound for the past year with the COVID.  He was evaluated in the emergency room and found to have an elevated white blood cell count on the right upper lobe pneumonia on portable chest x-ray.  Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained since he had a urine abnormality as well.  The patient was admitted to observation while we wait on cultures and we treat the pneumonia with antibiotics.

                                                diarrhea; He supposed that he is dehydrated; nausea; feeling unwell; chills; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 71-years-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), lot EL3246 , unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:10 (at the age of 71-years old) as a SINGLE DOSE given in left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing vertigo, ongoing dizziness, ongoing balance problems, ongoing vision problems, ongoing stomach problems, he lost 80lbs in a year, but his weight is starting to go back up. He has had bad health for the last 3 years. He goes to the doctors all the time. In fact, he just went to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) to find out what was going on. He has had dizziness quite often, so there are days where he just don&#39;t feel good but, he thinks it has something to do with his eyes. When he feels bad, he will lay down and close his eyes, and all of his problems go away. He went to see a retina specialist because of his continuing vision problems. The ENT doctor told him he can&#39;t help him. Concomitant medications included 6 different medications.  The patient experienced side effects after getting the first dose of the vaccine. He got the first dose a week ago and he said that he experienced nausea, feeling unwell, chills and diarrhea. The patient experienced nausea, feeling unwell, chills in Jan2021 and diarrhea on 26Jan2021. He had his shot a week ago tomorrow. He was up all night last night with diarrhea, he was up probably up 10 times. He was supposed to go in to get his teeth pulled today, but he just can&#39;t do it. He does have some chills and nausea. He is feeling unwell. He supposed that he is dehydrated in Jan2021. The diarrhea just started last night, 26Jan2021. He got up about 6:15 this morning and that was the last time he had diarrhea. He still has nausea, but he hasn&#39;t had any other diarrhea. He has some nausea from the time to time. He doesn&#39;t have any COVID symptoms that he can tell. He is feeling unwell, and has the nausea and chills, but he does not have any fever. He hasn&#39;t had a fever and he can still smell and taste and all of that stuff. One thing he did notice after he got his COVID-19 shot was that he did not have any symptoms of any kind. He never had pain in his arm, nothing. He received the vaccine on 21Jan2021, and he never felt a thing or anything that would associate with the shot. The consumer doesn&#39;t know if what he is going through is caused by the shot or not. Outcome of the events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the second (husband) of two reports. A 71-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date) at vaccination age of 71-year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 at a single dose for didn&#39;t want to get COVID (covid-19 immunization). The patient&#39;s no medical history and concomitant medications. The wife reported that they both received their first dose for the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 27Jan2021 and since then they have experienced &#34;major side effects, chills, headaches, sore throat, major cough, fatigue&#34; that was just unbelievable and both of them are exhausted on 27Jan2021. She further stated that they both got sick: had a major headache, cough, and chills. She mentioned that the major headache started as soon... he went back to work, and said he is not feeling well so he came home, and he hopped in bed. He got under the covers around 4PM and he had a low-grade fever, it was nothing, a little bit, and her went to bed and then he said he had a headache, his happened immediately. He also had chills on the same day and had the cough immediately. She added that the headache has gone away which lasted like one day, his cough was ongoing though improving, but he still has one. Chills went away, they lasted a couple days, he has recovered completely. She reported that what was unusual, she was looking at side effects, but he had a major sore throat that started that day (27Jan2021) and he still has it somewhat, but it has gotten better. He has somewhat of one, because he said to her on Saturday (30Jan2021), he said he is going to go to Patient First, that he thought he had strep, his throat is sore, and she said ok. She didn&#39;t think he had it thought it was that coughing irritated his throat (she played doctor) but he said no, he was going to go to make sure he had no strep. She agreed so he went to a facility there, but they wouldn&#39;t allow him in the door because he said he thought he had strep, but they said he couldn&#39;t get treated there so they sent him home. They said he didn&#39;t have it, he thought he did, he was given a test (unknown results), they said he didn&#39;t have it, and he woke up this morning, it&#39;s like when you get up in morning, but it has subsided. He doesn&#39;t have strep; he went to the facility to see if they could tell him. She also reported that they are both so fatigued and so tired. She mentioned that her husband&#39;s second dose is scheduled for 20Feb2021. She inquired if this was after the first dose, what&#39;s going to happen after the second dose. She wanted to know if she and her husband can take the second dose, scheduled on 17Feb2021. The outcome of the event chills was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021, as for the events fever, fatigue and feeling unwell were unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovering.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

Awakened suddenly at 23:30, 8.5 hours after shot, by vomitus arising in throat, only just had time to lean over and vomit into wastebasket. A few dry heaves followed, and cough, possibly due to some vomit hitting my windpipe. Did not feel nauseous before, during, or after, though stomach remained a little quivery for a couple of hours. This could have been fatal if I had not woken up: I could have chocked to death on the vomit.

A 71-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 23Feb2021 at 12:45 PM (at the age of 71-years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, cholesterol, abdominal discomfort. Concomitant medications included lisinopril taken for hypertension, simvastatin for blood cholesterol, omeprazole for abdominal discomfort, and multivitamin. Historic vaccination included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 71-years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient had fever, real bad headache, chills/couldn&#39;t get warm, weak, his arm really hurt where he got the shot, couldn&#39;t fall asleep. The patient clinical course was reported as follows: About 12 hours later almost to the hour, he had symptoms including: fever, real bad headache, chills, and the fever ran somewhere 100 or a little over he guesses. This lasted most of that morning on Wednesday on the 24Feb2021. He took his temperature with an oral digital thermometer. He reports his temperature usually ranges 97.7-97.6 somewhere around there. And he couldn&#39;t get warm. He had a mattress heater turned up and he felt weak and since he&#39;s by himself he has to get up to get water and he put his heavy robe on then he got back in bed. He never went to sleep, he couldn&#39;t fall asleep, his arm really hurt where he got the shot. There was a little ache with the first one but this one here really, really was bothering him. When he first got the second shot, he hates needles, it was a little sore and then when this started it really started to hurt and it was warm. That went on to the morning, then it started letting up a bit. His daughter came by and made him chicken soup and he felt a little better, still weakfish. His fever went down kind of far and he laid down the rest of the day. Towards dinner time or so he felt warm but didn&#39;t have fever, he went the opposite from being chilled to being warm but his temperature was around 98. Then later on he was taking some pain medicine, called his doctor and asked what he should take for the headache. Take whatever he has there is what he was told. Acetaminophen-aspirin/pain reliever/caffeine/pain reliever he thought he said it was 250 a pill. 250mg of aspirin 2 at one time by mouth. 65 mg of caffeine. Took 2 about every 5-6 hours. It says Headache relief, caller states he is just about blind, acetaminophen-aspirin/pain reliever/caffeine/pain reliever he thought he said it was 250 a pill. 250mg of aspirin 2 at one time by mouth. 65 mg of caffeine. Took 2 about every 5-6 hours. It got rid of whatever he had. Patient stated he needs to change the thingy on his CCTV. Clarified he uses a CCTV magnifying system, it&#39;s a camera system with the 24 inch monitor. He felt better then he fell asleep around 10 that night and he woke up around 4:00AM on the 25Feb2021. He reports whatever fever he had, he was soaked but he felt really ok then from then on. He finally got up around 7-730 AM and he&#39;s feeling ok now. If he had a fever it broke. He reported it seems to be improved on the 25Feb2021. He was feeling pretty good he started making coffee so he didn&#39;t feel bad and he hasn&#39;t had anything since. He reports his arm is not bothering him unless he pokes it. It&#39;s the same thing with the flu shot, if he pushes on it in a certain place he knows he got the shot. The injection site is not warm, all that went away on 25Feb2021. The clinical outcome of fever, real bad headache, chills/ couldn&#39;t get warm, weak, couldn&#39;t fall asleep, was recovered on 25Feb2021. The clinical outcome of his arm really hurt where he got the shot was unknown.

Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100.; The next day after patient got the first dose of the covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 71-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 06Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included liver transplant, Patient&#39;s liver transplant was 6 years ago. A-Fib from an unknown date. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital in (Name). Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter believes that patients sister has A-Fib. There were no concomitant medications. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Patient received a flu vaccine way back in Aug2020. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was Not provided. It was reported that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer of the vaccine was on 24Mar2021, Wednesday, at 4pm. On Thursday, usual fatigue, that people get, Friday morning, diarrhea 1 bout, and dizziness, gave him water, HR erratic 80, 90 to 70 into 100, which as like AFib, BP went to 64/55, put in in w/c had him lay down, hand cold, weak, drain. He drank electrolyte water. started to take BP and HR and Oxygen level, his Blood pressure was 64/55, She called PCP, the nurse got on the phone and asked questions, and monitor what had happened, monitored Heart rate until 20 minutes it became regulated, in the 90s and staying in the 90s. If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue. Early Friday morning, he woke up patient had one bout of diarrhea. Then patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit. Patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 90s at least it was fluctuating within the 90s. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient also had low blood pressure. The patient continued to drink cold water, and the reporter was monitoring him. The patient did not go into A-Fib again the next day. Reporter has called several people. Reporter has called transplant people, and patients primary care physician. Reporter was asking them questions about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they thought it was an allergic reaction. Reporter asked them if it could happen again with the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital. Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter has memories of that, and reporter does not want that to happen again. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue: Patient did not go to church on Sunday. Patient started feeling better on Saturday, 27Mar2021. Early Friday morning, patient had one bout of diarrhea: Reporter clarifies that patient experienced diarrhea and got dizziness. Reporter knew then that she had to get patient to drink water. Reporter thought that patient might be dehydrated. Patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100: A-Fib started the morning of 26Mar2021. It was resolved completely by the same evening, about supper time. After the A-Fib started, patients heart got more stable after about 20 minutes. Reporter then hung up with the nurse from patients primary care physicians office. Patients heart rate continued to be erratic until supper time, but it was not bad. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient had low blood pressure: Reporter checks patients blood pressure in the mornings. Patients blood pressure is now back to normal. Patients low blood pressure has resolved. It continued a bit on Saturday, 27Mar2021. It resolved on Saturday evening. Reporter is still having patient push fluids. Patient is still currently drinking a lot of fluids with electrolytes.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP7533), intramuscular administered in the right arm, on 06Apr2021 12:00, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a clinic. Medical history included dementia (frontotemporal dementia, behavior variant) from Jun2010 and ongoing, could not speak, hypothyroidism, prostate and urinary problems, and COVID-19 in Dec2020. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism from 2020 and ongoing; and morniflumate (FLOMAX tablet 4 mg) taken for prostate and urinary problems from an unspecified date (reported as 5 or more years) and ongoing. The patient did not have prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 06Apr2021 at 17:00, 5 hours after the vaccination, the patient experienced fever (103.2 degrees), lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair, needed help getting him in and out of bed, conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space, chills, and was so cold that his fingertips were blue. On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. The reporter further explained that the patient experienced chills, fever, lost the lability to walk and needed a wheelchair, and needed help getting help in and out of bed. She stated he was unresponsive but clarified that he was conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space. The chills lasted for less than an hour. She put a heating blanket on him. She added that he was so cold that his fingertips were blue. The chills ended and he ran into a fever which lasted for 10 hours. She mentioned that if his fever would have been greater than 105 degrees, she would have sent him to the emergency room. The highest it reached was 103.2 degrees. She gave him Tylenol and cold compresses which brought his temperature down to 101. He was comfortable. Initially, on an unspecified date, his breathing, color and blood pressure were all good. While he had a fever, she observed that to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths. From a cardiovascular view he is healthy. The local paramedics come and check on him periodically and the reporter monitors his glucose and blood pressure (unknown results). She stated that all of these were complicated by him having dementia. The reporter stated that he was getting better. She was not panicked and was not complaining. She wanted the officials to know that she thinks people who have had Covid should be tested to see the level of antibodies present or a titer test before having the vaccine and that maybe they not need the vaccine. The events did not require visits to emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The reporter assessed the events &#34;Fever (103.2 degrees)&#34;, &#34;lost the ability to walk and needed a wheelchair&#34;, &#34;needed help getting him in and out of bed&#34;, &#34;conscious but was not responding to commands and was staring at space&#34;, &#34;fast respirations/to every 1 of her respirations, he would take 3 breaths&#34; as serious (medically significant).

On 11Apr2021 the patient experienced shivering and quaking and chills, nauseous and vomiting, panic attack, &#39;was freaking out&#39;, soft pain in left side of chest, fast pulse , all provided as non serious. On the same day 11Apr2021 the patient also experienced difficulty breathing, low oxygen blood level,  potassium level increased and extra fluid in his body which led to the emergency room and admission to the hospital. Clinical course was described as follows: everything was going good until Sunday at 3:29 am. Her husband woke up shivering, quaking, and he was freaking out repeating oh my god, so she called emergency number.  When her husband found out that she couldn&#39;t get into the ambulance with her husband and ride to the hospital, so her husband refused to go to the hospital. She states that her husband also felt nauseous and vomited in this period of time. She stated that he had no fever, though. So fast forward to 8:30 am her husband was having difficulty breathing, and she called again and this time they had 7 paramedics come out to the house. She states that all of them were very nice. An EKG was performed because patient reported that he had a soft pain in his left side of his chest. She states that everything was cool with that, except his pulse rate was high. She states that he also had low blood oxygen level. She states that they strapped in her husband in and drove him to the hospital to the ER. At the ER they discovered that potassium level increased and she said that he had some extra fluid in his body. He was a dialyses patient so they gave him dialysis on Sunday evening. He had calmed down at that point and they were constantly taking blood from him. She found out about the COVID vaccine had potassium and phosphate as active ingredients and her husband shouldn&#39;t have that. She also informed that they had to give him a tranquilizer because he was having a panic attack during this whole episode. She says that they gave him alprazolam. Patient doesn&#39;t know exactly when the side effects went away because he didn&#39;t have a clock or a phone. Patient&#39;s wife also clarified that he vomited twice before going to the hospital but then he felt like he had to vomit afterwards but he did not. She stated that his breathing problems didn&#39;t stop when paramedics came and gave him oxygen. They made it to their house by 8:40 am, and he still had low oxygen level, they were still giving oxygen the whole time he was in the hospital. The patient was discharged on 13Apr2021. At the time of the reporting event outcome was unknown.

COVID-19 Unknown, Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia Yes, Palliative care encounter Not Applicable, Declining functional status No. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY; Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission, Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19,Respiratory failure. Sigmoid perforation with abscess. Hospital Course; 71-year-old male prolonged admission for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. No history of colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung mets. Prior resection of bowel, prior chemotherapy. Required management in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure over the time that he has been admitted to Hospital (20 days). He had remained on BiPAP therapy throughout that time, received appropriate corticosteroids, and antiviral therapies. Approximately 1-1/2 weeks ago he began to develop mild left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In the last 48 hours this is significantly worsened. CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained on Friday, which displayed pneumoperitoneum, sigmoid abscess with sigmoid perforation. There is a prior anastomotic site distal to this. Given his overall complexity he was to be medically managed to avoid the need for OR and intubation.  He did well through the initial 24 hours of IV antibiotics, fluids and bowel rest. This afternoon he became increasingly dyspneic, required implementing nonrebreather mask, and subsequently developed severe rigors, tachycardia.  I obtained a stat follow-up CT scan which shows similar findings of free air within the abdomen. Given signs of impending sepsis, BiPAP therapy was initiated, bolus IV fluids were given. Blood gas, blood counts, lactic acid are pending.  He is receiving empiric Zosyn.  I discussed this with general surgery, whom is well-known to the patient. In agreement the patient likely needs surgical intervention. However given his overall complexity and in light of the fact that this area surrounds the ureter, and we do not have urology coverage. It was felt he was most appropriate to be managed in Hospital. Case was discussed with Dr. at Hospital, patient will be transferred there via air transit. At this time his blood pressure appears stable, he is tachycardia, is currently on BiPAP which will be transitioned to CPAP for transport. He has received several doses of Dilaudid, for improved pain control. No further advancement of airway was performed prior to discharge. Case was discussed with family at length, all risks and benefits of transfer were discussed with wife and patient. It is recommended to involve pulmonary critical care services including surgical ICU care as if requiring surgery he is high likelihood for prolonged vent needs.

DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Respiratory failure, acute, Hospital Course; Patient is a 71 yr.. male with history of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, prior bowel resection and chemotherapy. The patient initially tested positive for Covid in early March. His symptoms at that time are mild and resolved. He was later vaccinated and that month. He started having severe symptoms again on 4/3 for which he presented to Hospital. Since that time, he has received full course of Remdesivir and steroids. He had a CT scan performed on 4/23 which revealed pneumoperitoneum secondary to presumed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with focal sigmoid abscess. Patient was weaned down to minimal nasal cannula settings but somewhat suddenly earlier on 4/25 patient had increased work of breathing, became tachycardia, and had rigors. Hospital ordered repeat CT scan which showed similar findings in the abdomen. Patient had been maintained on Zosyn. Repeat labs were sent which were largely unremarkable. Given concerns for worsening sepsis and potential need for surgery, he was subsequently transferred Hospital. On admission to hospital, he had a normal lactic acid and no leukocytosis. He did not have evidence of peritonitis. The decision was made to treat his diverticulitis conservatively. However, early on 4/26 the patient started to develop a lactic acidosis. An extensive discussion was had with the patient and his wife regarding surgery and the possibility the patient may never be able to separate from the vent given his worsening Covid pneumonia. The patient elected to undergo an exploratory laparotomy with with segmental resection of distal descending and loop transverse colostomy. However, as the days progressed the patient had worsening respiratory status that required deep sedation, paralytics and proning all of which were unsuccessful in maintaining his oxygen saturation greater than 88%. His wife, knowing that he would not want to have a prolonged course on the ventilator, elected for transition to palliative extubating with comfort care on 4/30 and the patient expired roughly 10 minutes after extubation.

A 71-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at the age of 71-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was fine and nothing happened until after the vaccine. The patient took the 1st dose on 24Apr2021 and the next day he got very sick, they thought it was just a reaction from the vaccine, then he was swelling said he was not feeling well. The day after the vaccine, the patient was rushed to the emergency room and confined to the ICU. He felt unwell and it got worse and worse, we took his oxygen level and it was at 80%, he had swelling, difficulty breathing and tachycardia. The reporter thought it was an allergic reaction but this morning the patient tested positive for covid, he didn&#39;t go out the only time he went out was to get the vaccine. The reporter asked If he didn&#39;t know he had covid and got the vaccine, will he get more sick. In the report they found blood clots and the doctors thought it was from the vaccine. He was diagnosed with blood clots and difficulty breathing and he tested Covid-19 positive. Events seriousness criteria reported as hospitalization. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

I had similar sx with the firat dose of the two but the second dose was definitley more symptomatic.  My chillswere so bad that I could bvarely open the Tylenol container to get the medicine out.  I should also state that I also had the Covid disease and I know that this is a risk factor for having a reaction.  I think people should be told that they could have a reaction so they do not plan anything important the following day, but they should still get the vaccine. The day following the reaction I felt perfect.

                                                Vaccination on Friday. Aches and stiff joints started early on  Sunday. I hardly slept that night alternating from being too hot to too cold. Monday evening around 6pm: Chills started, sinus congestion, runny nose, general weakness,  shortness of breath. I took a hot shower and later used a rescue inhaler and was able to get my breathing back to normal. I  dressed in warm clothes and went to bed fully dressed around 10pm. 8am Tuesday I got up after a sound sleep and the symptoms were mostly gone except for a little sinus pressure and some joint soreness.

Then felt very weak. At night I could not sleep due to amplified tremor. At night I also had chills in lower half of body &amp; got very hot in my head. Also a very occasional, intermittent, very weak dry cough. During the day on 2/2/2021 my temperature was 99.8.  I was also very weak and tired and could eat very little until dinnertime, when I could not finish my dinner. Slept a little the night of 2/2/2021 but often woke up and had a hard time fall asleep due to tremors.

Per Emergency MD note: &#34;This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.&#34;

                                                I had about 24 hours of symptoms, starting on the evening of the vax:  Bad headache, overall fatigue, body aches, weakness in legs and knees, tenderness on the shoulder at the point of injection.  The headache responded to an extra tablet of acetaminophen, beyond my normal 1-a-day dosage.   The symptoms are now totally gone after 48 hours.  No need for further consultation or a physician call or visit, in my judgement.

This consumer reported for a 72-year-old male patient (husband) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 08:00 at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 prevention. The medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the shot on 19Jan2021. Since Jan2021, his arm was still sore, but he had been nauseated since then. He has no energy. He has had it almost four days. He was fine until he got it and his arm is sore and he is nauseated. He is usually on the go. The patient also has an inflamed liver. He has been sick since. The patient has no appetite, he is sweating, his bones are hurting, and he is tired. The consumer took her husband to his doctor, and they tested him for COVID, and it came back negative, but the consumer does not think the PA did the test right. The consumer doesn&#39;t know what to do with him, because he is still tired, and has no appetite. The patient is breaking out in cold chills, and his bones are still sore. When the patient got the vaccine, he was walking and talking, and by 11 AM that day, he was in bed. The patient had some labs done, and was being told that his liver is big, so the consumer did not know if the vaccine went to his liver. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                very sick/high fever/get weaker/diagnosed with double pneumonia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife).  A 72-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot # EL3247, intramuscular in left arm on 15Jan2021 (at 1500 or 1600) at single dose to prevent covid. There were no relevant medical history or concomitant medications. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2. There was no prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The reporter stated on 16Jan2021 the patient got very very sick. He started running a fever, a high fever a high temperature all day on 16Jan2021 through 17Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night the reporter took him to the emergency room and they said it was from the covid shot. The patient began to get weaker on 17Jan2021 (not resolved) and still with a fever (resolved in Jan2021) and they said it was the shot. They went to a walk in clinic where they did a covid test on 17Jan2021 which was negative and they gave him medicine for possible pneumonia. But he didn&#39;t get any better. They went to another clinic where he had 3 more tests on 17Jan2021, &#34;a covid test, a throat culture/ strep test and a flu test that all came back negative&#34;. On 18Jan2021 his family doctor advised him to go the hospital and he was diagnosed with double pneumonia which was resolving. The reporter stated that the event required a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The reporter wanted to know if he will be able to get the second shot and asking if the first dose of the covid vaccine give him pneumonia. The medicine they gave him did not seem to be doing a lot of good, he was admitted for 3 days last week (since Jan2021 to Jan2021) and he received iv antibiotics. The medicine that was not doing good she clarified was oral pills of azithromycin (Lot: KJ9712, Expiration: Jan2022. NDC: 0781808926)that was to be taken at home. The outcome of the event was not resolved.

Each attack lasted 15 to 25 minutes, and seemed to be alleviated by taking anti-acid (simethicone) pills. Quite likely related the vaccine: 11 days after the vaccine was administered, I experienced a rather severe headache, plus slight general weakness, and a raised temperature of between 98.9 and 100.4 degrees. The first 10 days I had discerned no adverse effects. This has lasted16 hours so far, with little alleviation.

I got up out of bed at about 10:30 PM to urinate and still felt good.  At 5 AM. 17 hours after receiving the vaccine I woke up and tried to sit up in bed and was very dizzy; the worst I had ever experienced.  I could not walk or stand without holding on to something.  This condition gradually improved over the next 10 to 12 hours.  There was no nausea associated with the dizziness.  The next day I felt fine.

                                                The day after the vaccine, I just had a mild headache and mild leg aches, off and on, and took Advil twice with complete relief. Then I was fine until 7th day when I awoke a 7am. I felt mentally &#34;weird&#34; and couldn&#39;t concentrate. Not dizzy. I ate my normal breakfast of lox, cream cheese and bread with coffee with cream and Stevia. I sat at the computer and could not concentrate or even read well, and felt confused at times. Then I got hot and sweaty, my mouth got very dry, I had pains and needles over my entire body, and the tip of my tongue got numb. I laid down in my bed and felt worse. My blood pressure was 160-170/105-110, and normally it is 120-135-70-84.  I thought maybe I was having a neurological event, so I had my wife take me to the ER. I was there about 6 hours, but after about 3-4 hours, let better. The symptoms would come and go, lasting 3-5 minutes, and slowly improved. After the 2nd treponin was negative, they let me go home. I felt tired and mentally off a little. I rested. The next am, I was back to normal and have stayed OK since.

                                                terrible terrible stomach pain; bug in his colon; white blood cell 18000/19500; his blood pressure was out of the roof; could not eat anymore; he&#39;s lost 10 pounds; dehydrated; vomiting 5 times; nausea; feeling warm; broke out in sweats; arm was sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). This consumer reported similar event for 3 patients (for herself, her husband and their doctor). This is 1st of three reports (husband case) and only this case is serious. A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure abnormal; both from 2007 and ongoing; about 13-14 years, he does not take insulin, he takes oral medication. The consumer is calling for her husband who is in the hospital. His symptoms started after Covid 19 injection. He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

                                                Pain began in both my shoulders and neck. As it intensified it spread throughout my body: down my left arm into my wrist, to my back and hip area (i have had issues here for 20 years), into my knees and ankles and into my left calf muscle. Further, it gave me a bad headache. i was so uncomfortable I got very little sleep that night. It continues into the following day and didn&#39;t begin to subside until about 4:00 pm. The pain in my left shoulder and arm continued off and on until today, 03/19/2021, and was at it&#39;s worst when laying down and first thing in the morning upon waking up.

                                                Patient reported he did not have any significant reactions to the first dose of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine given on 3/3/21. I have counseled patient on possible side effects and patient said he has no question. He looked fine after receiving the vaccine. However, after about 5 minutes, the wife who also received the second dose at the same time said he&#39;s not feeling well. I immediately went to check on patient and asked how he is feeling. Patient said he is feeling dizzy but has no problem in breathing. Wife and I were supporting patient in case he fell. I directed technician to call 911 and call for support from the front. Patient looked pale and hands were shaking. I kept talking to patient to keep his attention because he looked like he was about to faint. I had wife removed his mask in case if he had trouble breathing. Patient said he felt better after sitting for awhile. I checked his BP which was 68/48 and HR was 49. Patient said his normal BP was over 130. EMT arrived and checked his vitals and took him to ER due to low BP and HR. I called to follow up with patient after 6 hours. I spoke with wife who indicated that ER monitored patient and discharged him. Since he got home, he threw up 2-3 times but he was ok when I called and was resting. I counseled wife to ensure he stayed hydrated and if he gets worse, then she needs to take him to the hospital again. Within an hour, wife came to the pharmacy and said she&#39;s taking her husband to the hospital again. Wife has no reaction to second dose. She said she took aspirin just in case but she is fine.

Pt received covid19 vaccine on 2/16/2019 while inpatient, right before his discharge on 2/17/2021.Of note, pt was put on hospice care at the time of discharge to patient&#39;s home. He passed away on 2/26/2021. I could not find the death notice in the chart (which usually contains the medical cause of death). This was reported to us from an staff. The following describes his hospitalization: At facility, was noted to be dehydrated and reported to not have been taking his medications or having good PO intake. Per reports from nursing home, patient wasnoted to have difficulty swallowing&#34; and spit up meals and medications. SLP evaluation with concerns for mastication and dysphagia. At time of hospitalization his Na was at 153, also noted to have AKI2. His hypernatremia, aki, and dehydration resolved with fluid replacement. His potassium was also replaced. His constipation resolved with laxatives which also improved his abdominal discomfort. Also, his olanzapine was changed to disintegrating tablet which helped with his intermittent agitation. Currently, he was calm, amenable, and with medication compliance. To help with his poor appetite, his mirtazapine dose was increased to 30 mg from 15 mg. Pt was discharged on 2/17/2021 when family decided to place him under hospice care.

                                                malaise; severe arm pain at the injection site; severe right shoulder pain near the point of injection, to the point he cant move the arm and it is very stiff; severe right shoulder pain near the point of injection, to the point he cant move the arm and it is very stiff; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer or other non hcp. A 72-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 04Feb2021 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9262) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus Had this for 7-8 years. There were no concomitant medications. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was none. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was none. The event reported was severe right shoulder pain near the point of injection, to the point he cant move the arm and it is very stiff. Caller states his pain level was a 9-10 but then corrected this to say it was actually an 8 out of 10 or maybe a little better. The arm pain started on the day he got the injection, 04Feb2021, around 6pm and was noticed to be severe the next day, 05Feb2021. At this point, the pain is about the same since getting severe. He had been taking ibuprofen which he had taken 5 times and acetaminophen which he had taken once. The patient had also used ice and heat for the pain. He also experienced malaise which was very minor. This started the after the shot and he just didn&#39;t feel good that day. It resolved that a same day. The caller&#39;s wife explained that the pain was so intense it was causing him to be close to screaming because he cant use it, and that is not like him. He explained that he is hoping it will get better soon. It was worse at night, it started out ok in the morning but as the day progresses it build up. Caller asked how long will this last. Caller received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Dose 1 last Thursday, 4FEB2021 and is scheduled for their Dose 2 on 25FEB2021. Caller reported to have experienced severe arm pain at the injection site. They wanted to know how long does this side effect usually last and what he should do about the side effects, whether he could proceed with the 2nd shot. AE(s) did not require a visit to Emergency Room/Physician Office. Relevant Tests was none. No Investigation Assessment. Outcome of the event malaise was recovered on 05Feb2021 and other events was not recovered.

                                                In march I started becoming SOB and it continued to progress.  It became so bad that I could only walk about 5-10 feed before becoming totally exhausted, needing to sit down for a few minutes.  My heart rate remained sinus-tach running up to 120&#39;s.  On March 4, 2021 I had an appointment with Dr.   He sent me to the Hospital to have a CTA.  The test was positive for a MASSIVE bilateral PE.  Doppler studies of my lower extremities showed a partially occluded Palpitate vein in my right leg.  I was admitted to the hospital and started on Heparin IV.  I was also taken to the Cath- lab where I underwent a Thrombectomy of my right lung.  The Cath-lab quit working so the procedure was stoped and the left lung was not treated.  On admission to the hospital my O2 sat was 97%.  After the thrombectomy my O2 sat went to 83%.  I was placed on Hiigh-flow O2 via nasal cannual.  On March 8th I was started on Lovenox SQ for 30 day and discharged from the hospital on March 9th.  I am now on Eliquis 5 mg bid and doing much better.

He started to have intermittent intermittent fevers,  shortness of breath and labored breathing. Wife reported he would  &#34;get sweaty and hot &#34; and therefore she would give him tylenol. He saw his pcp 2 days later  on 4/7/21 for these symptoms. In addition she noticed him to present with decline in his cognition and hemibody weakness and swelling.   His pcp was also concerned about diastolic dysfunction. He received an outpatient ECHO.  He was placed on lasix and referred to cardiology. On 4/19 He saw cardiology who ordered EKG and reviewed his echo. Felt that his afib was likely contributing to his shortness of breath. His echo and recent blood work revealed preserved EF. He had occasional scattered wheezes on exam and therefore inhaler and cxr was ordered.      On 4/22 he presented to the Emergency room for breakthrough seizure.  Breakthrough seizure lasted longer than usual (20 minutes), so ED performed a CT head, which showed an age indeterminant lacunar infarct in the anterior limb of the internal capsule. ( new from MRI 2 months earlierI) .

A 72-years-old male patient (reporter&#39;s father) received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm on 01May2021 (at the age of 72-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, tachycardia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 02May2021, the patient was complaining of feeling unwell since receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. Caller states father has been having flu-like symptoms. His oxygen saturation was low and he was having difficulty breathing. He was experiencing a rapid heart rate and currently was being tested for Covid 19, he was having chest ray done, and blood work. his heart rate was like 140 and then his oxygen would go down to 80. Caller states she didn&#39;t know if Pfizer has ever heard of symptoms like that. Caller states she just wanted to know what was going on, he&#39;s in the hospital now. The patient had tachycardia, fast heart beat. Caller states he is 72 years old, he was just laying down and felt his heart really bad, they used a monitor and his heart rate was 140, it was super elevated. Caller states they used the oxygen thing that they put on his finger and the oxygen levels were 80 so it was really low. Caller states he was completely fine, he never went out of the house, he was completely fine, normal. Caller states he does have hypertension though and he drinks medicine for that but she doesn&#39;t know which medicine it is. Caller states the first day they applied the vaccine, he felt good. Caller states the second day, he didn&#39;t feel good, had flu-like symptoms, his nose was very stuffy, he needed to blow his nose almost 100 times, he was not feeling well at all. Caller states her mom had to take him to the hospital. Reporter enquired if my father could take the second dose since he had this reaction and got answer that should not get COVID-19 Vaccine if you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine and had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine. The patient was taking Pfizer Covid vaccine because he wants to be protected. Caller verifies the patient is continuing to have all symptoms reported still. Caller states he was super healthy and he just went there and took the vaccine and he never goes out, so she doesn&#39;t know. Caller reports all of patient&#39;s symptoms reported have worsened. Caller verifies it was an injection in his arm, but doesn&#39;t know which arm. Caller also unsure of dosage given. Caller states they were like no only Pfizer, so he waited so long for Pfizer and finally when he applied to Pfizer and got it, he was so happy and so now he&#39;s so sad because he feels bad. Caller requesting to be transferred to the medical staff at this time. Caller states she doesn&#39;t have time to finish the report for her father or herself because her lunch break is almost over. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 02May2021 which included heart rate: 140- super elevated , oxygen saturation: 80 -really low , covid-19 positive: positive .The seriousness of the event was considered as serious hospitalisation by reporter. Outcome of the events was not recovered.  Follow up attempts are needed. information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 16Apr2021 10:00 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood clot years ago, ongoing leukemia (in remission), coma, gout (he takes a gout medicine), neuropathic pain, pain, high blood pressure, thyroid (disorder), varicose veins and uses rollator (his wheelchair with a seat). Concomitant medications included metoprolol taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; levothyroxine sodium (THYROXINE) taken for thyroid from an unspecified start date and ongoing; hydrocodone taken for pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing; imatinib taken for leukemia in remission from an unspecified start date and ongoing; gabapentin taken for neuropathic pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing; iron taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; folic acid (FOLATE) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; vitamin d nos (VITAMIN D) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and ongoing unspecified gout medicine. The patient previously took morphine; he had a shot of morphine in the emergency room sometime before his COVID vaccine. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 25Mar2021 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility was PRIVACY she thinks. Prior vaccination (4 weeks prior) were none. The patient&#39;s sister reported that they both had their second dose and she forgot to tell the other woman she spoke to about herself because the caller&#39;s focus was on her elderly brother who was 72-years-old. They both received their COVID vaccines in the morning of 16Apr2021, a Friday, and within hours her brother felt very bad. She went downstairs and saw her brother vomiting in the trash can and he just said that he hurt and that he felt nauseated. This continued for a few days, in fact it continued for 4 days. He was beginning to feel better on Monday, but he was still not up to par. Then Tuesday she guesses her brother was feeling better. On Wednesday night she went downstairs and heard him around 2300 to midnight talking to the dogs and then the next morning she found him unresponsive (22Apr2021). Her first thought was that maybe her brother had a stroke so she called 911. In the emergency room he had a CAT (computerized tomography) scan and at first they said that he didn&#39;t have a stroke. But something very unusual was that her brother had a rapid heartbeat and his normal was around 60 but in the emergency room his heartrate was upwards to 120 to 130 to 140. He was then transferred to another hospital where they said the next evening that in fact he did have a stroke even though that first doctor said that he didn&#39;t have a stroke. The doctor didn&#39;t find any further information until 2 days later when the doctor thought her brother already had some blood clots that were thrown into the frontal, temporal and parietal region in his brain. She was a biologist so she can&#39;t say that the COVID vaccine caused this but she thought that Pfizer should be aware of his situation and then she was so focused on her brother that she forgot to tell the other woman the really bizarre things. She had asked certain questions to the doctor based on what her sister was telling her to ask. The caller asked the doctor if her brother was going to be seen by a neurologist and the doctor gave a rambling evasive answer and then turned on his heels and walked out and kicked her out of the hospital. They both had their COVID vaccines in the morning around 1000 or so and she doesn&#39;t know if he was vomiting still the next day or not but her brother felt really bad. He has chronic conditions and he generally just felt bad and he had thought that something was wrong with him. He felt malaise, fatigue, his head hurt and he was nauseated. He ate one bowl of soup that the caller had made for him but he wasn&#39;t really eating. That lasted for about 4 days and then he started to feel better on Tuesday, confirmed to 20Apr2021, and then he felt even better on Wednesday, confirmed to 21Apr2021, because the caller did take him on some trips. He doesn&#39;t drive. Her brother said that he felt feverish and the caller says that he felt feverish to the touch as well but the thermometer said that he didn&#39;t have a fever because it had an error sign when she took his temperature. Unresponsive: Her brother was fine Wednesday night around 2300, maybe midnight, she had heard him downstairs talking to the dogs and she knew that he was okay. Then the next morning, 22Apr2021, she found him slumped into his rollator (his wheelchair with a seat) and he was slumped over and had stuff that looked like had came out of his mouth and he had vomit on legs. He was unresponsive so she called 911 and said that she thought her brother had a stroke. The operator said to lay him flat and the caller was finally able to get him up and then his arm got hung up and the operator said again to get her brother on the floor and get him flat. She understands that this was important and she was able to do it but they all fell down, her brother, her and the rollator. Shortly after this the ambulance had shown up. The ambulance took her brother to the emergency room in town and they said that her brother&#39;s heartrate was fast. She gave them all of the relevant information but she didn&#39;t think to tell them about the COVID vaccine. They said that her brother&#39;s heart was acting eradicate and it was very fast. Again, his normal heartrate is in the 60s and it was going from 110 to 140s and it wasn&#39;t coming down. She told them that when he was unresponsive that she thought he was having agonal breathing. In the emergency room, her brother&#39;s breathing was still not very good and she heard the doctor say that her brother had stopped breathing but then he came back so that&#39;s when he was intubated in the emergency room. They did a CAT scan of his head and his neck and the doctor comes back and said that her brother didn&#39;t have a stroke. But that was not the case according to a different doctor&#39;s later assessment. Approximately around 1430 to 1445 on that Thursday, 22Apr2021, they transferred him to PRIVACY,  where he was in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). His heartrate conditioned to being very fast. He went from the emergency room to the ICU. Thursday when he got transferred to the ICU they didn&#39;t do any diagnostic tests that day, he was still intubated and his heartrate was still up into the next day, Friday, 23Apr2021. It wasn&#39;t until late in the afternoon that a doctor came in and said that her brother did have a stroke he has even had prior strokes too. They had done an MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) on Friday of his brain, which was not what they did in the first emergency room, that showed that he had a stroke in his temporal, frontal and parietal regions of his brain. At first caller states that on Saturday, he opened his eyes but he was still unresponsive essentially but then she says that this statement was wrong because he actually didn&#39;t respond that quickly. He has gone into a coma once before and when he had came out of it a very unpleasant thing happened that was very personal so she was not going to tell it. On Saturday and Sunday the doctor didn&#39;t want to answer the callers questions, this was a different doctor than the first ICU doctor and this one didn&#39;t have good bedside manner. Finally on Monday, 26Apr2021, her brother started responding. He was moving his legs with purpose, he had tried to kick the nurse, and he had made some words. The day before this, on Sunday the caller had brought the priest in to bless her brother and he sort of nodded and he seemed to make movements but he was still not able to talk. Monday he said what sounded like words and then Tuesday he made, what seemed to her like, meaningful statements. She was told that he had an ultrasound of his neck to see if he had any clogged arteries or veins and the nurse said that the test results came back good that their were no clogs. But this was where the whole story just becomes awful. Caller discusses how there were issues with a cousin having power of attorney from 2015 that was supposedly no longer valid according to the caller and she had spoke with administration and then she got kicked out of the hospital on Tuesday because of a question she had asked the doctor about her brother seeing a neurologist. The doctor said that the neurologist makes his own schedule and it might be 10 days or more if he even decided he wanted to see her brother. When the doctor asked the caller how would she like her brother&#39;s care to be she mentioned that he was in a coma before and was being treated for similar circumstances from PRIVACY and that he was seen by a neurologist and she said that maybe her brother should be seen by PRIVACY and the doctor walked out and within minutes she was being escorted out of the hospital for belittling the doctor and calling administration. Now they won&#39;t even let flowers be delivered to her brother. Unfortunately the person who has been involved with him the most, the caller, was now barred from him. She was not saying that this was all due to the Pfizer COVID vaccine but why were they saying that she has a blood clot too. She has had headaches but they may be due to stress. She didn&#39;t feel sick like her brother. She has a question and she was really scared about the answer. She was just now reading that if you&#39;re on immunosuppressant drugs then you&#39;re not supposed to have the COVID vaccine. She asked was that true. Well her brother was in remission for leukemia and he was on a cancer medication called imatinib. Caller declined to speak to medical information about this and says it was already too late because he was already taking it and she doesn&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t stop them. Her brother&#39;s friends have tried to call and they were all getting the same statement, which she believes the hospital was stone walling, but the hospital says that they don&#39;t have a patient by his name and they have even told the florist the same thing. So caller was unsure if her brother has been discharged or not. He didn&#39;t seem to be in the shape to be shipped to a care facility but she doesn&#39;t know. It was hard for her to piece it all together. The hospital wasn&#39;t feeding her brother enough before she left so for all she knows they could be starving him to death and holding nutrition from him. History/ Investigations: His medications were ones that he has been taking for years and she doesn&#39;t know exact start dates for any and if she needs to she can get the dosage information from the pharmacy. Her brother has hid his pills before and he puts them in different bottles, it was a nightmare. He takes a gout medicine and she doesn&#39;t know the name of it. Those were the main ones that he takes other than the cancer medicine she said earlier. And he also takes gabapentin for some of his neuropathic pain and he takes something at night and a few others she thinks. For medical conditions the only thing that she knows was that many years ago he had a blood clot but she can&#39;t really say what year it was. She does know that her brother wasn&#39;t on any blood thinners to he knowledge and not long ago he had an ultrasound of his legs to determine if he had a blood clot but she was not 100 % sure if he had that but she thinks he did. Her brother told her that years ago he had blood clots that were due to weight lifting causing varicose veins and later they collateralized and they found out that the other secondary vessels took over for pumping his blood so it wasn&#39;t a problem. Her concern was can someone from Pfizer talk to her about what&#39;s going on with her brother, she knows Pfizer doesn&#39;t have his records but how will Pfizer be able to determine if this was from the COVID vaccine. She guesses that she was curious about what may of caused the blood clots. She mentioned the COVID vaccine to one doctor and he didn&#39;t seem like she respected her knowledge. She asked was there anything that can be done to help her brother if it was a blood clot. She was upset that the hospital and her wanting her brother to see a neurologist and beginning with a claim that he didn&#39;t have a stroke and then a claim that he did. She thinks that they were not doing enough for her brother and they were just saying oh well, it was all due to a fast heart rate which can happen as a result of the COVID vaccine. She was going to be honest, she was exhausted and she can&#39;t keep talking for a long time. She asked if she can call medical information back later when she was more refreshed. Consumer further stated that her brother had complaints of feeling ill, feverish and having no appetite. Caller stated that the next Thursday she found her brother unconscious, heart rate was elevated 120 to140 beats per minute and that her brother had a stroke. The outcome was recovered on 21Apr2021 for the events Malaise, Nauseated, Fatigue, Headache and Appetite absent; recovering for the event Vomiting; and unknown for the rest of the events.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

By morning it was fading away and within 24 hours rash was gone with slight lump that gradually faded away over the next 24 hours. There may have been a slight red flushing lower inner surface of the same arm that still seems to be there, but no elevated temperature, tenderness or significant redness compared to the original localized rash. The injection site never reddened but had a slight tenderness for 24-48 hours.

Then a couple of days later I realized that I had low grain headaches (which never have), sneezing, running nose, and feeling flushed.  What clued me in to paying more attention to these symptoms:  I found myself two days in a row opening windows (in winter) because I was feeling hot/flushed and since I almost never have a fever, it took me a day to figure out that the hot/flushed feeling, plus other symptoms was probably a low grade reaction to the vaccination.  A week later, I remain stuffed up but the headache is going away and I have not felt flushed yesterday or today.

A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose  of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 12:45 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included borderline prehypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) and enalapril maleate (ENALAPRIL MALEATE). The patient previously took anticoagulant citrate dextrose and experienced drug hypersensitivity. After the patient received the vaccine, the patient felt OK, just fatigued the rest of the day, nothing out of the ordinary for a vaccination. Patient woke up early in 14Jan2021, 06:00 with some minor heart palpitations. As the day progressed, they got more frequent and lasted longer (had one about every hour and half and they lasted 20 to 30 minutes). By the evening of 14Jan2021 he told his wife about the problem. In the morning of 15Jan2021 it&#39;s still occurring but not as frequently, but they did last just as long. By evening they were less frequent and lasting quite a bit shorter (10 to 15 minutes). On 16Jan2021, it only happened about a dozen times and lasted less than 5 minutes. On 17Jan2021, he only had a couple of occurrences. Today (18Jan2021), by 12:45 PM, patient  have had only 2 occurrences. The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient did not have Covid prior to vaccination and was not tested positive prior and post vaccination.

                                                The day after the vaccination ( Monday, 2/14) I was lethargic  when I got up in the morning and by mid afternoon I had a fever of 100 degrees (orally).  I took 2 extra strength tylenol around 4 pm and 2 more when I went to sleep around 10:30 pm. I felt much better when I woke up on Sunday(no lethargy, didn?t feel feverish) but around 2 pm I noticed a red, blotches rash all around my neck, and my upper torso. There?s was also a rash on  the right side of my upper back. I called my PCP but the office was closed for President?s Day. I didn?t feel that the symptoms warranted going to the ER, but I took 2 25mg tabs of Benadryl at 3 pm. It is now 7 pm and the rash on my neck and upper torso looks unchanged but, I also noticed it had spread to the crook of both elbows Otherwise, still feel fine. Body temperature is 98.9 orally, which is slightly higher than my normal temperature, which tends to be around 98 degrees. I  had a similar, but, much more severe reaction to Ibuprofen about 10 years ago, though it started out in similar fashion and got progressively worse over 3 - 4 days. I had to go on a regimen of Prednisone for 2 weeks to bring it under control

A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9251), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 07:00 at 0.3 mL, single on left arm to prevent COVID virus (COVID-19 immunization). Medical history included myasthenia gravis, and an ongoing autoimmune disorder. Patient has no family medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The patient did not receive additional vaccines on the same date as Pfizer suspect. On 20Jan2021, the patient experienced general feeling of malaise, prickly feeling through his body, which lasted a few hours and fever of 101 degrees. On the same day (20Jan2021), patient had general flu-type feeling that lasted the whole day. He was fine the next morning (21Jan2021), when he woke up. The events were considered serious and medically significant by the reporter. The events did not require a visit to a physician or to an emergency room. The patient underwent Gammunoglobulin blood test with unknown results on an unspecified date.

A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included heart rate irregular and blood pressure high. Concomitant medications were none. The patient said he had an irregular heartbeat after getting his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021. He said he had to go to the Emergency Room on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He clarified he checked his blood pressure at home and his blood pressure was low at 91/73. He said he also had a high pulse rate of 160, or better, for 9-1/2 hours. He said the only thing he can attribute his low blood pressure and high pulse rate to is the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he hasn&#39;t heard anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine being related to having an effect on the heart, but he personally believes it was his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose that caused his low blood pressure and high pulse rate. He clarified after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021, he had a sore right arm after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, fatigue, tiredness, and nausea. He said on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he recognized a small amount of chills, feeling feverish without having a fever, and sweating. He said his wife checked his temperature a few times on Saturday, 30Jan2021, and he never had a fever, but he felt clammy. He said he had noticed the nausea more than anything else. He said he maybe should have checked his blood pressure on Saturday, 30Jan2021. He said he didn&#39;t check his blood pressure until Sunday morning, 31Jan2021, and when he saw his low blood pressure and high pulse rate, he called the hospital and eventually drove to the Emergency Room. He said by the time he had got to the Emergency Room his blood pressure had went up to &#34;100 and something&#34;, but his pulse rate never changed, and his pulse was still 160. He said the doctor gave him several medications to try to get his pulse rate to come down. He said the doctor had given him a medication that was supposed to bring his pulse down. He said then the doctor had to add something else in a syringe to go with the other medication to bring his pulse down. He said he wasn&#39;t sure of the medication&#39;s name. He clarified he never noticed his pulse rate was high until he took his blood pressure on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he felt the nausea start later Friday evening (29Jan2021). He said he already has stomach trouble anyways that he takes medicine for, so he took a pill, but the nausea continued. He clarified he took 1 Omeprazole 20mg capsule that was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, but stated the Omeprazole 20mg prescription looked like it expired in 2017. He said he knows he has a newer Omeprazole prescription, but did not know where the prescription bottle was. He reported on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he just laid around. He said he did not feel as bad on Saturday, as he did on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he called the Emergency Room on Sunday morning, and went to the Emergency Room. He said he didn&#39;t feel his 160 pulse rate. He said he was told by the doctor in the Emergency Room that his fast heart rate had his heart beating like he was having a stress test. He reported he doesn&#39;t know if he wants to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot after what he experienced this past weekend. He reported he only takes blood pressure medicine that he has  been on for a while. He reported he had several EKGs done on Sunday, 31Jan2021, while he was in the Emergency Room. He said the EKG showed Atrial Fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 160s. He reported while he was in the Emergency Room he was given IV Heparin, IV Potassium, Potassium pills, and Amiodarone in a pill and IV form. He said the doctor added another IV medicine in a syringe, but he doesn&#39;t know the name of the medicine. He said the doctor also gave him IV Morphine because he had pain in his chest. He said the doctor said his chest pain was being caused by his heart trying to go back into a regular rhythm.  He reported he was in the Emergency Room for 11-12 hours before he was admitted to the hospital. He said his pulse rate wasn&#39;t coming down and stayed at 160 for 9-1/2 hours. He said the doctor wanted to admit him to the hospital, so he could have a procedure to make sure the high pulse rate didn&#39;t damage his heart. He said on Monday, 01Feb2021, he had a procedure where they went through his wrist and put a dye in his heart to see if the stress from his high pulse rate damaged his heart. He said his heart wasn&#39;t damaged, so he was discharged from the hospital later in the day on 01Feb2021. He clarified his blood pressure was good by the time the first or second EKG was performed in the Emergency Room. He clarified he already had an issue with sweating before he received his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he is still sweating, but he doesn&#39;t know if that is because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical outcome of high pulse rate and blood pressure low was recovered on 31Jan2021; nausea, fatigue/tiredness recovered on 02Feb2021; chills, feeling feverish recovered on an unspecified date; sweating was not recovered; while for the other events was unknown.

                                                First dose received 01/22/2021 and second dose on above date (02/11/2021) These events may have no relation to the vaccination but due to their concomitance, I eventually felt it might be best to report them. Three days following the first dose, I started to experience hematuria as well as constipation. It has happened before as a result of radiation treatment back in 2005/2006. Saw my urologist on 02/02/2021, and  had several tests, ruling out any return of cancer. Antibiotics improved the situation, which was getting closer to normal prior to getting the second dose. Again, three days following the second dose, hematuria returned and still prevails at various degrees. Also experience fatigue and weight loss.

ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY, I HAD A PAIN IN MY LEFT ARM FROM THE INJECTION SITE DOWN THRU MY ELBOW JOINT AND CONTINUING ON TO MY LEFT WRIST.  I HAVE HAD THE PAIN EVER SINCE.  I DID NOT REALIZE THAT TIREDNESS, MUSCLE PAIN, JOINT PAIN AND FEELING UNWELL ALONG WITH DIZZINESS AND WEAKNESS  WERE SYMPTOMS OF A POSSIBLE REACTION TO THE VACCINE. SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMS COULD BE FROM A PREVIOUS STROKE.

A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL1284), intramuscularly on the left arm, on 12Jan2021 14:00, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient and his wife went to the local senior citizen center on 12Jan2021 to get the vaccine. After which the patient noticed a slight dizziness on 12Jan2021 which was minimal, and the dizziness was something that was normal for him. The dizziness started within 15 minutes time frame after receiving the vaccine. The dizziness occurred when he stood up to leave on 12Jan2021; now the dizziness has recovered. He stated he had dizziness and it went away and possibly occurred because he got up too quick. He also felt a little woozy on 12Jan2021 and it was under control. The next day, on 13Jan2021, after receiving the vaccine he experienced fever, headache, almost flu-like symptoms, and stiffness of his body. His fever went up to 101, 101.8, 101.9 that night of 13Jan2021; earlier in the afternoon of 13Jan2021 around 15:00, he noticed a weirdness as he had a tightness in his head and then discovered he had a fever. He also had cold sweats, on the night of 13Jan2021, and his clothing was soaked - this occurred on a couple of evenings since then. Furthermore, he noticed in Jan2021 there was a cycle that continued where he did not have high temperature in the morning, his temperature was around 99 after breakfast and then his temperature would go up to 100 or 101 towards the evening.

He also had a covid test that was negative on 21Jan2021. He then added that he also had a negative covid test on 18Jan2021; it was not the rapid test but a test that started with a &#34;p&#34;. With these, his primary care provider was very much concerned, and he had a battery of tests done then he was discovered to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) on 22Jan2021. He informed that his primary care provider asked him to go into the office since the primary care provider was convinced that it was something more than just a reaction to the Pfizer covid vaccine. He had more tests on 22Jan2021 and that was when he was diagnosed with a UTI. It was a minimal UTI, not of any consequence, that when the doctor pushed on his bladder it hurt on 22Jan2021. He then received an intravenous antibiotic in the emergency room for the UTI but confirmed that he was not admitted. He stated that he has never had a reaction to any medication he has taken before. He then asked if he should get the second dose, the &#34;booster&#34; of the covid vaccine. He admitted he was quite reluctant to get the second dose that was scheduled for 02Feb2021 and his primary care provider advised against getting the second dose. The outcome of the event dizziness/woozy and dizziness occurred when he stood up to leave/had dizziness and it went away and possibly occurred because he got up too quick was recovered on 12Jan2021. The outcome of the event fever was recovered on 21Jan2021. The patient was recovering from UTI. The outcome of the events tightness in his head and when the doctor pushed on his bladder it hurt was unknown. The outcome of the events headache, flu-like symptoms, stiffness of his body and, cold sweats was recovered on Jan2021 (duration reported as &#34;-12 day&#34;). All adverse events resulted in an emergency room visit and a physician office visit.

Did get out of bed for that duration except to go to bathroom. Vomiting never returned after first occurrence. On 3-2-2021, 48hours post injection. My right arm from bicep to shoulder was swollen and red, Stiffness also associated with slight rash on pectoral area and under arm.

                                                The morning after receiving second dose, I awoke with a headache, no strength at all and  no bladder control.  It took me forty five minutes to get out of bed after numerous attempts.  I also experience dizziness, balance issues.  In all honesty, it was as if I had gotten Covid all over again.  I had it in late August and all of September.  The second day after the shot, I experienced lack of strength, but not as bad as the first day, and whole body muscle aches.  The third day after,  was about the same and after that, things started getting a  little better.

                                                Swelling, soreness at injection site just after shot. Uneasy sleep, awoke the following morning in a sweat, with overall discomfort and nausea, began to retch and vomit for nearly 13 hrs. throughout the only comfort was to sit in a hot shower till the hot water ran out sometime falling into a deep sleep, I did this many times through the day, Accompanying this was a general fog and complete loss of equilibrium, extreme weakness. this made it difficult to move from bed to bath or anywhere in my home. I am writing this at 5:13 am Mar  6 and find it hard to gather thoughts.

A 73-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Feb2021 (about 9:20AM-9:30AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was vaccinated with the first dose of BNT162B2 on an unspecified date at 73-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had his second COVID-19 Vaccine yesterday, 21Feb2021 and had a significant reaction. Last night (21Feb2021), about 12 hours later, he started getting a headache, he was breathing really fast, and shivering. He tried to calm himself down and went to bed. This morning (22Feb2021) he got up around 7AM and still wasn&#39;t feeling too well. His temperature was slightly elevated at 98.9 on 22Feb2021. His normal temperature is 97.1. He knows his own body and was pretty convinced his reaction was from a slightly elevated temperature and everything that comes with that. He went back to bed this morning and slept until 11:30AM. He got up and felt good. He took his temperature a few minutes ago and it was back to 97.1. The outcome of the events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and safety profile of the product, the contributory role of the suspect product  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203), to reported events cannot totally be excluded.

                                                Purkinje Tree and Covid-19 Vaccine. During the current COVID-19 pandemic and massively increased vaccinations, there have been few ocular side effects reported with the  vaccine. 1) However conjunctivitis has occurred with Covid-19 infection and very rarely endophthalmitis has been reported.  I wish to mention an otherwise unreported association with visualization of a Purkinje Tree and Pfizer Covid-19 second vaccine. I am a 73 year old otherwise healthy retired male. I had an entoptic experience after I received my second vaccine.  With the first vaccine I had no visual side effects.  The afternoon of my second dose I took an hour long  nap, which was unusual for me.  When I woke up and opened my eyes I noticed a bilateral arborizing, interlacing dark pattern that lasted less than a second. This was opaque but without a ghost image and otherwise the wall, sheet,  and ceiling were seen clearly behind that network.   I experimented with opening and shutting either and both eyes looking at a white sheet beneath me, and found that especially with my dominant left eye I saw a pattern resembling my left eye retinal vascular tree.  The branches originated as single vessels  superiorly and inferiorly that branched down to smaller vessels  all on the right side of a disc type structure without duplication into an identifiable arteriolar and  venous system. Even with a light source moving over my left shoulder,  the image never lasted longer than a fraction of a second and fatigued quickly with repetition.  I laid back down and repeated the experiment of opening and shutting either eye while looking at a white ceiling. Then the image changed to a horizontally oriented pattern with two single black vessel type structures coming off a disc type structure.  The dark lines further branched and narrowed as they extended to the right and left off the disc type structure.  Again this lasted less than a second. It faded away rather than floated away. The image always appeared in the same area of my field of vision. It was peri-central when I looked at the wall and inferior to fixation when I looked at the ceiling.   The image would immediately move with eye movement, unlike a vitreous floater. Opening and shutting my left eye could refresh the image very briefly but that fatigued with repetition and could not be reproduced after 3-4 trials or without several hours between attempts. I did  translations of Purkinje?s description of the Tree (described here later.)  and had short term  partial success with his methods, except for pushing on  my eye, and using galvanic current,  which I did not attempt.  I declined a full exam but did  remember a lecture about Purkinje images.  He had the residents hold pen lights to the side of their eyes and move the light back and forth while he  described the Purkinje Tree. Afterwards he quizzed the residents about whether they could see it or not, with the ?humorous? disclaimer that it was a means of IQ testing if they could see it.  Half could.  It was of interest to me that  before I retired,  occasionally patients would mentions seeing the tree after an ophthalmoscopic exam.  I hoped to delight those patients by  telling them it was a form of IQ quiz and they had done well.  Two weeks later I was disappointed that I could no longer see the tree, but again declined an exam.  I am optically conversant, but physically adverse in seeking self care.   Purkinje first described the ?Tree?2) in his doctorate thesis in 1819. It was included in descriptions of other entoptic phenomena, performed mostly on himself. This was before the ophthalmoscope was discovered and before quality histological, serial sections were available.  He described holding a candle or using galvanic illumination in front of his eyes individually and moving it around.  He could see  black lines in a network that came off a central pit structure.  There were two lines inferiorly and superiorly with adjacent shadows and ultimately had size reducing branches.  He recognized these branching lines as retinal blood vessels, but could not discern any blood flow.  In 1825 he published a further volume 3) that dealt with experiments he subsequently had performed.  He found that by holding a sheet of paper with a hole in it that he moved around,  he could get a better view of the blood vessel pattern.  He could discern the macula and described anastomosing blood vessels superior to inferior.  A significant improvement in his discerning the blood vessel pattern was obtained with a safe amount of pressure on the superior lateral aspect of the eye.  With this he could recognized blood corpuscles and flow patterns and then labeled the lines as veins. He did not describe arteriole patterns.  So this leaves us with the question why this sudden awareness of the Purkinje Tree appeared in the time frame of a second Covid-19 vaccine.  This will require further reports to determine coincidence versus cause-effect.  This is a high stress time with Covid-19 deaths so prevalent. I had immediate relief after my second shot with a reduction of tension and increase in awareness of my general physical status as in the feeling of being hot or cold, sleepy or just fatigued, improved calmness, and the pertinent Purkinje Tree.  At sign in for the second series of Pfizer injections the RN on duty asked about side effects from the first shot.  She asked us to send a report in of any potential side effect then of the second shot and notified us that people were having more problems with the second shot than the first. Arm soreness, swelling, fever, chills, headache,  malaise, fatigue.  She gave us a print out list of known side effects, mostly systemic and all mild, but nothing ophthalmic.  With these things  in mind I was especially vigilant of any thing new in my general health or condition.  Most of the patients getting the shots were students and the congregating area was in a wing of a hospital.  This brought back the pleasant memory of my time in training and  my chief?s description of Purkinje?s Tree and perhaps enhanced the  brief ability to see the entoptic image.  In between times playing with this image my vision was normal and  my general health remained good, without symptoms of vascular compromise.

Had no control of body functions and urinated all over myself. Could not get strength to get off the toilet. Needed help with that and back to bed. Fell on the way there. Wife was able to help me crawl back to bed. A few hours later had to urinate again, but could not get out of bed. No control no strength. Was half on the toilet and could not get myself straight on due to literally no body strength. Fell off the toilet, could not move at all. Had to call my son over to get me up. I was sick all day long. Later in the day I was able to get up a bit and walk but not steadily. Tylenol helped. Later that night I was feeling better. By the next day I was pretty well back to mysllf

Patient was waiting in observation area for 30 mins post the vaccine.  About 10 mins post vaccination patient felt sick to his stomach and spit up into his mask.  He called pharmacy staff over and we gave garbage pale to spit up into.  He spit up approximately 10ml of orange phlegm and that was all.  He asked for water to rinse his mouth so staff gave him a little bit of water to rinse with.  Pharmacist stayed with patient and monitored him for additional adverse effects.  Pharmacist took patient&#39;s blood pressure which was 174/98 at 3:21pm 14 mins post vaccination and a second time 19mins post vaccination at 3:26pm it was 150/90.  Patient reported having history of acid reflux and he had just had orange juice and Jax (cheetos) so he believed it was due to what he ate.  We continued to monitor patient.  He stated he was feeling fine and wanted to leave.  Pharmacist asked to recheck his BP at which he declined saying he was feeling fine and the 150/90 is normal for him.  The pharmacist help to escort the patient to the front registers to make sure he was not experiencing anything else and at that time patient stated he felt fine and was leaving the store.

                                                I got my 1st Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination on 3/4/2021. No real adverse effects immediately - just a little sore right arm at the injection site and a watery, runny nose a day or so later that eventually stopped. I have allergies so I&#39;m used to the runny nose symptom. However, on Monday evening, March 15, I noticed some slight pain where my lymph nodes are located underneath my jaw and close to my ear on the right side. There was a small lump that was tender to the touch, about the size of a small raisin or grape, under my jaw along my neck on the right side. To a much lesser extent, and barely noticeable, in a similar location, on my left side as well. I went to my primary care physician the next day, 3/16, who confirmed that I had swollen lymph nodes - and also told me they could notice them further down my neck as well, which I was not aware of previously. I had no other symptoms, e.g., no temperature, etc. They said that, yes, the swollen lymph nodes appeared to be consistent with earlier reports of swollen lymph nodes as a resulting side effect in some patients following a Covid19 vaccination, but also mentioned that often, this side effect was more noticeable several days after the vaccination. Since my swollen lymph nodes occurred nearly 10 days later, my PCP team said to go ahead and get the 2nd Pfizer vaccination as scheduled 3/25/21, but to return to their office two weeks later for another checkup to make sure there weren&#39;t any other issues going on.

A 73-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 17Feb2021 03:00 (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2008 and ongoing and reported that it&#39;s under control. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient was calling because he got his shot through the (facility name withheld) on the 17Feb2021 around 3:00. The caller goes for walks, and one week later he had a blackout, about the same time he got the shot 3:00 or 3:15 on 24Feb2021. The caller blacked out and he broke his glasses, scraped his face, all that stuff. All the scrapes were healing. The weirdest thing was it happened almost exactly a week later. The caller asked was it possible that this could be related to the vaccine. For the following two days after the vaccine the caller had 2 light headaches on 18Feb2021 and then they were gone on 19Feb2021. This blackout event happened one time. Caller mentioned the headaches were nothing to be concerned about. The caller was not given a vaccination card at the (facility name withheld) and does not know the lot number, NDC number, or expiration date. This was the caller&#39;s first dose of the vaccine. The caller mentioned that 11Mar2021 was his next appointment for the second dose of the vaccine. The caller has never had a black out episode or dizziness before. The caller said he licked his wounds and will be okay. No visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office required. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No relevant tests done. The outcome was recovered on 19Feb2021 for the event Headache; and recovering for the other events.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

When his PCP got those results, he was instructed to go to the ED immediately, where he was admitted for pneumonia. PCP told patient that pneumonia was caused by covid vaccine and has instructed patient to not get second dose.

A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6204), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 04Mar2021 11:15 (at the age of 73-years-old), at 0.3 mL (30 mcg), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: service connected disability diagnosed from the (name withheld) for a lower back injury; last Spring and early Summer (2020) he went through treatment for 45 days with External beam radiation therapy (EBRT), which was 405 doses of radiation from a machine called FORD, had radiation treatment for early stage prostate cancer last year (2020);  had anaphylactic shock, rash, awful case of hives when in military service in response to shots then and stayed for half an hour until okay (The patient was unable to provide names of vaccines given in past in service since that was in 1969-1970&#39;s. At that time, they got the shots in big air guns and was shot 3-4 at a time. Had those 3-4 shots during his basic training. During that time, he woke up around midnight and had awful case of hives and was taken to the base hospital and was given adrenaline in one arm and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) in the other); allergies to sulfa drugs; diagnosed allergies (unspecified); compromised immune status; respiratory illness; genetic/chromosomal abnormalities; endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity); blood stools, rare occasion; glasses. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination or on the same day as the vaccination. The patient received the first dose on 04Mar2021 at about 11:15. He had not had much of a reaction, just a little soreness and soreness (04Mar2021). The soreness started that afternoon of getting the vaccine. When he went to sleep, he noticed the soreness was in right arm, so he didn&#39;t lay on that side. He noticed it enough to sleep on the other side. On 07Mar2021, the patient had bloody stools, which were a rare occasion in the past. The patient stated the blood was significant enough to draw his attention, almost felt like a blockage in the system. The patient &#34;sat on the pot&#34; for 15-20 minutes and broke into a sweat (07Mar2021). The patient did not know if he had bloody stool then, because he didn&#39;t turn on the light, but ever since then, it has been bloody. No BM&#39;s (bowel movement) since yesterday (09Mar2021). The patient was tired yesterday (09Mar2021). He just laid around all day on a heating pad. He had a dull ache in stomach since it started (07Mar2021). Still there today, but not that bad. The patient stated he had radiation treatment for early stage prostate cancer, they tried to prevent burning or damaging the rectum, but this could be related to that. On Sunday night (07Mar2021), about midnight, he got an awful, awful stomach pain that woke him up about midnight. He tried to move his bowels 2-3 times Sunday night (07Mar2021) and on Monday morning (08Mar2021) he was able to move them a little bit. His underwear he had from Sunday night had lots of red stains in them, and all day Monday (08Mar2021) he was having a bellyache. Every time he managed to move his bowels and it was bloody and seemed to get bloodier pretty much all day. Yesterday (09Mar2021), he laid on a heating pad and went to bed early about 20:30, he usually goes about 22:00. He managed to stay in bed for about 9 hours, and he usually can&#39;t sleep that long. He slept on his side. He started having dark thoughts (unspecified date Mar2021), stating that last Spring and early Summer he went through treatment for 45 days with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). On Monday night (08Mar2021), the patient had terrible cramps about midnight, with very cold sweat and diarrhea. The next morning (09Mar2021), every bowel movement was very bloody. Then all day Tuesday (09Mar2021) very lethargic. No more bowel movements until the following Friday. The patient stated he felt like I was trying to pass a blood clot. The patient stated he seemed to have problems with bowels all day yesterday (09Mar2021) and was not much better; he had really low energy (09Mar2021). Today (10Mar2021), he seemed to feel better, but not much. He had not eaten much (Mar2021) and was hesitant to put food in his system, since his system was not functioning very well. The patient had not been seen by doctor or in an emergency room. His wife was a retired nurse, and they have discussed if he was not better, they were going to call his primary care provider and urologist. The patient had coffee this morning (10Mar2021), and he barely touched it yesterday morning. So far, no bloody discharge, no discharge or bowel movements today. Three to four times in the night he did pass gas (Mar2021), and that was all that happened. The patient knew side effects were rare with this (vaccine) and unsure if these side effects were something reported; this was certainly unusual for him. The clinical outcome of bloody stools, dull ache in stomach, had really low energy, terrible cramps, very cold sweat, diarrhea, tired, and lethargic was recovering. The outcome of belly ache, decreased appetite, and gas, was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot and expiry were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 03Mar2021 14:55 (at the age of 73 -years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccination facility type was a clinic and the vaccine was not administered at a military facility. There were no vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient had no medical history, no family history and no concomitant medications. The patient got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 03Mar2021, states it went well for a couple of days and on the 3rd day (06Mar2021) his thighs really ached really bad, that lasted 2 days and cleared up. On Saturday night (13Mar2021) he went to his grandsons soccer game, all of a sudden it was like his body heated up, from stomach to brain and could not see anything, vision was gray and black, and then legs started to give out. The episode lasted about 15 minutes, he did not pass out, the same thing happened again yesterday. The patient talked to the family physician and heart doctor office, they told him to call and report the event. The events did not require emergency room visit. The outcome was recovered on 08Mar2021 for pain in extremity and on 14Mar2021 for diplegia, body temperature increased and chromatopsia.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                My uncle died three days after taking the vaccine; he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat; he felt like he wasn&#39;t doing well; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting for her uncle.    A 73-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included psoriasis , cardiac pacemaker insertion on an unknown date (He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago) , hypertension from an unknown date.      The patient  died three days after taking the vaccine  on 09Apr2021 , he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 150/90   on  09Apr2021.    It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  Course of the event: The reporter&#39;s uncle died three days after taking the vaccine. He was at home getting ready to watch a basketball game with the reporter&#39;s aunt when he began to complain that he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat. Both the patient and the reporter&#39;s aunt are also RN&#39;s. My aunt checked his BP and the first time it was 150/90. His BP was taken a second time but the reporter cannot remember what  the 2nd reading was. He then said he was going to the bathroom and asked her to call # because he felt like he wasn&#39;t doing well.  The reporter&#39;s aunt  called #, and assisted the reporter&#39;s uncle to lay down in bed. She remained on the phone with #who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. They performed CPR at the scene and he was transported to the hospital. The reporter  believes the patient was pronounced dead at home. The patient was about 5&#34;10, heavy set stature. He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago and has a history of psoriasis and HTN. There is additional concomitant medical history I will have to confirm.   Information about lot/batch has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment for the reported patient&#39;s sudden death. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), dose 1 intramuscular on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 vaccination; adalimumab (HUMIRA), subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1132646) to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose, subcutaneous from an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: 1136949) to Mar2021, at unspecified dose for moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.  The patient medical history includes ear infection. Concomitant medications were not reported. On unknown dates, the patient experienced tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles and whole left side of face and eye swollen. In 2021, the patient experienced infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy and whole left side of face and eye swollen. On 02Mar2021, the patient experienced felt weakness and chills. On 08Apr2021, the patient experienced substantial bubble of pus under arm. On 10Apr2021, the patient experienced thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit. In Apr2021, the substantial bubble of pus under arm resolved. On unknown dates, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears and whole left side of face and eye swollen resolved. Covid-19 vaccine was also considered suspect. In Feb2021, the patient saw his physician twice for an ear infection. On 01Mar2021, the patient got his first vaccine shot. The next day he had chills and fever and feeling of weakness the next day. He went away after a short time and he felts better. He went to the physician twice in the past two weeks for minor infections especially in his ears. The tissue inside his ear dried up and bleeding. On the first visit he had a fever due to the infection in the ear. His physician prescribed antibiotic for a week. He got another infection in the same ears. He was painful when touched it. He went back to physician and physician prescribed another anitbiotic. The physician said the infections were to be expected with Humira because Humira weakens immune system. Partly because of his age. His age may be a contributing factor as well. He agrees to have physician contacted. On 29Mar2021 to 1Apr2021, he was in the hospital his infection started in his ear lobe that migrated to his whole left side of his face. His eye was swollen and felt pain on top of his head. His Temp of 105 when he went in. The patient was given intravenous antibiotics. He was tested to make sure infection had not spread to blood or bones. The Humira might have played a role because it lowers the bodies resistance to infection. They asked him not to take the Humira for two Saturdays. He did not take Humira on 09Apr2021 or before. He was stable. His skin was cracking up. Thought it might be shingles. He was prescribed an oral antibiotic first time, but then a week and a half later, it acted up again and he went back and got a different antibiotic and that worked until it. He was feeling completely better since he got out of the hospital. He had more energy than he had in a while. He had been feeling low energy for a while due to the infection. His physician did not think he should stop taking Humira but if he got a fever he needs to investigate immediately to see if he needs to hospitalized. In 08Apr2021, he had substantial bubble of puss under his arm. He gave him a steroid injection to control that. On 10Apr2021, he had thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of his armpit and he thinks that was the end of it. On 11Apr2021, he had his second Covid vaccine manufactured by Moderna then after he was released from the hospital. He was no issues or reactions with either injection. He was careful when he went out around people. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. The action taken in response to the events adalimumab was not applicable. The outcome of event infection in ear lobe, eye swelling and swelling face recovered in 2021, weakness and chills and fever recovered in Mar2021, ear infection and pain localised recovered on unspecified date, Axillary abscess/substantial bubble of puss under arm recovered in Apr2021; event ear bleeding was recovering; event fluid discharge, skin fissures and shingles was unknown.  The reporter&#39;s causality for adalimumab (Humira) on the events infection in ear lobe, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, minor infections in ears, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset with Humira (Adalimumab) was a reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of felt weakness and chills with Humira (Adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, skin was cracking up and possible shingles was not provided.  Opinion is that there is a reasonable possibility that the events of infection in ear lobe, feeling low energy, thick white odorous liquid almost syrup came pouring out of armpit, second infection in ears/painful when touched, felt pain on top of head, skin was cracking up, minor infections in ears, possible shingles, substantial bubble of puss under arm, whole left side of face and eye swollen onset in 2021 and whole left side of face and eye swollen unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab). Opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of felt weakness, chills, tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset and tissue inside ear dried up and had bleeding unknown onset are related to humira(adalimumab).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Pfizer comment: The serious events Ear lobe infection and Condition aggravated were considered as unlikely related to Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. A possible contributory role of BNT162b2 cannot be completely excluded for the non-serious asthenia, pyrexia and chills, which occurred in a close temporal relation, namely, one day after the  first dose BNT162B2 injection. The other reported events were confirmed as non-serious, while the causality was confounded by ADALIMUMAB administration. The infectious events were to be expected with co-suspect due an immunosuppression activity with increased infection susceptibility, such as Herpes zoster and Ear lobe infection aggravated, in this case. Furthermore, swelling face and eye swollen with unknown onset in 2021 may be attributable to the co-suspect and unrelated to the vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

Never had a fever. All of a sudden, around 2:30PM all dissipated, it was all gone and I was fine. A week later I called my PCP because the symptoms came back - the lethargy. He suggested me to go to the ER. I went and could barely write my name on the sign in sheet at the hospital. They did 5 COVID tests and 4 of them were negative. I was at the ER for 3 days and finally was admitted and stayed for 11 days.  I was sent home with oxygen and my levels are finally getting back to 92/93.  I can&#39;t walk at this time. I lost 17 lbs and if I try to walk my lungs shut down.

Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 15Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from two contactable consumers (patient&#39;s wife and patient) via a Pfizer-sponsored program, Pfizer First Connect. This consumer (patient&#39;s wife) reported similar events for two patients. This is the second of two reports.    A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EH9899, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a clinic. Medical history included prostate cancer, off rapid radiation (over two years ago by robotic surgery. He followed all the recommendations for rapid off radiation, no side effects. He took hormone therapy. He is cured), acid reflux, allergies (takes antihistamine when allergies act up; his allergies blossomed because of the leaves), and he used to be five nine, but he shrunk a little. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), losartan, pantoprazole for he had a bout with acid reflux, and tadalafil.  The patient&#39;s wife and the patient both received the COVID-19 vaccine on 04Jan2021 and stated they have a mild case; they did not have any severe symptoms of the COVID and did not have a fever. The patient&#39;s oxygen level was normal. The patient&#39;s wife confirmed that she and her husband both had the vaccine on the same day and they both have COVID. The patient got a cough and was going to go the (clinic name). They went there and had lungs checked. Their lungs were clear and oxygen level was good. They both have been tested a few times. The patient&#39;s wife and the husband quarantined for two weeks and test were negative. When they were there this past Monday, they were asked if they wanted to be tested. They both got the results on Wednesday and were shocked; they were now quarantining again. COVID testing was done on 11Jan2021 and got the positive results on 13Jan2021. The patient&#39;s wife and the husband gave them a card, for when to come back. It was given at a drive through clinic in (county name). The patient feels fine and is sleeping well.  The patient recovered from the event in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021045610 same reporter/drug, similar events in different patients

Yesterday, February 2nd, in  the late afternoon I became very red and itchy and my tongue swelled. I went to  the emergency room where they gave me sodium chloride, Benadryl,  Pepcid and 2 &#34;epi&#34; shots. After about 4 hours I was sent home. Could that have  been a reaction to my Covid vaccine? Today I am tired but fine and swelling is  gone. I had told the person who scheduled my first shot and the person who  vaccinated me that I was taking Skyrizi injections for psoriasis and had my  last injection of Skyrizi on Dec 15.&#34;

                                                headaches get worse at night; headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration on left upper arm on 16Jan2021 14:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included anticoagulant therapy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included rivaroxaban (XARELTO). The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 16Jan2021. He has had a headache that has come and gone and after taking over the counter medication they seem to have eased up a little. Saturday night was pretty bad and Sunday night he took Excedrin before he went to sleep and when he woke up he took another half and that seemed to keep it at bay. He took two halves today and it seems to be holding the headache back. He stated it feels more like an allergy headache, the left side of his temple by his left eye is where it radiates from. He asked if other people got headaches and how long do the headaches typically last and will they eventually go away. He reported his headaches were getting lighter, but the headaches get worse at night. The patient also stated when they give the shot they don&#39;t discuss the side effects. He said they give you a sheet that lists the side effects but he stated that 25% of people having headaches is pretty significant and this should be highlighted on the sheet. He said he took 1/2 of an Equate Headache Relief caplet, and then took another 1/2 of the Equate Headache Relief caplet later. He said he tried regular Tylenol (clarified as Equate brand Acetaminophen 500mg), and the Equate Acetaminophen 500mg didn&#39;t do anything for his headache. He stated he didn&#39;t have the Equate Acetaminophen 500mg box, any longer. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headache (headache). The outcome of the event headache was recovering while the event headaches get worse at night was unknown.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021), via unspecified route of administration on left arm on 22Jan2021 at 08:15 AM at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The relevant medical history included three stents in his heart, allergy and medication for cholesterol (he just quit the medication, it was killing his legs). They have tried him on them 99 times but he cannot take statin drugs, they cripple him. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient previously took Claritin (doesn&#39;t know if he took this for food or medication allergies, he thought it was for sinus drainage most of it). The patient said he got his COVID shot and had a fever of 102 and he had chills with it too on 22Jan2021. He said he was wondering what he was supposed to do to get that fever down, which he clarified it was 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The fever started by the time he got back, it was a 2.5-3 hours drive, his wife checked his temperature about 5 minutes prior for the first time, because his face was burning up. He says that the NDC is not written on the vaccine card with the other handwritten information, it did say he went back 12Feb for the second one. He had not started any new medications or received any recent vaccinations. The patient underwent lab test included temperature elevation which showed 102.4 degrees Fahrenheiton on 22Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Note:  Shot was administered at Clinic . not Dr. office.  Beginning on the evening of 1/29/21 I began experiencing Chills, a slight fever of 100.3 and extreme fatigue. These conditions continued for a period of 3 days.  At that point I also began to experience shortness of breath and my O2 level dropped to 78%.  I began using a nebulizer, spirometer,  flutter valve and exercises at that point and over the next several days.  Please note that I am a COPD patient and had completed a 16 day course of Prednisone on 1/25/21.  On approximately 2/6/21 my breathing and O2 levels began to return towards normal, although even today I&#39;m still not quite back to what&#39;s normal for me.  I am continuing to use the nebulizer, spirometer and flutter value in preparation for shot #2 scheduled for 2/18/21.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office.

An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued.

The consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot no. E10142, via an unspecified route of administration (administered to the left arm) on 19Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for Covid vaccination administered at facility. Medical history included 100% disabled, Covid from Jul2020, hospitalized from 21Jul2020 to 26Jul2020, blood plasma, and sore. No relevant family medical history relevant to AEs. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient previously took remdesivir. The patient called to report side effects after getting the first Pfizer COVID vaccination. He got it on 19Jan2021. He had COVID before. Last summer he hadn&#39;t left the house for 20 plus weeks and their son who was living with them brought the COVID virus in to them. His son and wife were asymptomatic and suffered at the house and he was completely disabled, with underlying conditions had to drag himself to the facility. He eventually had to be hospitalized on 21Jul2020. He had blood plasma and remdesivir and stayed in the hospital from Tuesday through Sunday. After getting the treatment, he felt like superman. On 20Jan2021, he next day, about 24 hours later he started feeling sick again, he felt like when he had COVID back in Jul2020. It lasted for 24 hours, terrible headache, chills, aches, and a little diarrhea. He said after he got the vaccine, 24 hours later, his arm got sorer and sorer. He had 99.9 F fever and a terrible headache. He also put on a little weight on an unspecified date. No emergency room visit. No relevant tests. He called the facility the next morning and they told him to rest. He slept all day and the next day he felt like superman again. He called the facility that Thursday morning and they instructed him to relax and that it seemed to affect people who have had the COVID virus before, they have that reaction, and it should subside and it did. He stated his side effects were about 20% of what they were when he actually had COVID. The clinic told him that if he had any reaction to call and that Thursday he just relaxed. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. Never had any problems with shots, not really. He remembered when he went to specific area they gave him a whole bunch of shots with these guns and he was just sore a couple days, but that was it, no big deal.

Then less frequently (bigger intervals - maybe 4 times) till about 5am 3/6/21.  Then it more or less stopped.  Headache left, and though the stomach was worked over, I was now feeling better. Other than a rough night. All this time I had been rehydrating  frequently - trying to keep pace with discharge . . . (fizzy water - no additives) sometimes cut with a very little cranberry juice.  Since then  BRAT and now back to almost normal.   4lb lighter . . . That&#39;s good.

My shoulder where the shot occurred became painful and a pinkish rash formed there.  The temp rose to 3.5 degrees over the next seven hours and remained that high until mid morning Saturday.

The rash disappeared on Monday and the shoulder pain stopped on Tuesday.

Developed pain in my abdomen area quite noticeable 4 days later.  6 days later had major pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea.  Went to ER morning of the 7th day....spent 4 days in hospital.  Had a blood clot--Portal Vein Thrombosis.  Put on Heparin drip in hospital...and Eliquis blood thinners after released.  I have never been sick like that...never been on any prescription...always been healthy, walking 3-5 miles per day.   My family feels that there must be a connection with the vaccine.  One of my doctors said no...another said didn&#39;t think so, but unknown at this time.

                                                First episode 2/21 [26 hours after 2nd shot].  Dull Chest pain.  Took 2 Tylenol and it went away.  Eleven days later,  chest pain returns but pain radiates up back into neck and head.  Took 2 Tylenol and went to bed.   Pain subsides.  Next 3 days pain repeats from chest to  head.  Fourth day I start to shiver internally.  This lasted about 75 minutes before going away..  Next day went to ER.  All ER tests were negative and was released.  Went to cardiologist and had a stress test and several other tests that were all normal.   A week later, I thought I was having a heart attack and went back to ER.  All tests were negative again.  Still wake up with neck pain  alleviated with Tylenol..

This 74-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered on the arm left on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;maybe I don&#39;t know 6198, it&#39;s GN or EN&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, broken back, breathing problem because of his heart and lung, his lungs have problem, he had some nodules in it, and kidney stone once 25 years ago, 5 little stones. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had a reaction, it is the worst reaction he has ever had in his life, the pain he had, he was almost paralyzed and couldn&#39;t walk after vaccine and he had to get a wheelchair because he couldn&#39;t stand on his feet. He ended up in the emergency room. The vaccine put him out of work, and now he can work some. He is trying to make it up in two days, today and tomorrow to finish up. He was very upset and wanted to know why this happened to him. The patient stated that other people he talked to had no reaction, if they had a fever or anything it was gone in a coupled days, but he ended up in the emergency room. On 01Mar2021, patient had his first dose and at 02:30, he got out of the facility and came out okay with no problem. At 21:00, all of a sudden he saw that he could not stand up on his feet and he fell awake. He waited in the bed, people around him got worried. Eventually, he asked them to bring wheelchair, maybe he can drive. He drove home with his wife to the emergency from his house and he got admitted in emergency and he was screaming so bad, he did not believe in his life, he never heard somebody doing like this. He felt like somebody getting chills like somebody cutting his side, on his lower abdomen on the right side. It&#39;s underside of the lower abdomen, he had slight pain every single day, sometime excruciating, he took Ibuprofen for it. He thought he had a kidney stone because he had it once 25 years ago, 5 little stones, so they took him to emergency, took him to the CT scan. They didn&#39;t find anything, but the pain was excruciating and in the emergency room everybody thought the crazy man is here who is screaming. He couldn&#39;t control his scream. He couldn&#39;t walk, he couldn&#39;t move. Every movement was like you put a knife on the cutting, it was that bad. His second dose was due on 22Mar2021. He went to the pharmacy and asked them the number and let them know that he had a reaction like this and they called somebody and said to cancel the shot. They cancelled it. That day for 3 days, patient had the pain, it was slowly because he had to take eventually oxycodone. The doctor advised in the emergency room that nothing was wrong, just to slow down the pain but he was not allowed to take the oxycodone. He took the 10 mg oxycodone and the pain which was an hour and a half was a little bit down. After 3 hours, it was a little better, he didn&#39;t want to scream, it was gone but the pain was still there for at least 3 days, really bad. He was taking ibuprofen and a muscle relaxant. He did all those things and still I have the pain left and he did not know what to do with that. The lab test he had, he had been okay, he did not have any problem. He got the result on 22Mar2021. Outcome of the events pain and abdominal pain was not recovered and of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

If they move in his line of sight, he can still see through them. He did not take second shot. He was scared to because he would get more floaters. It has been 3 weeks already and he still has floaters and it has not changed. Second shot was scheduled for 19Mar2021. Two weeks after first and a week before second one, he decided he did not want to get second shot. Fatigue got better 7 days after. Taste and smell took longer to return but came back since then.

A contactable consumer reported that a 74-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162b2(COMIRNATY, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6207, Expiration: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 19Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history includes Arthritis (arthritis is in his right foot only and his big toe, diagnosed in 2017 or 2018) and Concomitant medication were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY) on 26Feb2021 for Covid-19 immunisation and Unspecified steroid shot. Stated reaction was three to four days. First shot got caller and patient down for a week. Second shot got caller down for three days. At first, patient&#39;s reaction was running like hers. Patient had a dry cough on an unspecified date in 2021. Was going for a COVID test today. Last week patient started running a fever on an unspecified date in 2021 and his legs were extremely weak on 14Apr2021. Has to hold onto something to go through the house on 14Apr2021. He was moving a little better, but not much. Patient had to go to doctor for his foot. Has terrible arthritis in the big toe on his right foot. Gets steroid shot every three months. Three weeks and four days after second COVID shot everything seemed to have worn off. The PA put the shot in his foot and it bruised the patient. Patient still has bruises on an unspecified date in 2021. Got the steroid shot in his big toe and two days later the weakness hit a second time. It really wiped him out. Caller cannot help patient get up and down. Patient was struggling with his legs and was aching. Wants to know if a steroid shot on top of the COVID shot and that close after would cause another reaction? The PA said it was ok to get a steroid shot three weeks after. Patient started having these reactions and doesn&#39;t know if it was the COVID shot. Has had steroid shots every 3 months for 4 years. Has never had this kind of reaction. Patient didn&#39;t think about getting the steroid shot because he seemed to be feeling fine. Reaction started the next morning and it was even worse on an unspecified date in 2021. By the third day after the shot he was down and caller couldn&#39;t help patient get up. It scared the caller. Patient also broke out in a rash across his shoulders and down both arms. States her husband has had both shots and he has been having issues since the second one n 19MAR2021. Reporter states 3 weeks and 4 days after the second vaccine, her husband had to have a steroid shot in his foot because he has terrible arthritis in his right foot. Reporter states the patient has had a flare up since then with weakness in his legs and a rash on his chest. States the only difference this time is that he had just had the second Covid vaccine 3 weeks prior. States he has not had steroid reactions in the past, and she feels like this reaction was because of the Covid vaccine. Clarifies the shot in his foot was on 13Apr2021 and she does not know what steroid was injected. States it was 3weeks and 4 days between the steroid injection and the vaccine. States maybe they should war people not to get a steroid shot for a longer time after the vaccine. States after the first vaccine for about 5 days they were just laid out. States they ate soup and whatever they could warm up in the microwave. States his ear doctor said if they reacted to the first shot they must have had Covid at sometimes. States she doesn&#39;t know, they never got tested before but they didn&#39;t have any symptoms. States her husband&#39;s test yesterday was negative. Weakness in the Legs AE: States for the last 2 days, he could not even get up on his own and she can&#39;t lift him because he was bigger than she was. Rash was states it was not itching or anything, just a rash. States it was odd because she has had hives, and this was just broken out. Clarifies the rash was across his upper back, chest, and down both arms on 14Apr2021. States it was kind of like speckled on his body like the measles on an unspecified date in 2021. States the patient was 74 years old and he had measles when he was a kid just like she did, so it is not the measles. States the patient had a Covid 19 test done yesterday and it came back negative, so he doesn&#39;t have Covid. She doesn&#39;t know what it was. Treatment: states he was taking Motrin for the Aching. States she does not know if the reaction was because the PA did the injection, it had always been the doctor that had given the injection. Caller states she thinks it was getting the steroid injection on top of receiving the Covid shot. States the both received their vaccines because they couldn&#39;t get a shot because they weren&#39;t giving shots at her age, so when offered them the vaccine, they jumped on it. Yes, last Monday to his Nurse Practitioner, did not address the weakness in his legs because did not know what to do for that. She did not even say what she thought it was, said he needed to see someone about that but does not know who to see, does not know whether to go to the ER or who to go to. Not that emergent but when doctor does not know what to treat with worrisome. She was calling about to finish the report and to speak with the Medical department regarding if this has been reported before or if any information on the Covid vaccine and steroid injections. He received the 1st dose on 26Feb2021 and the 2nd dose on 19Mar2021. She mentioned that both of them experienced achiness, sore all over after the 1st dose and flu-like symptoms on an unspecified date in 2021 after both doses. Her husband however, had muscle weakness on his legs after the 2nd dose. On 13Apr2021, about 3 weeks and 4 days after the 2nd dose, her husband received a steroid shot on his right foot. They noticed that the weakness on his legs became extreme, to which he had trouble standing up and has to hold on to something to stand up as he cannot support himself. He also had a rash on his trunk, back, and down his arms. She mentioned that the rash was not itchy but was speckled like measles. They were wondering if this has been reported and if it was possibly an interaction between the vaccine and steroid. They mentioned that they already consulted with their HCP but said that they really cannot tell. Outcome of his legs were extremely weak, has to hold onto something to go through the house was not recovered while with other event rash is across his upper back, chest, and down both arms, Achy all over was recovered on 22Mar2021 and flu-like symptoms after both doses and Sore all Over was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021, while with other events was unknown.  Follow up attempts were needed. Further information is expected.

Unclear whether or not he suffered chronic migraines, although there was paperwork at the death scene stating that he had an appointment for a MRI on 3/1/21.  No recent influenza-like symptoms are reported.  He was found dead in his home on 2/22/21, seated at a chair at his desk.    Autopsy findings include an enlarged and dilated heart, granular kidneys, with the right kidney very shrunken and about half the size of the left kidney, and prostate hypertrophy.  There is no trauma.  The airway is not edematous.    Ancillary studies that are pending include microscopy, toxicology (basic testing plus vitreous chemistries), a COVID swab, a respiratory viral panel swab, HIV testing, and neuropathology.  The cause and manner of death on the death certificate will both be ?pending further studies? until these studies are completed.

This 74-year-old male consumer (patient) reported that he received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration into the right arm on 18Jan2021 (at the age of 74-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included ongoing overweight, blood pressure, thyroid and diabetes. On an unspecified date, COVID 19 virus test was positive. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that he came down with the Covid-19 virus on 01Feb2021 and tested positive for the Covid 19 virus on 03Feb2021 with the swab in his nose and he received his positive results in the afternoon on 04Feb2021. He started having symptoms on 01Feb2021. He had a cough, headache, sinus issues and tiredness. He had no fever. His symptoms only lasted until about 05Feb2021, except for the tiredness. He was tired and weak for about 6 weeks. The caller received his second Covid 19 vaccine in the right arm on 19Feb2021. The needle did not hurt for his second vaccine but the injection part hurt for a good 24 to 36 hours. He meant it hurt, just at the injection site and he did not feel the needle, but he felt pressure at the injection site and it started hurting immediately. That night, 19Feb2021, he had a little fever and he started coughing again and he had a headache. He remembers because he got up in the middle of the night. The next morning, 20Feb2021, the fever, coughing and headache were gone. Only his injection site was bothering him. He takes medicines but does not think his medications are relevant. He has routine blood work done every 6 months and his doctor told him he was healthy. He reported he does not exercise and both he and his wife were tested for the Covid 19 virus at a 360 degree mini-hospital. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) and no vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No following prior vaccinations. The reporter called for his wife who had a history of cancer. She received her first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine on 18Jan2021. Then she and the reporter both tested positive for the Covid 19 virus. He got his second Covid 19 vaccine. His wife was not able to get her second dose and enquired when will she be able to get her second vaccine. She was hospitalized and was still following up with her doctors getting chest x-rays because her doctor said the Covid 19 virus was still in her system even though she was not having any symptoms. Before she got her second Covid 19 vaccine, both tested positive for the Covid 19 virus. She was worse than he was and was not admitted to the hospital, she went to the hospital at the advice of her lung doctor to receive an infusion and was only at the hospital for 3 hours getting the infusion. At that point she had to wait 90 days to receive her second Covid 19 vaccine. If she had no symptoms, she would be able to get it. Her 90 day time frame was up yesterday, 05May2021 and she received her second Covid 19 vaccine yesterday. He reports the CDC and her lung doctor and primary care doctor all had different answers when it came to deciding when she could receive her second vaccine. Her doctors have said she still had the Covid 19 virus and had been treated with steroids and inhalers and had chest x-rays. She feels like she has a lot of weight on her chest and she was coughing constantly. There was some confusion if having to wait more than 42 days between Covid 19 vaccines will require a third vaccine. This report is not related to a study or programme. Investigation Assessment was reported as yes. Outcome was recovered for events cough, headache, sinus issues on 05Feb2021. Outcome was unknown for events drug ineffective, Covid-19, tiredness and weak.  Follow up attempts are needed, further information has been requested.

He has no additional symptoms and stated he just wanted to let someone know. He has not taken anything for his symptoms and was unsure if he could or should. He has been directed to take Tylenol and if symptoms persist to F/U with his PCP and keep me informed. He has been given VAERs website for adverse reactions in the future. I have explained that his headache could be a side effect of the vaccine; however, if his symptoms worsen to seek additional medical evaluation.

He was taking small steps and could barely walk and control his movements.  I held on to him as he tried to get to the bathroom.  All evening he had trouble walking and was unable to control his urination.  He could not hold it and peed down his pant legs.  This incontinence continued all evening and into the night.  He got up three times to use the bathroom that night while sleeping and could not hold his urination.  The next morning these reactions passed and he was able to walk and urinate normally.  He experienced fatigue over the next few days.  I would say he felt normal by Friday of that week.

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

It was stated, &#34;He has three stents in his arteries&#34;. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), metoprolol (METOPROLOL) and rosuvastatin (ROSUVASTATIN). The patient received first dose of COVID vaccine BNT162B2 at the age of 75 years on Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;My husband and I, both got our second shot of Pfizer COVID Vaccine yesterday. Just late this afternoon (02Feb2021), he had a fever of 101.5 which has come down now because he took some Tylenol, had a stomach upset and chills and a little bit of body aches and headaches. Is this the normal reaction that has been with the Pfizer Vaccine?&#34; It was stated, &#34;I think he is feeling a lot better. He took two Tylenol and his fever has gone down to 98.7.&#34; It was further stated, &#34;I have a sore arm and it is much better today but it is still just little tender that is the only thing I had. His arm was pretty sore yesterday as well.&#34; The wife stated, &#34;Yesterday, just shortly after we both got the shot. We both had sore arms by the time we drove home, yesterday afternoon, 1Feb2021. My arm is slightly stiff still, just the muscle is slightly sore and I think, my husband is feeling a lot better today too, just slightly sore.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101.5 on 02Feb2021 and body temperature: 98.7 on Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever (pyrexia). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.

                                                I had sudden malaise, lost consciousness and my wife says was not breathing briefly. I revived and was taken to the hospital, and treated for 2 1/2 days with heart catheterization and TPA injected into my clot in the pulmonary arteries with good resolution. I did have cor pulmonale with acute severe right heart failure as part of that, Dr. thought the clot came from my right calf by his examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by CAT scan cardiac Echo and right heart catheterization.

                                                Paralyzed in his arms and legs; Legs were weak; Severe shivers; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 02Mar2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 75-years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dizziness, hyperuricemia (he produces too much uric acid and it causes kidney stones), back pain, COVID-19 in Dec2020 and was cleared by the end of Dec2020. Ongoing concomitant medications included diazepam for dizziness since 1978, allopurinol for hyperuricemia, oxycodone hydrochloride/paracetamol (PERCOCET) for back pain since 7-8 years ago. There were no other vaccines administered on the same day or within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL9262) on 09Feb2021 at 09:30 (at the age of 75-years-old) in the left arm and experienced muscle aches. On 02Mar2021 at 21:00, the patient experienced severe shivers. On 03Mar2021 at 02:30, the patient woke up to go to the bathroom and noticed his legs were weak. On 03Mar2021 at 07:00 he was paralyzed in his arms and legs- he could feel his muscles but couldn&#39;t make them move. He just laid there for ten hours, and it was scary, and he thought that over a period of time the vaccine would get filtered out. After that, he was fully recovered and able to move. The events did not require a visit to the physician or the emergency room. The patient was concerned that he got the second shot too soon after having COVID-19 in Dec2020. The clinical outcome of legs were weak and paralyzed in his arms and legs was resolved on 03Mar2021, severe shivers was resolved on 04Mar2021.

A 75-years-old male patient (husband) received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  Wife said her husband had Parkinson&#39;s Disease. The patient took his first COVID-19 Vaccine shot, and stayed a half hour after to be monitored. While she was driving her husband home from the COVID-19 Vaccine facility, she and her husband had only gone a couple blocks, and she saw her husband was fast asleep with drool coming out of his mouth. She said that was not normal for her husband, so she pulled their car over to wake her husband up. She was able to wake her husband. When her husband got home, he went to bed and slept the rest of the day. The patient was sleepy for a couple days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine. The outcome was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient was a healthy 75 year old male when he got the shot.  Within  5 hours, he began to feel TIRED, which was an expected side effect. He felt tired for several days. Nine days later he went to Memorial Hermann ER in Kingwood, and they said he had pneumonia. They also said he had a &#34;small mass&#34; at the bottom of his lung and might want to get it checked out. On March 20, he developed a cough. On March 21 we went to a different ER and a CT scan showed he had plureal effusion.  On the next day he was short winded. He went back to the ER and they admitted him and transferred him to hospital by ambulance.  On March 23, 1.7 liters of fluid was drained from his lung and sent to be tested. On March 26 he was diagnosed with malignant plureal effusion. He passed out at the doctor office and tranferred to to another facility by ambulance. He remained there for 4 days for tests, and a port was put in to drain the fluid. On March 29 he was transferred .  They repeated many tests and did a bronchoscopy.  On April 1 they told him he had squamous cell carcinoma.  He came home on April 2. The doctor called and said they made a mistake he had small cell carcinoma.  He remained home until April 11, when he was taken back to  by ambulance.  He had gone from a healthy appearing individual on March 17 to a critically ill individual and he died on April 15.  Doctors had never seen cancer overtake a man in 28 days. 28 days!!!!  On March 22, he had a small mass at the bottom of his lung, and one week later, it was a mass so large, his lung could not be seen and his lung had collapsed.  Doctors assumed that the cancer was dormant and that the vaccine did something to wake it. It attacked my husband with a vengeance.  He never smoked.
