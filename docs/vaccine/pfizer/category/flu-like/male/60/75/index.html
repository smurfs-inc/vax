                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

Overall the most likely cause of fever seems to be urosepsis w/ bacteremia, pending confirmation with urine &amp; blood cultures.

                                                The day after the vaccine, I felt a bit fatigued. Then for 2 days, I felt fine. Then starting on the 3rd day until present, I feel extremely light-headed and unsteady with a persistent severe headache.  Almost feels like there is pressure in my head for lack of a better description. I feel feverish as well but do not have a fever.  I have difficulty maintaining balance on my feet so it is difficult to walk.   I did seek medical attention yet since I live alone and do not feel comfortable to drive. Although the symptoms are difficult, I also don&#39;t consider them an emergency to warrant calling an ambulance.

Went home and still felt dizzy and then I felt like I need to pee  but I was very cold ,  urinated 3 more times thinking it was because it was due to being cold but doctor explained it was due to me drinking lost of water.  Went to bathroom and bassed out and woke up about an hour later, but during the fall I injured the neck by heating your head on the sink, back and broke my nose, when I woke up  I was still very dizzy. Also felt a fast heart rate,  chest pain, very nauseas and started sweating a lot.

A 61-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL9621), intramuscular on the left arm on 22Jan2021 (reported as 07:45 to 08:00) at a SINGLE DOSE for prevent COVID, at 61 years old. Medical history included triple bypass surgery from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime. Symptoms (unspecified which) reported as recurring and are notably worse at bedtime. Patient is hesitant to receive the second dose. The patient stated he just went to sleep and prayed and then when he woke the next day, at night it did it again. At night it comes and goes, and he still has it happen but not like the first time. He tried to describe that he was washing his hands and he almost passed out like on an unspecified date in Jan2021, he was going to lose his mind. Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown. Outcome of the events dizziness, &#34;feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his brain wanted to pop out of his head/ his brain wanted to swell up&#34;, felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy, and fever was reported as recovering.

History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl.

Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine. He took some Aleve which gave some relief (for significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain). He asked if this is an expected side effect as it seem out of proportion to him. Outcome of events general muscle pain and aches and weakness was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 29Jan2021. Outcome of events significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain was recovering. The reporting physician (patient) assessed the causality between the suspect vaccine and all events as related. He assessed the events &#34;swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain&#34; as medically significant (serious), while he assessed the other events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known product safety profile of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), the contributory role of the product cannot be totally excluded. The events are known adverse event of the product.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He complained that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and missed appointments saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the two weeks or so between the time of his second vaccine and his death.

A 62-year-old male patient received NT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL01-40), via an unspecified route of administration on 20Dec2020 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Anatomical Location provided as Left deltoid. Medical history provided as none. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). Physician stated, he got his Pfizer vaccine on last Sunday on 20Dec2020 around 9:30 there was usual soreness at the site of injection on 20Dec2020, which was there but no problem. But Monday (21Dec2020) after his vaccine that was Sunday he had and Monday night on 21Dec2020 he had chills he thought these were all just the reaction to the vaccine. Next day on 22Dec2020 he went into work he had mild body ache at work, at about 3:30 he felt a little sick and he got his temperature about 100.2, get home rested, next day on 23Dec2020 he worked from home, did not go so for next four days (from 24Dec2020 to 27Dec2020) he rested at home but his chills and body ache are not going away. They were there, they come and go, he took Tylenol, it went he have mild sore throat, cough on Dec2020. Today on 27Dec2020, the patient just took the temperature 100.7. For Causality assessment: Physician stated, &#34;he didn&#39;t know, he was just trying to find out to get to bottom of it. Is it really COVID infection or is it due to side effects as from what he read the reaction shouldn&#39;t really last long. It may last probably 3-4 days but this has gone beyond that so he was little concerned and the fever that he had was 7 days after the vaccine.&#34; The patient still had chills and body ache which he means they were not going away and now mild fever. When probed for the outcome of, Physician stated, &#34;They are persistent you know some day he had one day which was good but after that in the afternoon in the evening he felt the same thing. Fortunately, he was off for four days it didn&#39;t really have much problem, physically it was persistent has not gone away.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, had mild body ache, felt a little sick, cough, fever, mild sore throat. The outcome of events chills, mild body ache was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 25Jan2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing urinary incontinence (use of medication that does not make him run to the bathroom and helps him hold his urine), ongoing acne, drowsy, and ongoing flow of urine or weak bladder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included fesoterodine fumarate (TOVIAZ; Expiration Date: 04Dec2021) (about 2 weeks prior to getting the COVID-19 vaccine) for urinary incontinence, doxycycline (Expiration Date: 26Nov2021; makes him drowsy) for acne, and tamsulosin (Expiration Date: 12Nov2021) for flow of urine or weak bladder; all from Jan2021 and ongoing. The patient does not take any of these medications while driving. The patient took his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 25Jan2021 (Monday). The patient had been experiencing dizziness which started a few days after getting the vaccine (Jan2021). The patient was supposed to work from Tuesday to Friday, but he did not go into work on Wednesday. The patient was unsure of the specific day the dizziness started. The patient did have allergies (unspecified date), but when he called in his doctor, he sent him a medication for allergies, meclizine (Expiration Date: 28Jan2022). Normally, the medication takes a couple days to make him feel better. After he took meclizine for dizziness, he feels better. The patient notices the dizziness when he is up and moving around. The patient can tell something is off, like his equilibrium is off in Jan2021. It may not be due to the shot, but looking at the paper it says tiredness, which he has been feeling fatigued (also started a few days after the vaccine, but he is unsure specifically what day) and dizziness, which he has in Jan2021. The medication he is taking (meclizine), can also do the same thing, but never for this long. When he takes it, it normally makes him feel better after a few days. The patient has sinus problems as well on an unspecified date, but never lasting this long. The patient had not started feeling better since taking the medication, meclizine (as reported). The patient also said that meclizine could be causing the fatigue because it does make his drowsy and he just sleeps when he takes it - he cannot take it when he drives. The patient would go back for the second dose on 15Feb2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Dizziness when he is up and moving around&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Allergies&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

A 62-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EH9899, intramuscular in the left arm, on 08Jan2021 16:30 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and spinal surgery in Jan2019. Patient&#39;s eyesight was not the greatest. Patient previously received flu vaccine on an unspecified date (the last couple of years). Concomitant medication included amlodipine besilate for blood pressure. He was scheduled to get second dose on 29Jan2021. The Saturday before he was scheduled to get the second dose (23Jan2021), he started feeling sniffles and stuff. He went to urgent care and he was tested for covid and the test came back negative. He then kept feeling bad. He clarified that on 24Jan2021, he had headache and nausea. He had chills and he was beated down with sweat; body aches which are constant and he  would try to blame it on the position he was laying in while on the couch and it was not that; and does not have an appetite on an unspecified day in Jan2021. He has been in really bad shape for the last 9 or 10 days. When he went to go get his second shot, they would not give it to him due to his symptoms that he was experiencing since she had a fever at 100.4 the night before (28Jan2021). They scheduled him to get his second dose the following which was this Friday. He was asking if his side effects are totally normal. He cannot even sleep, reported that he will sleep an hour and then up for two or three hours. It really has him, and he feels miserable. The outcome of events Chills, nausea and fever at 100.4 was not recovered. Outcome of sniffles was recovered in Jan 2021 while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test; COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test; Sweating; Fever; running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; Heart pounding; tired and fatigue; Weight loss; Chills; pain all over the body; Sluggishness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 63-years-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 21Dec2020 14:40, at a single dose for Covid 19. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient has no prior vaccinations -within 4 weeks. The patient is an EEG technician. On 22Dec2020, the patient reported the next day he started to feel sluggish, chills, tired/fatigue, pain all over his body, patient mentioned he has lost weight everyday since he got the shot from 153 pounds to 142 pounds; then on Wednesday evening 23Dec2020, it was a nightmare, he got sweating; fever with a high of 101.4 Fahrenheit; he was running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; and he was so tired and fatigued. Added when he was getting up all that night he was having night sweats up to five times a night and chills; and his heart was pounding. The urination, heart pounding resolved the next day. All of these events have improved at the time of report (now) or gone away but he is still sweating once at night for the last two days and he is tired and fatigued. He stated that he is scheduled for the second dose on 11Jan2021 and he is concerned if he should take the vaccine. He mentioned that he was tested for COVID 19 on 18Dec2020 and the result was inconclusive. He went again 23Dec2020 they called him on 25Dec2020 and informed he was positive per the PCR test. He treated himself with 500mg acetaminophen (UPC 0904672059; lot OBE2896 and expiration Oct2021) and azithromycin Z-Pack (NDC 65862-641-69; Lot ZYSA20012-A; and expiration date Mar2022). The sample of the product is not available to be returned. Predisposing factor was that the patient&#39;s wife was at home and was sick too at the same time. She was tested Sunday with no results yet. The outcome of the events of fever recovered on 28Dec2020, sluggishness recovered on 29Dec2020, pain all over the body was recovered on 02Jan2021; running to the bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine and heart pounding were recovered on 24Dec2020, weight loss was not recovered, and for other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (4 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between event &#34;COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / SARS-CoV-2 test positive) and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded

A 63-year-old male patient received the 1st does of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose left upper arm on 23Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history included ongoing hypertension that began maybe 10 years before and still ongoing, controlled with medication. No family medical history relevant to the events. The concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL). History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the suspect. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. He has not had reactions to any other vaccines. On 30Dec2020 he tested positive for Covid. His symptoms of covid started 27Dec2020 in the evening sometime probably around 7pm. He experienced cough in Dec2020. No visit to physician office was required. On the 06Jan2021 he went to the emergency room but that was because he was concerned about rash he developed. He thought it was due to the Tylenol he was taking. Relevant tests performed in Ja2021 included: blood work and chest X-ray did when he went in for the rash and they were was fine. He was treated with steroid injection for the rash. The rash cleared up in the next couple days. As of 12Jan2021 the only thing he has cough but he coughs anyway. He still had a cough but it was not atypical for him to have a cough. He was scheduled to receive his second dose on 13Jan2021. He no longer had any Covid symptoms and wanted to know if he could still get the second dose as scheduled. The outcome of event tested positive for the virus and not recovered was unknown, of coughs was not recovered. A Product Complaint was filed.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

Increase in metabolism leading to being warm all the time ( no sweating).  Two weeks after second vaccine and while experiencing the above symptoms, I had sudden palpitations with a rapid ventricular response ( 186 beats per minute), severe light headedness, ambulance transport to hospital leading to admission for two days.  This has never happened to me or any family members before.  Discharged from hospital after 2 days in normal rhythm.  Also at this time, taste has returned to normal and foggy feeling has improved.

A 63-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose on the left arm for vaccination. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism. Concomitant medication include levothyroxine (manufacturer unknown) from an unspecified date probably 2-3 years ago and ongoing for hypothyroidism. The patient reported that the first dose was administered of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 04Jan2021. He had onset of soreness in left arm that day, 14Jan2021 which he recovered completely from by 05Jan2021. He stated that starting maybe 05Jan2021 or 06Jan2021, he had onset of feeling kind of achy and like he was wanting to run a fever. Starting 08Jan2021, he started running a very high fever in excess of 102 degrees Fahrenheit which has been ongoing and persistent since then. He has been taking Tylenol every 6 hours to try to control the high fever but the high fever is just not going away. He was wondering if there is anything he can do because his primary care physician (PCP) can&#39;t really help him at the clinic; He was wondering if Pfizer is familiar with this reaction and if there are any recommendations regarding them. He has taken Tylenol to help, but it is not making it go away. He wanted to know if steroids could be used to counteract this side effect. He added that he is supposed to get the second dose 25Jan2021 but he does not plan to get the second dose, at this point he does not want to do that. He was administered the vaccine because his mother lives in an assisted living facility where the vaccine was offered to residents; and because he acts as a sitter at the facility it was offered to him. On 11Jan2021 he went to Urgent Care for these events, and was given a Rapid COVID-19 Test which had negative result. The outcome of the event soreness in left arm was recovered on 05Jan2021, the outcome of the event was wanting to run a fever/very high fever in excess of 102 degrees fahrenheit was not recovered and the outcome of the event feeling kind of achy was unknown.

By 10:30pm, I began having flu like symptoms, (aches, low grade fever, sinus symptoms) took another acetaminophen 1 GM.  At 11:00 pm, developed severe rigors that lasted for approximately 2 hours. I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

                                                64-year-old male who presented to the clinic with complaints of left-sided weakness on his face. He stated when he woke up this morning he noticed that the left side of his mouth drooped and that he could not close his left eye all the way. Yesterday he felt fine. Today he went to work. Patient stated that on 12/18 he got the COVID vaccine. It was on a Friday. The following day he had a headache and he felt flu-like. He stated that those symptoms resolved quickly. He then had the facial weakness today (11 days after the vacciantion). He has not had any fever, sweats, or chills. Patient stated that he had called ask a nurse, and he was advised to hang up and call 911 and go to the emergency room. However, he stated he was an EMT and did not feel that was necessary. He denies headache. He has not had any vision change. He has been eating and drinking well without any difficulty.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General appearance - patient was not in any distress. He was conversant, pleasant and appropriate. HEENT - normal conjunctivae and lids. Sclerae anicteric. Pupils equal and reactive to light. Patient was not able to close his left eyelid. Normal ear canals. TMs are pearly gray with bright light reflex. Neck - supple. No lymphadenopathy. Skin - pink, warm and dry. Neuro - alert and oriented. Deep tendon reflexes 2&#43; upper and lower extremities with no focal weakness. Normal range of motion. Patient can raise his right eyebrow. Could not raise his left eyebrow. There was impaired eyelid closure on the left; tight closure on the right. Smiling of the face revealed lateralization to the right side. When frowning, he had upper and lower facial paralysis on the left with flattening of the forehead. The patient could not tighten the left side of his mouth.   ASSESSMENT: Bell&#39;s palsy.   PLAN: Discussed pathophysiology of Bell&#39;s palsy. Advised patient I recommended him to call the number that he got with the information when he received his COVID vaccine. Advised patient that I could not definitively correlate the Bell&#39;s palsy with the COVID immunization, but that he can call the number he has to let them know of his symptoms. Discussed treatment options. Since patient woke up with his symptoms this morning, I advised patient that he would have hopefully the best outcome because he would be able to get on the steroid and antiviral soon after developing the symptoms. He is to wear an eye patch to prevent corneal drying or abrasion of the left eye at night. Using Lacri-Lube at night before placing the eye patch and then following up by using artificial tears during the day.   Patient was placed on prednisone 60 mg once a day for 1 week to be taken with food. Valtrex 1,000 mg 3 times a day for 1 week.   Side effects of medication discussed. Handouts were provided. He will follow up with PCP if any changes or concerns. Advised patient that it may take up to 3 weeks before all his symptoms have resolved

Medical history bypass surgery (10.5 years ago, in June it will be 11 years ago) and hard of hearing. Patient said he used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but right now he is 5&#39;6&#34; or 5&#39;5&#34;. He says that change in his height happened before he got the vaccine, that is effects of being short. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) and simvastatin. It was reported that the patient had been healthy all his life, he doesn&#39;t have any medical conditions which could have contributed to side effects. He does not think they would have contributed but he takes Simvastatin and Baby Aspirin. The patient got the vaccination, the first one (BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization, on unspecified date) he did not have anything happen, no side effects or nothing. It was as if he didn&#39;t receive any vaccine. The second dose he received it at 8:45 AM on Sunday (10Jan2021) and Sunday night he began experiencing tiredness and then chills, fever, generalized aches and could hardly sleep through the night. It was reported as the worst night in his life and then, fortunately during the day on Monday, gradually, the intensity and severity of the symptoms began to subside but he was not able to do any of his normal functions. Then last night Monday night (11Jan2021) he slept well and today on Tuesday (12Jan2021) he was okay, this morning everything was fine. On Tuesday night he took Acetaminophen for pain, he clarified that was Sunday night after he had gotten the vaccine he took Acetaminophen and he still had the problems then Monday night he thought it would be the same so he put the medicine next to the bed on the night stand but he did not need to take it. He slept and woke up this morning and his back to work. Now it is like nothing has happened. He has recovered completely from all effects. The outcome of the event could hardly sleep through the night was recovered on 11Jan2021 and all the other events recovered on 12Jan2021.

Concomitant medication included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) from unspecified date to 27Jan2021 for 6 stents, paracetamol (TYLENOL, 500 mg, caplets, NDC Number: 5058044936, Lot Number: SJA066 and Expiration Date: Jul2024). The patient said he received his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 16Jan2021. He said at the time he pre-medicated with 2 paracetamol. He said he had read afterwards that it is not recommended to pre-medicate with Tylenol before receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 24Jan2021 he developed a fever of 100.4 Degree F (body temperature). He stated his fever was 8 days after receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. On 27Jan2021, he was urinating blood/blood clots and was admitted to the hospital and treated for a UTI. He was diagnosed with a genitourinary infection (UTI). He clarified on the morning of 27Jan2021 his urine looked darker than normal. He said he went to physical therapy (PT) on 27Jan2021. He said when he came back from PT, and went to the bathroom, there was blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he called his urologist, and his urologist saw him on 27Jan2021. He said his urologist took a urine sample, and his urine sample was clear and negative for nitrites. He clarified his urologist did a digital prostate exam, and his prostate was fine. He said his urologist wanted him to make an appointment for a cystoscopy, and a CAT scan of his abdomen and pelvis. He said after he got home from the urologist, he went to the bathroom, and again had blood and blood clots in his urine. He went to emergency room. While he was in the Emergency Room, he was set-up on CBI (Continuous Bladder Irrigation). He said the urologist did not seem concerned about the amount of blood in his urine. He clarified he was admitted to the hospital, and had in place for approximately 16 hours. Next day (28Jan2021) he was diagnosed with a gram negative urinary tract infection. He said he was given a daily dose of IV Ceftriaxone 1gram on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021. He said he was also given a daily dose on 29Jan2021 and 30Jan2021 of IV Ferrlecit 125mg because his iron level was low at 21. He said a normal iron level for a male is 35. On 31Jan2021 he had injection site pain in his left arm, he said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was red and puffy. He said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site pain, redness, and puffiness resolved on the same day, 31Jan2021. He said his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was given in the same arm (left) on 06 Feb2021. He stated he asked that the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose be given in the same arm (left) because his left arm is his non-dominant arm. He was discharged from the hospital on 30Jan2021, and was given a prescription to take 1 Levaquin 250mg orally for 3 days starting on 31Jan2021. He said the Levaquin 250mg was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, and did not have the NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. He said he was also prescribed oral Feosol 325mg, twice a day, starting on 31Jan2021. He provided the Feosol 325mg, NDC Number: 12451-10-17 (unsure if he provided the correct NDC), Lot Number: 201167, and Expiration Date: Jul2022. At around 2:30-3:00PM on 31Jan2021, he developed a rash on his hip and back, saying the hip and back rash were along the same pathway. He said he spoke to a PA (physician assistant) about his rash. He said on 31Jan2021 he had taken 1 oral dose of the Levaquin 250mg. He said the PA discontinued the oral Levaquin 250mg, and changed his prescription to Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, for 5 days. He said he started the Macrobid 100mg, twice a day, on Monday, 01Feb2021. He said he completed the Macrobid 100mg prescription on Sunday, 07Feb2021, and did not have the Macrobid 100mg NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. He clarified his rash was raised, oozy, and looked weird, like a pimple that came to head. He said he spoke to his dermatologist on a video call Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said his dermatologist told him he had shingles and prescribed Valtrex 1gram, three times a day, for 7-10 days. He stated the Valtrex 1gram was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle. He said he took his first Valtrex 1gram dose on Sunday evening, 31Jan2021, and was still taking the Valtrex 1gram as of today (08Feb2021). He had an appointment to see his dermatologist in person on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, but woke up with a wicked headache that morning, so he took paracetamol and went back to sleep. He said when he woke, he still had headache, and his left eye was totally blurry. He said back in Nov2020 he had fallen at work and landed on his left side, hitting his head and left knee. He said his fall left him with a knot on the left side of his head, and he had bleeding from above his left eyebrow, and had a left black eye. He said he also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He said he had a CT scan of his head that showed the subarachnoid hemorrhage was contained, so the doctors wanted to just monitor him. He said he was on Effient at the time and the doctors changed him to Plavix. He said he also was taking Aspirin 81mg. He said he was taken off of Plavix on 27Jan2021 when he was admitted to the hospital for having blood and blood clots in his urine. He said he continues to take the Aspirin 81mg daily. He clarified he has been on compensation since his fall in Nov2020. He said he also had cataract surgery 2 years ago. He said he immediately called his eye doctor, and then went to the hospital Emergency Room because he thought he had a stroke. He said the Emergency room did a CAT scan and CTA of his head, which were both normal. He said a neurologist saw him in the Emergency Room, and said since it was a headache with one eye blurriness, he should see his eye doctor. He said the neurologist told him if he had a headache and both eyes were blurry, it would more likely have been a stroke. He stated when he was discharged from the Emergency Room on 03Feb2020, he went directly to his eye doctor. He said his eye doctor did several tests: field of vision, a sonogram, pictures of his left eye, and a dilation of his eyes. He said he had an eye test where he looked at a half circle and clicked a counter when he saw dots, and another eye test where he stared at something that looked like a hot air balloon, while the eye doctor took measurements. He said the eye doctor also measured his eye pressure, which was normal. He said he was at his eye doctor&#39;s office for a good couple of hours. He said his eye doctor told him that he has little white dots on the background area of his eyes that indicates he has severe eye dryness. He said his left eye is much worse than right eye. He said his eye doctor asked him if he took Crack, or Cocaine, or any kind of opioids in the last few weeks. He said he told his doctor he took 1 dose of an opioid on 31Jan2021 because of the shingles pain. He clarified he had a Percocet prescription leftover from his hospitalization in Nov2020. He said he took another dose of the Percocet the week before 31Jan2021 for pain in his knee from the fall he had in Nov2020. He said his eye doctor told him his dry eyes could be caused by the Percocet. He said his eye doctor prescribed lubricating eye drops (Refresh Optive Mega 3, UPC Number: 0023577330, Lot Number: T095, and Expiration Date: Aug2022), that he is to use in both eyes every hour, and an eye ointment in his left eye only at bedtime. He had been using crutches when he walks because of the problem with his right knee since he fell in Nov2020. He said on 06Feb2021, he took a shower, and when he went to get out of the shower, his right leg gave out. He said he didn&#39;t fall, but he couldn&#39;t walk afterwards. He said he went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021, and an x-ray and sonogram were done of his right knee. He said he was told he had another soft tissue injury like he had when he fell back in Nov2020. He said he was given a leg immobilizer to use. He said when he first fell in Nov2020, he originally fell on his left knee. He said he has had PT since being discharged from the hospital on 17Nov2020. He said he also had a pacemaker implanted while he was in the hospital in Nov2020. He said after his discharge from the hospital on 17Nov2020, he went to take shower at home on 18Nov2020 and his left knee gave out. He said he was able to lower himself to the floor in the shower stall, but he couldn&#39;t get out of the shower stall. He said he was left sitting on his left leg and he couldn&#39;t use his right leg. He said he finally got himself to bed, and iced his right knee because he sat on it for over an hour. He said the next day (19Nov2020), he couldn&#39;t walk and had to have an ambulance take him to Emergency Room. He said he hasn&#39;t had PT since 27Jan2021, and needs clearance from his doctor before he can restart PT. He said he has been without PT for 2 weeks now. He said on 06Feb2021 he was unable to get a MRI on his knee because he had too much swelling that would have made the MRI imaging cloudy. On 06Feb2021 he was due for his second COVID-19 Vaccine, so before he was discharged from the Emergency Room he was given his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. He was using the Refresh Optive Mega 3 eye drops constantly now. He said he had no fever, but is more tired than in the past. He said the last couple of days he can sleep for hours, and wake up and feel like he can go right back to sleep. He said he and his cardiologist are concerned because since 27Jan2021, he has only been on Aspirin 81mg. He said he has 3 cardiac stents since Oct2020, and should be on dual therapy. He said he had a CT of his abdomen and pelvis while he was in the hospital. He said he has been off of Plavix since 27Jan2021, and can restart the Plavix until he has a cystoscopy. He wants to know if UTIs in men are common after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, so he can decide if he should cancel the cystoscopy and restart his Plavix. The second COVID-19 Vaccine Lot number as EL9261 or EI9261. He stated the vaccine lot number was handwritten on his COVID-19 Vaccine immunization card and was difficult to read the handwritten vaccine lot number. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included bacterial sepsis: gram negative urinary tract infection on 28Jan2021. Clarified he had no pain, burning, or urgency with the UTI. He said he was told by the hospital he had gram negative rods in his urine, when he was started on the IV Ceftriaxone on 29Jan2021. He stated he has never had a UTI before. Clarified his body temperature is rarely 98.6 degrees, and is normally 98.2 degrees and he had never had shingles before. He said he had chicken pox as a young adult, and he only had 1 spot of chicken pox. He had never had dry eyes before. Reporter seriousness for fever, UTI, injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness, rash, shingles were medically significant. For other events were unspecified. The outcome of event injection site pain, injection site redness, injection site puffiness was recovered on 31Jan2021, dry eye, tiredness was not recovered, while the outcomes of other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known possible local reaction, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of injection site pain, redness, and puffiness cannot be excluded. The other events are considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to the use of BNT162B2.

                                                occipital neuralgia; left-side Bells Palsy; bilateral headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (Lot/batch number and Expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration at right deltoid on 21Dec2020 19:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included low high density lipoprotein (HDL). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (longer than 4 weeks ago, and he did not have any reaction), pravastatin for low HDL. Reported 2 days ago (02Jan2021) he developed a bilateral headache. He stated he was asymptomatic until then. He said he now has Bells Palsy on 02Jan2021, clarified he has left-side Bells Palsy. He said it is unknown to him if the bilateral headache and Bells Palsy are related to taking the COVID-19 Vaccine. He stated he started wearing a N95 mask for the past 2 weeks. He said the N95 mask is very tight on the back of his head. He said he believes he is experiencing occipital neuralgia caused by wearing the N95 mask. He said studies show that the N95 mask can cause Bells Palsy, and the N95 mask maybe a confounding factor. He stated he doesn&#39;t have any further information on the N95 mask he was using. Initially he had a severe headache and administered to himself a sphenopalatine block of Lidocaine 1% in his nose. He stated being an ER doctor, he knows how to administer the sphenopalatine block to a patient. He went to the ER on 03Jan2021 to make sure he did not have a tumor or a stroke. He said the hospital performed a CT of his head, a MRA, labs, and a COVID-19 test (clarified as a PCR COVID-19 test) with a full viral count. He said all the tests were negative. His wife noticed his Bells Palsy yesterday, 03Jan2021. He said he thinks the Bells Palsy started the night before on 02Jan2021. He said he noticed on the night of 02Jan2021 when he was brushing his teeth, he hit a tooth on that side (clarified as left side) of his mouth with his tooth brush. He hasn&#39;t started taking steroids yet, but will be starting steroids real soon. He clarified his doctor prescribed a Medrol dose pack and Valtrex for the Bells Palsy. He stated he has not started the Medrol dose pack and Valtrex. He is ordering Lidocaine 1% viscous for himself, so he can do an internasal sphenopalatine block on himself. He does not know if the bilateral headache and Bells Palsy were caused by taking the COVID-19 Vaccine. The events required Emergency Room visit. The outcome of the event Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered,  Headache was recovering, Occipital neuralgia was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162b2 and the onset of Bell&#39;s palsy/Headache might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

On the day pt was vaccinated, his sister picked him up for the appointment and pt refused a wheelchair. Pt walked into the clinic on his own and recevied his vaccine. Sister reported pt walked to the car after his vaccine and was winded. She dropped him off at his house and called him later to check up on him. Pt stated he was feeling fine but his arm was sore. Pt&#39;s sister called the next morning and reported that he sounded terrible. He was strugging to breathe and was SOB. His sister went over to his house to check on him and wanted to take him to the doctor&#39;s office or the hospital. Pt refused at that time. Pt agreed to make a doctor appointment for later in the afternoon. Sister left at noon. She stated her brother had made a doctor appointment for 4:00 at Family Practice. Upon arriving, pt started walking towards the entrance and became SOB. His significant other asked the doctor&#39;s office for a  wheelchair and was denied. Pt coded in parking lot of Doctor&#39;s Office and passed away at 4:31 p.m.

Covid was not tested post vaccination. The outcome of events was not recovered.  His colleague now knows he should have waited 90 days after the antibody but reporter was wondering if there was information. Since there probably is no information, this is a unique situation and reporter wondered if Pfizer wants him to run any particular tests or send in some blood to Pfizer for testing to further medical knowledge on giving the vaccine within 90 days of the antibodies.

                                                Became weak on Monday 12/28/20 in the evening and fell off the chair . Was semi-unconscious for 5 minutes . When I came to my wife took my BP 88/60 . I felt weak that evening and  went to bed early. I woke up fine that next day. No symptoms since.  No  medical follow required,

                                                Starting about 16 hours post-injection, left arm was becoming very sore and painful to move.. almost 24 hours post-injection I started getting strong chills. I was shivering and chattering on the walk out to the car (it was 30 degrees outside). When I got home, even though it was New Year&#39;s Eve, I put a light jacket on and sat in my cozy chair most of the evening, celebrated New Year&#39;s with the family, then I had to put on flannel pajamas in order to be warm enough to sleep. I usually don&#39;t have to wear pajamas to bed. And for most of New Year&#39;s Day I kept the pajamas on and a light jacket and I was in my chair most of the day trying not to shiver. The shivering finally stopped late on the First, about 54 hours post-injection. And over the weekend the pain in my arm slowly went away, and by now, one week post-injection, I feel no pain in my arm at all.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

Approximately 2 weeks post-injection, I developed coryzal symptoms of nasal stuffiness and congestion without fever, chills, headache, or myalgias. On, or about, 3/3/21, I noticed diminution of hearing in the left ear without signs of drainage, fever, or dizziness. This was treated with a Z Pac, nasal and oral decongestants, and nasal steroids. Over the course of 10 days, the hearing decline had improved, but a clinical exam and testing by an ENT on 3/12/21 confirmed evidence suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss, with asymmetric impairment in the affected (left) ear.

He took it couple of days ago. He took it on the 30th of this month, two days ago. Physician further stated he developed the fever for all about 30 hours after the vaccination. Just because he developed the fever with the first one, it was like a 101.7 that was about 36 hours. So the question was just because he developed the fever with the first one, he was pretty sick, he meant he felt palsy, you know headache and all that it was like probably developed the same with the second one? Patient weight was maybe 125 pounds. When probed if vaccine was prescribed by any Physician, Physician stated he went himself. Causality by physician stated as &#34;he think so&#34;. Lab work reported as He did not have the results yet. He just look a Covid screening test because he had Covid back on the 04Dec. So, he just took a Covid screening test. Treatment received included aspirin.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3302 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol since 90s and was taking medication to keep it down, and ongoing neuropathy in the feet back in the 90s. Patient seemed to be okay after the vaccination until he didn&#39;t rest well last night on 13Jan2021. The morning of 14Jan2021, he had chills and was aching all over. He has a headache, and he was pretty tired on 14Jan2021. His temperature was 99.9. and wanted to make sure he was okay. They gave him the sheet of side effects but was wondering how long it was going to last. He also had fever and chills on Jan2021. He has been just resting all day long which was all he felt like doing. Patient felt he has a bad case of the flu. When his chills started, he noticed he was tremoring and shaking and his muscles are achy on Jan2021. He usually waits until his temperature is over 100 to take something and noticed where he got the shot was achy on Jan2021. During the night he went to aching more. He was not too excited about getting up and doing anything now. He was tired on 14Jan2021, because he didn&#39;t rest well last night and slept in late today. He finally got around, and ate cereal and stuff. He has just been sitting. He would still get the second vaccine, which was not exciting. Outcome of the events aching all over, headaches, and tired are not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

And the other symptoms came and went in 36 hours.  The symptoms I did have are the same as a bad reaction to the 2nd vaccine.  (my muscle aches are not a reaction to the vaccine).  Yet, my reaction was not immediate, rather it was 2 weeks and 1 day after my first vaccine.  Therefore, do I have COVID, or a bad reaction to my first vaccine? WAITING for COVID test results.  Second vaccination is scheduled for upcoming Friday, February 26.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration (arm left) on 24Jan2021 03:30 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation, at 67 years old. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from an unknown date, stent placement from an unknown date, and ongoing polycythaemia ulcer from an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included unspecified normal medicines, diabetic medicine, ulcer medicine, and vitamins. Patient wanted to know if a runny nose after receiving the Covid injection was common and how long does it last. The patient stated that he received the first dose of the vaccine on Sunday and on 27Jan2021 he experienced a runny nose. The patient also asked how long adverse reactions happens and how many days after the vaccine. The patient has polycythemia ulcers and notices that they are acting up. He got the shot on 24Jan2021, 03:30 (Sunday), and the Polycythemia Ulcers are acting up as well as he has a runny nose. The Runny nose was noticed on one side and was initially congested, he then took his normal vitamins and an hour later his nose started to run, this all occurred on reporting time, 27Jan2021. The Ulcers acting up was also on 27Jan2021. The patient was queried when his Polycythemia was diagnosed, he stated that he was actually in the process of it being diagnosed, he has basically had all the tests that confirms, there&#39;s one more left, but he has been doing blood draws and it is almost confirmed. He was just asking his question because he noticed that this did not occur the same day as getting the vaccine and it came later. For the runny nose he took a ZYRTEC decongestant and it worked for a while but did not hold it off, however it is not like a faucet like it was earlier, it was better now. He described his Polycythemia Ulcers being located internally on the heart and esophagus, being at the lower part of the stomach. By his ulcers acting up he means that it feels like indigestion and its real bad, it hurts, he has not had food, it feels like when they take a pint of his blood every month, to get him low in iron, it was like a pit in the stomach that hurts. He took famotidine. He does not know if he should have taken it or not, but he saw there was some problem with somebody in (state name) with platelets. He had the Famotidine about half an hour before reporting time. The patient was asked to clarify what he meant about somebody in (state name), he stated that he was looking online and saw something about a doctor died because of the Low platelet count. The patient was aware that famotidine lowers platelets and was just asking. The patient stated that he was not saying the doctor took famotidine, but his blood was not getting clotting. Regarding Covid Vaccine Card, from it he read PF17c12 but does not know what this is for, there was an expiry but he cannot read the writing. Outcome of the events was recovering.  The reporter considered the events as non-serious.

Patient received the covid19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 2/9/2021, vaccine was administered without complications. No prior positive for covid19. After patient received his covid19 vaccine, he was seen at same day access for increased SOB/DOE, worsened orthopnea. Per progress notes, at this last appt, patient had expressed a number of medications which he was not willing to take, attributing his worsened health to their effects. Pt has continued spironolactone despite being advised to stop it by his medical provider. At the time of visit, provider noted that this kidney function was declining (patient does have CKD). Provider discussed the importance of medication adherence and patient was started on torsemide. Hctz was discontinued, minoxidil was increased due to patient preference. Prior to this same day access/express care visit, patient was hospitalized from 1/26 through 1/28/2021 for hypertensive urgency (211/105) and that at that time, pt already had orthopnea, SOB, and dyspnea. Patient was also admitted from 1/7 to 1/8 and left AMA. While inpatient, his MRI revealed a pontine lacunar infarct that was found to be chronic. It was recommended that patient be treated with aspirin/plavix for 21 days then aspirin alone but patient declined.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9263), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm (shoulder), on 26Jan2021 at 12:00, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, acid reflux, and multivitamin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, esomeprazole for acid reflux, and ascorbic acid/ biotin/ boron/ calcium/ calcium pantothenate/ chloride/ chromium/ colecalciferol/ copper/ cyanocobalamin/ folic acid/ iodine/ lycopene/ magnesium/ manganese/ molybdenum/ nickel/ nicotinamide/ phosphorus/ phytomenadione/ potassium/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol acetate/ riboflavin/ selenium/ silicon dioxide/ sodium metavanadate/ thiamine mononitrate/ tocopheryl acetate/ xantofyl/ zinc (CENTRUM SILVER ADULTS 50&#43;) as multivitamin, all were ongoing; omeprazole for acid reflux; and an unspecified multivitamin.  The patient really had no issues going on prior to onset of these events. The patient has been administered both first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. The patient had been having some strange things that he didn&#39;t know if its COVID-19 shot related but they&#39;re symptoms he never had before. About 8 to 11 days after first dose of the vaccine (Feb2021; maybe 09Feb2021 or 10Feb2021), the patient had a very, very lightheaded episode where he almost passed out or almost fainted. The patient clarified he thinks one event was like 8 days and the other was like 10 days after the vaccine doses were administered, but is not sure, so left it as about 8 to 11 days. Also, in Feb2021, the patient had almost a very light headache where he almost fainted. The patient went to the emergency room in Feb2021 and was admitted to hospital from about 13:00 that day, overnight and discharged about 17:00 to 18:00 the following day. The patient spent the night in hospital, they sent him the next day. While in hospital (Feb2021), the patient had electrocardiograms (EKGs) of his head (as reported), magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) of his head, computed tomography (CTs; CT scan with contrast) of his head, and echocardiograms of his heart (microcardiogram). All of those tests came back normal (okay), nothing abnormal on results. They were relating this to a stroke-like symptom; however, the results were normal, also his blood test results were fine. The patient had blood work done the first time he was in the emergency room when he was admitted to the hospital in Feb2021; they took his blood 3 to 4 times while he was there overnight and blood work results all came back normal. The patient was not sure what they were testing for, but thinks they were looking for stroke type things because the event almost made him pass out. They did not draw more blood the second emergency room visit. Because of the first episode, the patient then went to his family doctor and the doctor ordered some other testing done. The patient was scheduled to get a nuclear stress test and an exercise stress test (stress test of heart), his results on 10Mar2021 came back normal (not performed until after the second reported event following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine). The patient believed that the results of those tests both came back good, family doctor emailed him the results which were normal. The patient was continuing to have some lightheaded episodes or symptoms just about daily but nothing really; continued to have symptoms which was not normal for him. Sometimes, they last for 30 minutes or more, multiple times a day. Sometimes, the patient had a good day, but he had those lightheaded episodes and he never had it before he got the shot. As therapeutic measures in the hospital, the emergency room gave the patient something for dizziness when he was there, but he was no longer taking it. Currently, the patient was really taking nothing. The patient had also gone to the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor where he had a balance test or a videonystagmography (VNG) test done on 17Mar2021. The patient will get results of balance test on Wednesday (24Mar2021). Every year (unspecified), the patient goes and get his yearly test in which they had his blood work done and this and his glucose levels were always good, cholesterol level was always good. All the patient&#39;s other tests come back as normal on an unspecified date. The patient had never had these symptoms before, he hasn&#39;t changed his medications or habits and it&#39;s odd that this happened 9 to 10 days after both doses of the vaccine. The patient would like to know if this has been reported before as a side effect related to the vaccine. The patient was not sure if the events are Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine related, but they never happened to him before those doses were administered. He does not know if this is vaccine related or just coincidence that they popped up at the same time as the vaccine doses. Also, he does not know if events could be age related, the medical community can&#39;t figure it out so he is trying to get information on if events could be related to the vaccines. So the patient doesn&#39;t know if anybody else is reporting this but he had 2 sorts of severe episodes both of them around days after each shot and he was continuing to have lightheaded episodes but not severe as those 2 but he had lightheaded (dizzy) episodes daily, since the COVID-19 vaccine. But they didn&#39;t know what brought these episodes on, other than timing wise it was during the COVID-19 shot. And he never had anything like that, and he was not blaming it on the COVID-10 shot. That was the only thing changed in his lifestyle. There might be a possibility, because that&#39;s the only thing changed, his medication has not changed, and diet doesn&#39;t change. Nothing has changed other than the patient got COVID-19 shots. The patient wanted to report it, so the company had a report file and other people reporting it. The patient wanted to know if the company was having any other report or something like this so that he would know if it might be related to the shot. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Lightheaded; almost fainted; dizzy; dizziness&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Vacinnated on Friday..following Sunday evening noticed bumps, blisters, hives on both of my hands in the pad areas of my hands. extended into the tips of index fingers and thumbs. very sensitive to the touch. I took some Benedril which helped with swelling. that was the most severe after effect. I&#39;m pretty sure it was the vaccine because i had not been anywhere that weekend and had not  put my hands on anything unusual that i don&#39;t normally touch. It only happened to my hands. Other than that i had minor flu like symtoms from the shot,  achiness and slight fatigue feeling. I had an ER doctor look at my hands when i went in today to get help for my bronchitis, which i had some before the covid shot. It got worse on Monday. He perscribed prednisone which has pretty much taken the hand spots away..i was tested negative for covid today(1/19/21) by the way.

A 68-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 28Dec2020 at 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included diabetic and blood pressure high, both from 10-15 years.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient does nursing homes and assisted living facilities and also the employees of the nursing home. The patient received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 28Dec2020 at 1800 PM in the left arm. He tested negative on 27Dec2020, 04Jan2021, and 08Jan2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 11Jan2021, which was 2 weeks after the administration of the vaccine. He reported no severe symptoms, all he got from the COVID-19 infection was a little bit of chills, temperatures rising to a maximum of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (temperature back and forth), body aches, oxygen levels at 95%, and no cough. His oxygen saturation has always been good between 95% and 96%. The patient asked what caused the positive test and asked if he was going to have protection after receiving the first dose of COVID vaccine. The patient is due for the second dose of the COVID vaccine on Monday, the 18th (18Jan2021), in which he will still be under isolation. The patient asked if he should wait until he gets out of isolation to receive the second vaccine. The patient asked if that is part of the vaccine to test positive for COVID or if he actually does have COVID. The patient also asked if he can have the second dose. He will be unable to receive second dose of the COVID vaccine at the 21-day mark due to being in isolation from the COVID virus. The patient was recovering from the events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), intramuscular in the left arm on 19Jan2021 (at 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   Medical history included blood cholesterol of 200 (not further specified).  The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included irbesartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 19Jan2020 at 08:00, after the vaccine, that patient was at work and was feeling unwell and the patient was found by his secretary unconscious. An ambulance was called. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was 79/38 and electrocardiogram showed acute myocardial infarction. He underwent one stent placement with the remaining arteries normal. He was also started on ticagrelor (BRILINTA), metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and atorvastatin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient immediately improved and was feeling well and resumed exercise. The clinical outcomes of the unconscious, acute myocardial infarction, and feeling unwell were recovering. The events required emergency room visit and were assessed as serious for requiring hospitalization for 2 days and being life-threatening.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that reported events acute myocardial infarction, unconsciousness and feeling unwell are related to BNT162B2.  The events are more likely intercurrent medical condition for this elderly patient. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Batch/lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hyperlipidaemia (this was diagnosed about 10 years ago), nasal spray, borderline thyroid, coronary artery disease (very mild, it was diagnosed a couple years ago) all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included montelukast, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) at 75mcg for his borderline thyroid, levothyroxine. The patient experienced covid-19 molecular test: positive/covid-19 PCR test: positive on 06Jan2021, covid-19 vaccine: arm pain/his arm was sore, cough on an unspecified date. The events were reported as non-serious. Caller said he got the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 31Dec2020 on New Years Eve, and then on 06Jan2021 came down with COVID, then subsequently got the Eli Lilly monoclonal antibodies infusion and has postponed getting the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine until 90 days after getting the infusion, which means second dose will be 08Apr2021. He said since he is 68 he qualified to get the infusion on Jan 8th. He said that the monoclonal antibodies infusion they recommend you didn&#39;t get the second vaccine dose until 90 days after receiving the antibodies. He got the vaccine through work, but he thinks that the (Vaccination Facility Name) provided it, they were 1B at the time for physicians to get it, so it was given through hospital employee health department. On 06Jan2021 he had two positive tests, a rapid and a send out, rapid was a molecular COVID test and the send out was a PCR, he was pretty sure both were positive. He said it was on 08Jan2021 he got the infusion of the Eli Lilly monoclonal antibodies. when he had COVID, he had no fevers, he had a cough just like a cold, and the only reaction he had from getting the vaccine was his arm was sore, he did no treatment for either of these. Eli Lilly monoclonal antibodies infusion: He said that it says it is a BAM LAM IV IMAB infusion, and it was infused over an hour on Jan 8th. Caller says he has had no new medications or recent vaccinations, he had the flu shot in Aug or Sep. The event was not required the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. He hasn&#39;t had repeat tests, it has been 10 days from diagnosis and his symptoms have resolved. He also has got allergic rhinitis, so he takes three nasal sprays and Montelukast, medication came in an orange pharmacy. He took generic levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 75mcg for his borderline thyroid. He took Levothyroxine 88mcg, they upped it. Levothyroxine NDC: 65862-57490, LOT: 57420095A1, EXP: Jul2023. Not any pre-existing diseases worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection. The patient hadn&#39;t been treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 PCR test: positive on 06Jan2021, COVID-19 molecular test: positive on 06Jan2021. The outcome of events for covid-19 molecular test: positive/covid-19 PCR test: positive was resolved in Jan2021, for other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of COVID-19,  suspected LOE and other events  due to temporal relationship.

A 68-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 15:30 at single dose in the upper left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included back disorder and is waiting for back surgery, high blood pressure, and very likely diabetic. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon, didn&#39;t notice anything until Saturday. On Saturday afternoon (23Jan2021) he had a couple severe/serious episodes of shortness of breath. He has no other symptoms. It was better on Sunday and is better today but he still feels uncomfortable on Jan2021. He bought a oximeter today and while at rest he is at 94 but when he gets up to do anything it goes to 80. He doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the vaccine but wants to know where the shortness of breath is coming from, if it is a side effect. The vaccine was administered on 19Jan2021. He has been very inactive and is waiting for back surgery that has been put off due COVID, the hospital delayed the surgery. He is very likely diabetic and takes one pill a day for this. He also has high blood pressure but is controlled and normal range is 120/70. It was elevated along with his heart rate (on Jan2021) with the bad breathing or shortness of breath episodes. He is trying to get surgical clearance and so he had an echocardiogram the Monday before the vaccine was given and a stress test on the Thursday prior to that. It was given in the upper left arm, he also has a little bruise that is still there now (Jan2021). It was given about 3:30pm. No treatment received. Event outcome of shortness of breath was not recovered, of others was unknown.

                                                12 hours following the injection I developed a severe anaphylactic reaction including extreme swelling of lips, tongue, soft palate; difficulty breathing when reclined; difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking coherently. My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

                                                Patient was in to receive his second dose of the COVID vaccine. He reported no known issues after his first dose and remained in the pharmacy for the recommended 15 minute observation period following the vaccine without any problems. He reported to us today that around 45 minutes after having received the vaccine, he started to have a choking episode, something that he commonly experiences with his Parkinson&#39;s Disease, so he and his wife didn&#39;t think much of it. This seemed to evolve into nausea and dry heaves with excess mucus production that lasted for hours. Because of the duration, they decided to contact his insurance company&#39;s nurse line who recommended he go to the Emergency Department to rule out COVID and pneumonia  He was admitted to the ED and ultimately found to be negative for both COVID and pneumonia, at which point they decided that his Parkinson&#39;s exacerbation might have been the result of having received the vaccine. He has since been discharged and is doing well.

                                                done in his left arm, and it was a little sore; slight headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number and expiration date were not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 04Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies: dust, pollen, grass, and trees. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He received first shot on 04Jan2021, 5 days ago. He has had no bad reactions. He was happy to report. He then stated it was done in his left arm, and it was a little sore. He also had a slight headache that first evening which was unusual for him. So far so good. He was due for his regular allergy shot which he generally gets every 2-3 weeks for dust, pollen, grass, and trees. He lived in (City) and has pretty good allergies. It is said on the allergy shot not to have a flu shot within 72 hours of getting the allergy shot, so he was just wondering if it will be safe for him to have the allergy shot within approximately 120 hours of receiving the Pfizer COVID vaccine. &#34;Is it safe or advisable to have his allergy shot done today when it has only been 5 days since getting the COVID vaccine? Is he putting himself at any kind of risk?&#34; He did not have the name of the allergy shot to provide. He said it is just an injection of a little bit of the allergen. He is not a health provider. He was on the early receiving end of the vaccine because he was a hospital volunteer and works in PACU. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Narrative:  Patient seen in ED 1-17-21 with c/c of &#34;bloated with epigastric pain&#34;. Patient with complicated medical history including stage 1B pancreatic cancer (was currently on chemotherapy mFOLFIRINOX), and a leadless permanent pacemaker implantation on 1-11-21 for long episodes of SR with complete heart block following symptoms of syncope (other cardiac history: CAD s/p CABG 2009, PAF, and HTN). Regarding ER visit for epigastric pain, nothing notable was found on workup and patient was to discharge home to rest. There were available doses of COVID-19 Vaccine following a vaccine clinic that same day, and patient was offered and agreed to a dose of vaccine. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes post vaccine with no notable issues. The following day, Monday 1-18-21, patient&#39;s caregiver called facility at 22:30 to report he had a fever of 102.8 degrees and that he had been &#34;feeling kind of bad all day&#34;. Patient was advise to seek urgent medical care and reported back to ED on 1-19-21 at 00:55. Patient wasd admitted for SIRS (tachycardia and febrile) -- patient also reported diffuse myalgia. WBC WNL, CXR unremarkable for infection, UA neg for bacteria, LFTs WNL, blood cultures negative. Procalcitonin elevated at 17.8 -- suggesting inflammatory response. Patient initially reported feeling better on the morning of 1-19-21, but around 13:00 began rapidly declining (confusion, unable to walk) and started experiencing EKG changes (9 beats of SVT). Patient then coded and resuscitation was attempted for approximately 30 minutes. Patient did not survive the code. Coroner has been notified and family is considering autopsy at time of this report.

                                                Patient with multiple co-morbidities including Gastroesophageal cancer presented to the ER after he spiked a fever of 100.8 F. Admitted with concern for drain displacement and fever on 1/7/21. The patient remained afebrile overnight. Imaging was evaluated by IR and the fluid collection was deemed to minimal to warrant intervention. Surgery evaluated the patient and concluded that no acute intervention was necessary. It is most likely that the patient&#39;s fever was a reaction to administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.  The patient was deemed stable for discharge on 1/8 and sent home on 5-day course of antibiotics.

A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine &#34;seems like it isn&#39;t working&#34;. The patient stated it doesn&#39;t look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor&#39;s arms are so sore and &#39;blah blah&#39; and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn&#39;t feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn&#39;t know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven&#39;t been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn&#39;t normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn&#39;t immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn&#39;t been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and &#39;on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%&#39; was recovering, &#39;when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain&#39; was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

Started cefpodoxime x 3 days, further work up included chest xray with no findings on 1/11/21 and a chest CT on 1/13/21 with large lower lobe consolidation. He was directly admitted on 1/13/21 for pulmonary abscess. On admission he had leukocytosis and fever of 103. Workup did not identify an infectious cause but raised concerns for an auto immune cause such as Wegener Granulomatosis. Remained febrile for about 14 days

By 10:30pm was shivering with temperature of 101 fahrenheit, headache, sinus congestion with clear liquid running out of nose and nausea. Took two acetaminophen at 11:00 pm. About two hours later, nose stopped running and just had nasal drip. Could not sleep. At 3:30 am  (Tuesday morning) nausea subsided. At 10:00 a,m Tuesday still in bed but felt better. Checked temperature and still 101. Continued to take acetaminophen every six hours as recommended. Checked temperature  in the afternnon and it was 99. Checked temperature again at 9:00 pm before going to bed  and it was exactly 98.6.  Decided not to take more acetaminophen. Got up around 3:00 am (Wednesday morning) to use restroom and  checked temperature. It was 100.2. Took two acetaminophen and went to bed. That was the last time I registered an elevated temperature. Still feel weak and tired six days later.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9264 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a clinic (vaccination clinic at county government center) and not received in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetic (watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago), overweight (probably 10 lbs), cholesterol (abnormal), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which was probably 10 lbs overweight. The patient was told that he has borderline diabetic watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago. Concomitant medication included pravastatin from Aug2020 and ongoing for cholesterol. The patient did not receive other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 29Jan2021 after the vaccine was administered, the patient was real tired, kind of felt weak and right arm was sore which he expected. The patient went to bed early about 20:30 and slept solid until 30Jan2021 07:00; like he did not know anything was going on while he slept. On 30Jan2021, he got up and he wasn&#39;t really tired, but he was really kind of numb, like he could not get his faculties together. The patient informed that after about 3 cups of coffee later that day on 30Jan2021, he got kind of sick in afternoon. The patient was really tired, had chills, thinks he had a light or mild fever, was sweating, had some pretty good stomach cramps that felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t which lasted about 4 hours (30Jan2021). The patient&#39;s face did feel flushed a little bit on 30Jan2021. The patient thought he would have to go to the hospital for a time, but he waited it out and got better. The patient went to bed again early that day. On 31Jan2021, the patient felt better, but again not a lot of energy (pending clarification, also reported date 30-MAR-1871) probably because he had not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine on 29Jan2021. The patient still has a little lack of energy yet, but that could be because he did not eat a whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine. The patient informed that he had no swelling in his arm or anything, he was thinking that he survived. The patient was back to feeling pretty good again today. The patient thought that the vaccine was going to work. The events did not require emergency room/physician visit. The patient did not provide information with the primary/prescriber. The patient&#39;s second dose was on 19Feb2021. The outcome of the events stomach cramps, felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t was recovered on 30Jan2021, not a lot of energy/little lack of energy, not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine/whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine was recovering, while unknown for the rest of the events.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

He received a 10 day course of doxycycline for CAP as an outpatient without any improvement, hence he was admitted to the hospital for further workup.

He was admitted to hospital on 3/16 for acute stroke workup given his VERY CLEAR Facial droop, slurred speech. His CT  Head was negative for acute bleed and his MRI Brain was negative for any acute stroke. He was seen by Neurologist while inpatient and was determined to have Bell Palsy and NOT an acute or subacute stroke.   Prior to taking the vaccine, he had NO facial droop. After taking the vaccine, he received no new medications nor did he travel to any other places. Additionally, he lives in a city and has not been hiking in the woods.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                After my first vaccine (EK5730--on 12/26/20), I had absolutely NO reactions. The second one was quite a different matter.   14 hours after the shot, I developed shaking chills. The next day I had myalgias and arthralgias pretty much all over. It was that &#34;run over by a truck&#34; feeling of the flu. Headache, fatigue followed. Appetite was down. No fever.   Slept for many hours.   Now in my third day after the vaccine and not feeling better.   Still, I remain grateful that I was immunized and am taking the optimistic spin that this kind of intense reaction shows my immune system is responding strongly and nicely to the vaccine.  It is miserable though, particularly since the first one was so benign.   I am a family doctor (MD) and am torn between discussing this in my weekly health column which may dissuade patients, some already on the fence, from getting vaccinated. I saw the FDA info confirming higher incidence of side effects with second shot, which was definitely the case with me.

A 71-years-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), lot EL3246 , unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:10 (at the age of 71-years old) as a SINGLE DOSE given in left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing vertigo, ongoing dizziness, ongoing balance problems, ongoing vision problems, ongoing stomach problems, he lost 80lbs in a year, but his weight is starting to go back up. He has had bad health for the last 3 years. He goes to the doctors all the time. In fact, he just went to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) to find out what was going on. He has had dizziness quite often, so there are days where he just don&#39;t feel good but, he thinks it has something to do with his eyes. When he feels bad, he will lay down and close his eyes, and all of his problems go away. He went to see a retina specialist because of his continuing vision problems. The ENT doctor told him he can&#39;t help him. Concomitant medications included 6 different medications.  The patient experienced side effects after getting the first dose of the vaccine. He got the first dose a week ago and he said that he experienced nausea, feeling unwell, chills and diarrhea. The patient experienced nausea, feeling unwell, chills in Jan2021 and diarrhea on 26Jan2021. He had his shot a week ago tomorrow. He was up all night last night with diarrhea, he was up probably up 10 times. He was supposed to go in to get his teeth pulled today, but he just can&#39;t do it. He does have some chills and nausea. He is feeling unwell. He supposed that he is dehydrated in Jan2021. The diarrhea just started last night, 26Jan2021. He got up about 6:15 this morning and that was the last time he had diarrhea. He still has nausea, but he hasn&#39;t had any other diarrhea. He has some nausea from the time to time. He doesn&#39;t have any COVID symptoms that he can tell. He is feeling unwell, and has the nausea and chills, but he does not have any fever. He hasn&#39;t had a fever and he can still smell and taste and all of that stuff. One thing he did notice after he got his COVID-19 shot was that he did not have any symptoms of any kind. He never had pain in his arm, nothing. He received the vaccine on 21Jan2021, and he never felt a thing or anything that would associate with the shot. The consumer doesn&#39;t know if what he is going through is caused by the shot or not. Outcome of the events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the second (husband) of two reports. A 71-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date) at vaccination age of 71-year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 at a single dose for didn&#39;t want to get COVID (covid-19 immunization). The patient&#39;s no medical history and concomitant medications. The wife reported that they both received their first dose for the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 27Jan2021 and since then they have experienced &#34;major side effects, chills, headaches, sore throat, major cough, fatigue&#34; that was just unbelievable and both of them are exhausted on 27Jan2021. She further stated that they both got sick: had a major headache, cough, and chills. She mentioned that the major headache started as soon... he went back to work, and said he is not feeling well so he came home, and he hopped in bed. He got under the covers around 4PM and he had a low-grade fever, it was nothing, a little bit, and her went to bed and then he said he had a headache, his happened immediately. He also had chills on the same day and had the cough immediately. She added that the headache has gone away which lasted like one day, his cough was ongoing though improving, but he still has one. Chills went away, they lasted a couple days, he has recovered completely. She reported that what was unusual, she was looking at side effects, but he had a major sore throat that started that day (27Jan2021) and he still has it somewhat, but it has gotten better. He has somewhat of one, because he said to her on Saturday (30Jan2021), he said he is going to go to Patient First, that he thought he had strep, his throat is sore, and she said ok. She didn&#39;t think he had it thought it was that coughing irritated his throat (she played doctor) but he said no, he was going to go to make sure he had no strep. She agreed so he went to a facility there, but they wouldn&#39;t allow him in the door because he said he thought he had strep, but they said he couldn&#39;t get treated there so they sent him home. They said he didn&#39;t have it, he thought he did, he was given a test (unknown results), they said he didn&#39;t have it, and he woke up this morning, it&#39;s like when you get up in morning, but it has subsided. He doesn&#39;t have strep; he went to the facility to see if they could tell him. She also reported that they are both so fatigued and so tired. She mentioned that her husband&#39;s second dose is scheduled for 20Feb2021. She inquired if this was after the first dose, what&#39;s going to happen after the second dose. She wanted to know if she and her husband can take the second dose, scheduled on 17Feb2021. The outcome of the event chills was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021, as for the events fever, fatigue and feeling unwell were unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovering.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

This morning the pain has dropped to my right buttock and is radiating down my right leg; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 71-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Feb2021 (at the age of 71-years-old), for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were no concomitant medications and no other vaccine was administered on the same date. Exactly one week after the injection, on 17Feb2021, the patient began having routine symptoms including weakness, tiredness, and chills. The unusual and unexpected symptom was a right flank pain that seemed to be over the right kidney. According to the patient, it seemed to be muscular, so he dismissed it. On the morning of 21Feb2021, the pain had dropped to his right buttock and was radiating down his right leg. The patient also reported a weakness in his right leg and that his right leg had buckled a couple times this morning (21Feb2021). The patient did not receive treatment for weakness, tiredness, chills, right flank pain, muscular (pain), pain had dropped to his right buttock and was radiating down right leg, weakness in right leg, and right leg had buckled. The clinical outcome of weakness, tiredness, chills, right flank pain, muscular (pain), pain had dropped to his right buttock and was radiating down right leg, weakness in right leg, and right leg had buckled was not recovered.

I think people should be told that they could have a reaction so they do not plan anything important the following day, but they should still get the vaccine. The day following the reaction I felt perfect.

                                                Patient expired. Per Emergency MD note: &#34;This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.&#34;

This consumer reported for a 72-year-old male patient (husband) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 08:00 at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 prevention. The medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the shot on 19Jan2021. Since Jan2021, his arm was still sore, but he had been nauseated since then. He has no energy. He has had it almost four days. He was fine until he got it and his arm is sore and he is nauseated. He is usually on the go. The patient also has an inflamed liver. He has been sick since. The patient has no appetite, he is sweating, his bones are hurting, and he is tired. The consumer took her husband to his doctor, and they tested him for COVID, and it came back negative, but the consumer does not think the PA did the test right. The consumer doesn&#39;t know what to do with him, because he is still tired, and has no appetite. The patient is breaking out in cold chills, and his bones are still sore. When the patient got the vaccine, he was walking and talking, and by 11 AM that day, he was in bed. The patient had some labs done, and was being told that his liver is big, so the consumer did not know if the vaccine went to his liver. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                very sick/high fever/get weaker/diagnosed with double pneumonia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife).  A 72-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot # EL3247, intramuscular in left arm on 15Jan2021 (at 1500 or 1600) at single dose to prevent covid. There were no relevant medical history or concomitant medications. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2. There was no prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The reporter stated on 16Jan2021 the patient got very very sick. He started running a fever, a high fever a high temperature all day on 16Jan2021 through 17Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night the reporter took him to the emergency room and they said it was from the covid shot. The patient began to get weaker on 17Jan2021 (not resolved) and still with a fever (resolved in Jan2021) and they said it was the shot. They went to a walk in clinic where they did a covid test on 17Jan2021 which was negative and they gave him medicine for possible pneumonia. But he didn&#39;t get any better. They went to another clinic where he had 3 more tests on 17Jan2021, &#34;a covid test, a throat culture/ strep test and a flu test that all came back negative&#34;. On 18Jan2021 his family doctor advised him to go the hospital and he was diagnosed with double pneumonia which was resolving. The reporter stated that the event required a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The reporter wanted to know if he will be able to get the second shot and asking if the first dose of the covid vaccine give him pneumonia. The medicine they gave him did not seem to be doing a lot of good, he was admitted for 3 days last week (since Jan2021 to Jan2021) and he received iv antibiotics. The medicine that was not doing good she clarified was oral pills of azithromycin (Lot: KJ9712, Expiration: Jan2022. NDC: 0781808926)that was to be taken at home. The outcome of the event was not resolved.

Each attack lasted 15 to 25 minutes, and seemed to be alleviated by taking anti-acid (simethicone) pills. Quite likely related the vaccine: 11 days after the vaccine was administered, I experienced a rather severe headache, plus slight general weakness, and a raised temperature of between 98.9 and 100.4 degrees. The first 10 days I had discerned no adverse effects. This has lasted16 hours so far, with little alleviation.

                                                Pulmonary embolism; Multiple clots in his lungs; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife). A 72-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number unknown and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.

On 19Jan2021, she and her husband had the first shot, the Pfizer Covid shot. On 10Feb2021, they had the second shot. Just today she picked her husband from the hospital, they dismissed him for today because on 18Feb2021, she had to take him to emergency room because he had pulmonary embolism. He has multiple clots in his lungs. This is nothing that they dealt before with him. The reporter is afraid that it might be related to have taken the vaccine. Reporter stated that when she took him to the emergency room, it was 18Feb2021. Now he had a little shortness of breath for few days before the 18th but they didn&#39;t realize that he was having a big problem. He fully developed this on 18Feb2021. The reason for hospitalization was pulmonary embolism and blood clots in his lungs. He is little bit slow like the reporter said she got him to the hospital where he stayed 3 days she guess with pulmonary embolism, from 18Feb2021 to 21Feb2021. He had lot a of lab work while he was in hospital on these days the wife described. He had blood work, Echocardiogram, CAT scan, Ultrasounds, Chest X-ray, Covid rapid test, they haven&#39;t got back the result yet. Outcome of the events was unknown.

This consumer reported similar event for 3 patients (for herself, her husband and their doctor). This is 1st of three reports (husband case) and only this case is serious. A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure abnormal; both from 2007 and ongoing; about 13-14 years, he does not take insulin, he takes oral medication. The consumer is calling for her husband who is in the hospital. His symptoms started after Covid 19 injection. He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

Two days after BNT162B2 (14Jan2021 14:00), patient had a loss of vision in left eye that lasted for about three minutes and had a dizzy sell that lasted for forty-five minutes after getting out of the hot tub. It was unknown if treatment was received for the events. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Doctors had no explanation at this time and had no idea if it was related to the injection. Outcome of the events was resolved on 14Jan2021.

A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included heart rate irregular and blood pressure high. Concomitant medications were none. The patient said he had an irregular heartbeat after getting his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021. He said he had to go to the Emergency Room on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He clarified he checked his blood pressure at home and his blood pressure was low at 91/73. He said he also had a high pulse rate of 160, or better, for 9-1/2 hours. He said the only thing he can attribute his low blood pressure and high pulse rate to is the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he hasn&#39;t heard anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine being related to having an effect on the heart, but he personally believes it was his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose that caused his low blood pressure and high pulse rate. He clarified after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021, he had a sore right arm after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, fatigue, tiredness, and nausea. He said on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he recognized a small amount of chills, feeling feverish without having a fever, and sweating. He said his wife checked his temperature a few times on Saturday, 30Jan2021, and he never had a fever, but he felt clammy. He said he had noticed the nausea more than anything else. He said he maybe should have checked his blood pressure on Saturday, 30Jan2021. He said he didn&#39;t check his blood pressure until Sunday morning, 31Jan2021, and when he saw his low blood pressure and high pulse rate, he called the hospital and eventually drove to the Emergency Room. He said by the time he had got to the Emergency Room his blood pressure had went up to &#34;100 and something&#34;, but his pulse rate never changed, and his pulse was still 160. He said the doctor gave him several medications to try to get his pulse rate to come down. He said the doctor had given him a medication that was supposed to bring his pulse down. He said then the doctor had to add something else in a syringe to go with the other medication to bring his pulse down. He said he wasn&#39;t sure of the medication&#39;s name. He clarified he never noticed his pulse rate was high until he took his blood pressure on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he felt the nausea start later Friday evening (29Jan2021). He said he already has stomach trouble anyways that he takes medicine for, so he took a pill, but the nausea continued. He clarified he took 1 Omeprazole 20mg capsule that was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, but stated the Omeprazole 20mg prescription looked like it expired in 2017. He said he knows he has a newer Omeprazole prescription, but did not know where the prescription bottle was. He reported on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he just laid around. He said he did not feel as bad on Saturday, as he did on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he called the Emergency Room on Sunday morning, and went to the Emergency Room. He said he didn&#39;t feel his 160 pulse rate. He said he was told by the doctor in the Emergency Room that his fast heart rate had his heart beating like he was having a stress test. He reported he doesn&#39;t know if he wants to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot after what he experienced this past weekend. He reported he only takes blood pressure medicine that he has  been on for a while. He reported he had several EKGs done on Sunday, 31Jan2021, while he was in the Emergency Room. He said the EKG showed Atrial Fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 160s. He reported while he was in the Emergency Room he was given IV Heparin, IV Potassium, Potassium pills, and Amiodarone in a pill and IV form. He said the doctor added another IV medicine in a syringe, but he doesn&#39;t know the name of the medicine. He said the doctor also gave him IV Morphine because he had pain in his chest. He said the doctor said his chest pain was being caused by his heart trying to go back into a regular rhythm.  He reported he was in the Emergency Room for 11-12 hours before he was admitted to the hospital. He said his pulse rate wasn&#39;t coming down and stayed at 160 for 9-1/2 hours. He said the doctor wanted to admit him to the hospital, so he could have a procedure to make sure the high pulse rate didn&#39;t damage his heart. He said on Monday, 01Feb2021, he had a procedure where they went through his wrist and put a dye in his heart to see if the stress from his high pulse rate damaged his heart. He said his heart wasn&#39;t damaged, so he was discharged from the hospital later in the day on 01Feb2021. He clarified his blood pressure was good by the time the first or second EKG was performed in the Emergency Room. He clarified he already had an issue with sweating before he received his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he is still sweating, but he doesn&#39;t know if that is because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical outcome of high pulse rate and blood pressure low was recovered on 31Jan2021; nausea, fatigue/tiredness recovered on 02Feb2021; chills, feeling feverish recovered on an unspecified date; sweating was not recovered; while for the other events was unknown.

Three days following the first dose, I started to experience hematuria as well as constipation. It has happened before as a result of radiation treatment back in 2005/2006. Saw my urologist on 02/02/2021, and  had several tests, ruling out any return of cancer. Antibiotics improved the situation, which was getting closer to normal prior to getting the second dose. Again, three days following the second dose, hematuria returned and still prevails at various degrees. Also experience fatigue and weight loss.

He had a lack of concentration for more than a week that lasted 2-3 weeks.  Diarrhea 9 days after the vaccine that lasted for about a week.  General tiredness for about 2 weeks.  2 weeks and 2 days after vaccine had high BP, and it&#39;s better today at his APT.

He also has had itching on the top of his feet and ankles that did not start until after the vaccine, and still has depending on what socks he&#39;s wearing.   He also had a swollen right ear that was real sore and had to go to the doctor to get the swelling down using some ear drops.

I DID NOT REALIZE THAT TIREDNESS, MUSCLE PAIN, JOINT PAIN AND FEELING UNWELL ALONG WITH DIZZINESS AND WEAKNESS  WERE SYMPTOMS OF A POSSIBLE REACTION TO THE VACCINE. SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMS COULD BE FROM A PREVIOUS STROKE.

The patient had his second COVID-19 Vaccine yesterday, 21Feb2021 and had a significant reaction. Last night (21Feb2021), about 12 hours later, he started getting a headache, he was breathing really fast, and shivering. He tried to calm himself down and went to bed. This morning (22Feb2021) he got up around 7AM and still wasn&#39;t feeling too well. His temperature was slightly elevated at 98.9 on 22Feb2021. His normal temperature is 97.1. He knows his own body and was pretty convinced his reaction was from a slightly elevated temperature and everything that comes with that. He went back to bed this morning and slept until 11:30AM. He got up and felt good. He took his temperature a few minutes ago and it was back to 97.1.

A 73-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 17Feb2021 03:00 (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2008 and ongoing and reported that it&#39;s under control. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient was calling because he got his shot through the (facility name withheld) on the 17Feb2021 around 3:00. The caller goes for walks, and one week later he had a blackout, about the same time he got the shot 3:00 or 3:15 on 24Feb2021. The caller blacked out and he broke his glasses, scraped his face, all that stuff. All the scrapes were healing. The weirdest thing was it happened almost exactly a week later. The caller asked was it possible that this could be related to the vaccine. For the following two days after the vaccine the caller had 2 light headaches on 18Feb2021 and then they were gone on 19Feb2021. This blackout event happened one time. Caller mentioned the headaches were nothing to be concerned about. The caller was not given a vaccination card at the (facility name withheld) and does not know the lot number, NDC number, or expiration date. This was the caller&#39;s first dose of the vaccine. The caller mentioned that 11Mar2021 was his next appointment for the second dose of the vaccine. The caller has never had a black out episode or dizziness before. The caller said he licked his wounds and will be okay. No visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office required. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No relevant tests done. The outcome was recovered on 19Feb2021 for the event Headache; and recovering for the other events.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Dec2020 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He was an ER doctor and the medical director of his hospital. The patient was asymptomatic when he got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. 3 hours after the vaccine he began to get chills, HA, anorexia, myalgias, and extreme fatigue. This worsened and he slept all and had no appetite. On 19Dec2020 he woke up delirious with a fever and was ataxic, hypoxic, incontinent, and confused. The patient was hospitalized due to the events on 15Dec2020. The events also caused prolonged hospitalization due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab post vaccination with unknown results. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as the patient required oxygen, plasma, and remdisivir.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, BNT162B2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of reported serious events might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  Fever, chills, headache, fatigue and muscle pain are the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  More information such as detailed underlying medical conditions and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

He  was given 0.3 mls of the vaccine IM in the left deltoid.at 2:40 pm.  He pulled around to the observation area and at 3:12 pm.   He reported that he was experiencing tightness in his chest, dizziness and SOB.  Sp02 was 97% on RA.  HR was 57.  Oxygen applied via non-rebreather mask at 6L .  Sp02 went up to 100%.  At 3:05 patient reports that his chest tightness was feeling better and reported that it was easier to breathe.  He denies any numbness or dizziness.  Sp02 was 98% at this time.  BP was 138/84.  At 3:12 patient reports that the tightness in his chest has subsided and that he was &#34;feeling better&#34;.  Sp02 was turned off.  After observing patient for several minutes she was found to be in stable condition to leave the observation unit.  He was agreeable to this plan.  He will notify her PCP with any further symptoms.

Never had a fever. All of a sudden, around 2:30PM all dissipated, it was all gone and I was fine. A week later I called my PCP because the symptoms came back - the lethargy. He suggested me to go to the ER. I went and could barely write my name on the sign in sheet at the hospital. They did 5 COVID tests and 4 of them were negative. I was at the ER for 3 days and finally was admitted and stayed for 11 days.  I was sent home with oxygen and my levels are finally getting back to 92/93.  I can&#39;t walk at this time. I lost 17 lbs and if I try to walk my lungs shut down.

Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

This 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular at right arm on 12Jan2021 15:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetic diagnosed about 5 years ago or longer, had COVID back in Nov2020, he was in the hospital for 3 days with pneumonia and was sent home and he could not keep his oxygen levels up, then he was put on oxygen and he just got off oxygen 2 weeks ago. Concomitant medication included ongoing Metformin for diabetes for years. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional vaccines administered on same date. The patient received the first dose of Pfizer covid vaccine on 12Jan2021 and had a reaction. His pain started around 12:30 to 1am last night (13Jan2021). He took Aleve this morning for the pain. The pain is now getting close to where he would have to take another Aleve. The pain was probably getting worse. He started experiencing dizziness on 13Jan2021 afternoon and he cannot walk safely, the doctor is aware. He will try to get to the bedroom to get in bed. The outcome of events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 15Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from two contactable consumers (patient&#39;s wife and patient) via a Pfizer-sponsored program, Pfizer First Connect. This consumer (patient&#39;s wife) reported similar events for two patients. This is the second of two reports.    A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EH9899, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a clinic. Medical history included prostate cancer, off rapid radiation (over two years ago by robotic surgery. He followed all the recommendations for rapid off radiation, no side effects. He took hormone therapy. He is cured), acid reflux, allergies (takes antihistamine when allergies act up; his allergies blossomed because of the leaves), and he used to be five nine, but he shrunk a little. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), losartan, pantoprazole for he had a bout with acid reflux, and tadalafil.  The patient&#39;s wife and the patient both received the COVID-19 vaccine on 04Jan2021 and stated they have a mild case; they did not have any severe symptoms of the COVID and did not have a fever. The patient&#39;s oxygen level was normal. The patient&#39;s wife confirmed that she and her husband both had the vaccine on the same day and they both have COVID. The patient got a cough and was going to go the (clinic name). They went there and had lungs checked. Their lungs were clear and oxygen level was good. They both have been tested a few times. The patient&#39;s wife and the husband quarantined for two weeks and test were negative. When they were there this past Monday, they were asked if they wanted to be tested. They both got the results on Wednesday and were shocked; they were now quarantining again. COVID testing was done on 11Jan2021 and got the positive results on 13Jan2021. The patient&#39;s wife and the husband gave them a card, for when to come back. It was given at a drive through clinic in (county name). The patient feels fine and is sleeping well.  The patient recovered from the event in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021045610 same reporter/drug, similar events in different patients

The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat.

She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time.

The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021.

He got it on 19Jan2021. He had COVID before. Last summer he hadn&#39;t left the house for 20 plus weeks and their son who was living with them brought the COVID virus in to them. His son and wife were asymptomatic and suffered at the house and he was completely disabled, with underlying conditions had to drag himself to the facility. He eventually had to be hospitalized on 21Jul2020. He had blood plasma and remdesivir and stayed in the hospital from Tuesday through Sunday. After getting the treatment, he felt like superman. On 20Jan2021, he next day, about 24 hours later he started feeling sick again, he felt like when he had COVID back in Jul2020. It lasted for 24 hours, terrible headache, chills, aches, and a little diarrhea. He said after he got the vaccine, 24 hours later, his arm got sorer and sorer. He had 99.9 F fever and a terrible headache. He also put on a little weight on an unspecified date. No emergency room visit. No relevant tests. He called the facility the next morning and they told him to rest. He slept all day and the next day he felt like superman again. He called the facility that Thursday morning and they instructed him to relax and that it seemed to affect people who have had the COVID virus before, they have that reaction, and it should subside and it did. He stated his side effects were about 20% of what they were when he actually had COVID. The clinic told him that if he had any reaction to call and that Thursday he just relaxed. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. Never had any problems with shots, not really. He remembered when he went to specific area they gave him a whole bunch of shots with these guns and he was just sore a couple days, but that was it, no big deal. The patient underwent lab test which included COVID-19 positive Jul2020. The outcome of feeling sick, headache, chills, ache, diarrhea was recovering while outcome of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021107344 Same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

Had a blood clot--Portal Vein Thrombosis.  Put on Heparin drip in hospital...and Eliquis blood thinners after released.  I have never been sick like that...never been on any prescription...always been healthy, walking 3-5 miles per day.   My family feels that there must be a connection with the vaccine.  One of my doctors said no...another said didn&#39;t think so, but unknown at this time.

                                                I awoke at 0345 on 9 January and felt nauseated.  I got up and went to the bathroom and vomited.  I then vomited 1 hour later and then every 30-60 minutes for the next 12 hours.  After the first 4 episodes of emesis, I was only vomiting bile.  I felt wiped out and very weak and slept when I wasn&#39;t vomiting.  On the 10th, I had generalized muscle aches but no more vomiting.  On the 11th, I am finally feeling better but not really normal yet.

He has been directed to take Tylenol and if symptoms persist to F/U with his PCP and keep me informed. He has been given VAERs website for adverse reactions in the future. I have explained that his headache could be a side effect of the vaccine; however, if his symptoms worsen to seek additional medical evaluation.

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

I revived and was taken to the hospital, and treated for 2 1/2 days with heart catheterization and TPA injected into my clot in the pulmonary arteries with good resolution. I did have cor pulmonale with acute severe right heart failure as part of that, Dr. thought the clot came from my right calf by his examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by CAT scan cardiac Echo and right heart catheterization.
