                                                Myalgias starting within 1 hour after vaccination, worsened throughout day that radiated to ipsilateral trapezius and rhomboid areas.  Starting around 16 hours after vaccination, severe subjective fevers and chills with severe headache that worsened with lying down. The headache was the most concerning symptom with tinnitus when laying flat in supine. It awoke me from sleep and prevented me from laying flat so I had to sleep upright on the couch. I took tylenol 500mg around 0200 and was able to sleep for a few hours. By 24 hours post vaccine, the headache and fevers/chills significantly improved so I could attend work the next day.

In the evening hours, symptoms were pretty much gone. I took 650mg acetaminohen x2 again. On the following day after onset of symptoms, no symptoms were noted. Symptoms, in my opinion, were out of proportion to what has been described as average in the literature and what seem to be the common side effects of peers who have received the same vaccine.

A 26-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EK9231; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 20:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. He received his first dose (age of vaccination was 26-year-old) of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EH9899; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s family history included his father has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine in a university hospital which set up a clinic. The patient reported that he thought he got his second dose last night at about 8 pm and since then in the morning around 8 am, so about 12 hours after he started having flu like symptoms that got pretty bad one point. He took some acetaminophen (TYLENOL) so it has gotten better but he was having myalgia, headache, fever, chills and nausea. The patient further mentioned that first, he started having chills around 8 am in the morning. He had chills before but now he kind of overheated and now he is not under a blanket anymore, so he thinks that is improved. He then started having nausea, then myalgia and then everything kind of got bad all at once. He mentioned that over all everything has improved except the headache. He further added that everything has not gone away complete but improved significantly. Earlier today (14Jan2021) like 2-3 hours ago he would say it was a 7 or 8 on a scale of 0-10 but right now it is about 4 on a scale of 0-10 and that goes for everything. He does not think anything else is confounding, he is not on any medications and has no chronic health problems, there has been no labs drawn. The patient did not visit an emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the outcome of the event headache was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovering.

                                                I took notes during my wait time: -6 minutes in my throat felt weird, but different than normal allergic reactions to foods. I prepared my Epi-Pen so I have easier access at this time. -9 minutes in the sides of my tongue were slightly itchy. -11 minutes in and I felt as though the saliva in the back of my throat was thicker and I needed to clear my throat a bit more often, similar to allergic reactions. -15 minutes in, I felt my heart pound once out of beat, but my heart rhythm returned to normal immediately. Tongue itchiness also became intermittent rather than constant. -18 minutes in, overall condition improved and I felt better. -22 minutes in, my throat felt scratchy like I would if I consumed legumes (chickpeas, green peas, soy beans, etc.) but also oddly warm, which was out of the norm.  No treatments needed given mild reactions. I went to work, but notified my co-workers of my reaction, so if my condition worsens they can help administer my Epi-Pen. I am reporting this at 9:21 am on 03/05/2021, roughly an hour after my first dose.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly in unknown arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for routine mass immunizations (covid-19 immunization). The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Not a military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none and concomitant medications was none (he was on no other medications). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced tachycardia, intermittent palpitations, low grade fever/fever all started somewhere in the morning of 18Dec2020 and muscle aches on 17Dec2020. Physician assessed tachycardia and intermittent palpitations as serious due to medically significant. Physician stated that one of his workers had the vaccine and proceeded to have tachycardia and low grade fever. He would like to know if patient should get the second dose. The patient had mostly tachycardia with some intermittent palpitations. Patient was seen in his office on 18Dec2020, and got the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020. He also reported fever and muscle aches, although the fever was subjective and was not documented. Tachycardia improved and sent him to cardiology on 21Dec2020. It was not life threatening and they did an Electrocardiogram (EKG). His initial heart rate was 130. When he was seen again in their office on 21Dec2020, it was 93, which was baseline. It improved. He never got his temperature. The highest in office was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He had some muscle aches. The physician just sent patient to cardiology because he was having intermittent tachycardia and intermittent palpitations. Two visits to physician office. He was seen on 18Dec2020 and again on 21Dec2020. Relevant tests: they did testing for tachycardia but not related specifically. They did thyroid and EKG in office and he did not know if test were back. EKG was ok. The Thyroid, Complete blood count (CBC) and lipid (all were on an unknown date in Dec2020) were not back and were just done to make sure there were no cardiac issues. The outcome of the events was recovering. The lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events tachycardia and palpitations cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                I would like to start out by saying that I am well aware that this vaccine is known to cause side effects and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any side effects induced by it. The reason I am writing this is to provide information that you all can keep in mind as you provide guidance on your recommendations for the timing of when the vaccine should be administered to those who have already tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID-19 11 days prior to getting vaccinated. My symptoms from the virus began on 12/21/20, lasted until 12/26/20 and included: mild headache, fever of 100.3, moderate muscle fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and sinus congestion. I received the Pfizer vaccine on 1/3/21 at 11am and by 2am on 1/4/21 I was experiencing a temperature of 102.5, severe headache, severe muscle fatigue, and painful right axillary lymphadenopathy. Although they had almost completely resolved by 11am on 1/4/20, I would describe these side effects to the vaccine as significantly worse than the symptoms of the virus itself. As someone who has a stronger medical background than the general public (I am a 4th year dental student in a patient-facing role and was encouraged by my school to receive the vaccine despite already testing positive), I understood the likelihood of developing side effects to the vaccine and I am still planning on receiving my second dose in three weeks despite already showing clear signs of a strong immune response to the proteins created by the vaccine. The reason why I am writing this is because there was no guidance on recommending that I wait longer than 10 days between testing positive and receiving the vaccine and I am worried that if the general public is allowed to receive the vaccine at this same time interval, there will be a significant number of people who will have similar side effects (worse than those induced by the virus itself) and they will not only refuse a second dose, but could also vocally discourage many people from trusting the vaccine?s safety and benefit. I obviously don?t know what minimum timeframe should be recommended, but from my individual experience, 11 days was not sufficient. I will be happy to follow up if you would like to know how the symptoms fare after my second dose.

A 27-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899/expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 27Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that he got the vaccination on the 27th and then that same night he started to feel a little sick. He was assuming that it has just to be the side effect of the vaccine (unspecified vaccine). On 28Dec2020, he was feeling pretty sick; he did not go to the work. He had COVID-19 test (Dec2020) and results came back positive. He added that he didn&#39;t know if it was the COVID because he was reading up on the vaccines and it said that one could not get COVID from the vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported positive with COVID-19 test after COVID-19 immunization is considered ineffective of BNT162B2, and the Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported event and BNT162B2 administration.

                                                Approximately 57 hours after receiving 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine, I developed hive patches throughout my body. I took 50 mg Benadryl and went to bed. Work up the next morning to observe some res spots, but minimal itching. I reported to work, where I am an EMT for an ambulance service. During shift, at approximately 1500 hours, I had a patient who was cold, so I cranked up the heat in the back of the ambulance. I started to sweat. My hive then came back with a vengeance all over my body. I immediately took 50 mg Benadryl and went to the urgent care center. The doctor told me to continue with the Benadryl and to pick up a prescription of Prednisone if symptoms worsen. Symptoms where mostly cleared up at that point. I got off shift at 1900. Hive worsened at approximately 2000. I picked up the prednisone and intend to begin taking it in the morning if symptoms are not much improved.

I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

A 27-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid on 21Dec2020 13:45 at single dose for Vaccination.  There were no medical history and concomitant medications.  The patient was diagnosed with covid on 30Dec2020 with outcome of recovering.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test: positive on 30Dec2020. The patient received the first dose of the covid vaccine on 21Dec2020, and was diagnosed with covid on 30Dec2020. The patient had COVID test on 30Dec2020 and received positive result of COVID test on 31Dec2020. He was scheduled for the second dose between 08Jan2021 and 11Jan2021. He asked if he should continue to get the second dose as scheduled in relation to the diagnosis of COVID. COVID: the patient still had chest congestion, but no fever without medication, no cough anymore. He was having cough, fever, loss of taste and smell, fatigue and malaise. Reporter seriousness for COVID: Not serious. Relatedness of drug to reaction/event:  Reaction assessed: COVID, Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Global Introspection, Drug result: Unrelated. Verbatim event relatedness: Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine: COVID-Unrelated.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 21Dec2020, and was diagnosed with COVID-19 on 30Dec2020.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the diagnosed COVID-19 likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use, and unrelated to BNT162B2.

Became nauseated and then started quickly oscillating between feeling hot and cold. Sat up in bed and when he did, felt &#39;&#39;everything move to my toes&#39;&#39;. Remained conscious for about 2-3 seconds and then woke up on the floor in a pool of sweat about 5 minutes later (knows the timespan based on looking at his watch when he went to the bathroom and when he woke up). Tried to get up and felt unstable so decided to lay in the floor which he did for about another 10 minutes. During this timeframe, noticed jaw pain and soreness which he attributes to clenching his jaw. At this point, able to struggle into his bed and noted that the oscillation of hot/cold had abated and he was left with a mild headache and fatigue which has slowly improved since that time. At this time, pt reports he feels about 90% of USOH but somewhat &#39;&#39;uneasy&#39;&#39; still. Denies reaction to medication or vaccine in the past other than sulfa abx for which he had skin rashes as a child.

I am unable to think. My speech is completely off. I try to say something, but what I say is not what I was thinking. Don&#39;t you dare say I have something wrong with me, in regards to unable to articulate what I want to say, and what Is actually being said. I understand what is happening to me with this reality. Which is why this vaccine is terroristic. Im going to make it my life endeavored goal to resolve this in legal entities. For that. This is not helping anyone. Causing more pain. And. Allowing the government to lie even more. I hate this Country!

In the morning, the chills were gone, but a slight fever and body aches remained all day. They were gone by the next day.

I stumbled into the bathroom and removed my pajama shirt to relieve the heat I was experiencing. I ran my hands under luke warm water and the sensation suddenly disappeared as quickly as it came. Later that same day I experienced fatigue and loss of appetite that lasted about 24 hours.

On the morning of 1/8 I woke up with noted chills and headache.  I checked my temp and noticed 100.4* oral temp.  I also had back pain, muscle pain, headaches, continued fever (improved with motrin) and chills. My left arm from my shoulder to my wrist was with noted pain/aches, improved with motrin. On the morning of 1/9 I felt much better, did not take any motrin/tylenol and without any fever/chills.  Noted improvement of muscle aches in general and arm felt  the same as 1/7 (much better!).  Noted lymph swelling of my axillary lymph nodes with aching pain.  This has not gone away at current but improved with x1 dose of motrin.

                                                Symptoms of 2nd Covid vaccine lot EL 1284: numbness in feet, legs throbbing, muscle weakness in legs, overall tiredness  I received my second Pfizer vaccine on 1/12/21 at 12:15 pm.  After several hours, I felt weak and tired.  By 7:00 pm, I had a migraine that wouldn?t go away and I had muscle ache in my feet and legs.  On 1/13/21 I felt some numbness in my feet and my legs were throbbing.  By 10:00 pm, both of my feet were completely numb and my legs were throbbing/radiating heat.  It felt as if circulation was cut off from my feet entirely.  On 1/14/21 I went into work where I?m constantly on my feet.  I felt intense muscle weakness in my legs and thighs to point where I could barely stand up.  I immediately went to an urgent care where they started me on an Sodium Chloride 0.9% intravenous IV solution drip.  They ran blood tests and urine tests to rule out any other causes to my symptoms.  All results came back negative.  I was told to rest, hydrate, and recover for the next several days.  If my symptoms did not subside within the next couple days, I was instructed to go to the ER for further examination.

                                                At around 1:30 in the morning, i became really weak, achey, had the chills, some nausea, a minor headache, a slight sore throat, and  minor eye pain like they were dry. Though i I felt terrible, the most concerning side effect was that my skin felt like it was extremely raw in patches all over my body where if my sheets lightly touched one of those ?patches?, it would be very painful. However, there was no rash or discoloration from what I could tell. I also had strange painful sensations at the ends of my toes but were different in quality relative to the hypersensitive/raw painful sensations on my skin. The adverse events kept me awake for hours but when I finally got to sleep and woke up the next morning.  I only had chills, weakness, and acheyness which were much less in severity than those early morning hours. It is now 4:45 pm and the only adverse effect I am still feeling is the fatigue. Also, I forgot to mention it on the medication portion but I had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen about 15 minutes before receiving that second dose.

                                                I felt palpitations around 10-12 minutes after the 1st Pfizer dose was given, and asked the Doctor to take my vital signs. I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

Starting last night, after sweating an obscene amount, I started feeling dizziness. Not a normal dizziness, but a severe one with brain zaps. The type of brain zaps someone has when coming on or off affexor/venlafaxine (which I?m currently on). The dizziness only happens when I stand and the brain zaps happen more frequently than when the dose changes or is forgotten with the snri. Before someone asks... yes... I?m taking my affexor properly and haven?t changed how I?m taking it since my covid shot.

                                                The vaccination was administered on Saturday evening, December 19th, 2020. The next morning around 10 am I began to feel nauseous and light-headed. That feeling waxed and waned all day and improved in the evening. The next morning on Monday, December 21st I was 10/10 nauseous and near vomiting. I went to work but had to leave because of nausea. Ultimately I vomited upon returning home and was nauseous with abdominal pain and achy all day. The next morning on Tuesday, December 22 nausea continued but with a rating of around 6/10. Then came the intense headache, body aches, and fatigue. This continued into the next day  (Wednesday, December 23) prompting me to get COVID tested and take off of work on Thursday, December 24th. Nausea improved (5/10)  on December 24th but fatigue, abdominal pain,  and body aches did not. December 25-27 were slow improvements with nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue but were limiting activities of daily living. By Monday, December 28th most symptoms had cleared.

This 30-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot EK5730), via an unspecified routed of administration, on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 30-years-old. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS). The patient just wanted to know how long a low grade fever is in the patients, it&#39;s been like three days now she still has low grade fever, mouth sore, sore throat and she is still so weak. The patient was treated with Tylenol. Outcome was not recovered.   The reporting nurse considered the events related to the vaccine because the events started after that.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

A 30-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0140, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 13:00 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant drug. The patient experienced recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid on 04Jan2021 00:30, mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage on 31Dec2020, loss of smell on 02Jan2021, exhaustion/feeling tired on 03Jan2021, felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe, he still has his sense of taste, but it is dulled on an unspecified date. He was a pharmacist. He received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on Thursday 31Dec2020 1pm. Shortly thereafter, he got the typical side effects of the vaccine that are posted. Then 2.5 days letter he no longer had a sense of smell. Everything he read said that he probably came in contact with COVID prior to administration. His questions was since he test positive for COVID, should he still get the second shot. He got it at a clinic. He did experience mild congestion which started by 6 o&#39;clock. He started to notice slight congestion that kind of went away. Then, on Friday, about 24 hours later, he really noticed he had congestion. He took pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). Then his sense of smell diminished with the congestion and felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe. On Saturday, he decided to not take medication. That was when he noticed he could not smell anything. He had full blown congestion. It probably took two days when he started to lose his sense of smell. He received the shot on Thursday. On Saturday, he lost his sense of smell. He still has his sense of taste, but it was dulled. Sunday, he was just exhausted and feeling tired. These were all listed as typical side effects except for the loss of smell. Saturday was the worst. The congestion went into full nasal drainage. On Sunday he had no sinus issues. He still hasn&#39;t gained his sense of smell back. The exhaustion set in Sunday 03Jan2020. He doesn&#39;t feel like any of the side effects are serious. The exhaustion has started to let up some so it is improving. He was pretty much back to normal. He just couldn&#39;t figure out why he had a loss of smell. He had a COVID rapid test on 04Jan2021 at 8:30 am (as reported). He received an alert and hour later that it was positive. He was wondering whether the loss of smell could be from the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 rapid POC test: positive on 04Jan2021. The outcome of events for mild congestion/the congestion went into full nasal drainage was resolved on 03Jan2021, for loss of smell was not resolved, for exhaustion/feeling tired was resolving, for other events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported event &#34;recently got the vaccine and also came down with covid&#34; is considered possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 based on temporal association and known drug safety profile.

Many of joints became stiff, some of which made a cracking sound when I flexed them.  Several muscles in my arms, legs and back felt sore and weak.  After a restless night of sleep, the cold sensitivity is all but gone.  Some of my joints and muscles are still a little stiff and sore, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be better by the next morning.

By 3rd barely ate only had soup and a mild case of diarrhea ,  day face neck throat pain still and swelling , warm wash clothe hot fluids help with pain, 4 day cold things help reduces swelling in face and throat, neck still swollen and a lot more pain in face jaw , neck, still hard and painful to swallow. Current day a lot of pain in jaw neck throat face still only happening on left side of body more pain then before but less swelling neck still swollen a little bit. I tried cough drops soup heat ice and still having pain don?t want to pay for an ER visit found old painkillers haven?t taken yet. How long do symptoms like these last for ? I take medication for ADD and that masks pain to make it bearable. What do you recommend to do if I don?t want to go to the ER ?

Mouth also developed sores on tongue and inside of lips. In addition feelings of achiness and fatigue. Visited dermatologist on 2/16/21 and was prescribed prednisone, prescription cortisol and hydroxyzin. Some improvement seem in 24 hours since then. Dermatologist was unable to determine source of rash and reaction, thought could be related to vaccine.  Follow up phone call scheduled for 2/19/21

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

                                                Patient woke up having seizures around 1:20am.  He is a known epileptic.  He tried to relax, and return to sleep which is normally fine for him, but the seizures continued to increase.  At 1:30am he took additional medication to help try to arrest his seizures as they were increasing in number and length.  By 6am, we headed to the hospital ER.  There his seizures progressed despite further medication until he had to be restrained, sedated, and intubated in order to stop them (which has never happened before).  Patient was further tested and eventually moved to the ICU for an overnight stay.  He was also suspected to have an infection and was spiking a fever.  On the second day in the hospital, the ventilator was removed.  Tests came back in a positive manner, and patient ended up being moved to a regular hospital room, but had to remain into a third day.  On the third day, he was finally well enough to be discharged.  All tests came back with no real answer as to why this incident spiked this event for him.

                                                As a person who has never had any kind of allergies--including seasonal allergies--as of the week I received the vaccine, I appear to have developed a new allergy to dust mites. When resting my head against a pillow (especially near the open end of the pillow case), I develop sneezing, complete sinus congestion (to the point I am not able to breathe from either nostril), runny eyes, and similar histamine responses. The symptoms have responded well to diphenhydramine and loratadine, as well as use of allergen-resistant pillowcases, but they have reduced my sleep quality in the weeks since they developed, and I feel this new allergy has negatively impacted my quality of life.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced suicidal ideation, extreme fatigue, depressed mood, brain fog, irritability, tinnitus, body temperature fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fluctuations with no fever on 28Mar2021. No treatment was received for the events. The reporter considered the events as non-serious. The event outcome was recovering. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering close temporal association, a possible contributory role of bnt162b2 to the reported events cannot be completely excluded. However the clinical course, relevant medical history and concomitant medications are pending for a medically meaningful assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 22Mar2021 at 12:30 at the age of 30 years-old, (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included dyspepsia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Severe Heartburn , blood pressure measurement from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Blood pressure , migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for blood pressure for 3 years and ongoing; pantoprazole (PANTOPRAZOLE) taken for stomach medication and heartburn for about a year. Patient states he got the first round 3 weeks ago and he is supposed to get the second dose next Monday but was advised by his doctor not to do that.      Patient states he got the shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and Tuesday 23Mar2021 he was tired and sluggish. On Wednesday 24Mar2021, mid afternoon, he had purple splotches all over his body, in arms and legs, like discoloration, his head felt like it had been dipped in cement and he couldn&#39;t think. States he felt cloudy, dizzy and woozy, nauseous, had a headache and feeling awful. States this occurred like 48 hours after the shot. He contacted a life long friend who is a doctor and works in a covid ward and he told him he was having a reaction and to take some Benadryl and Advil or Tylenol, and the friend told the patient to lay down and rest. He still didn&#39;t feel great but splotches went away and head felt a little bit clearer and he didn&#39;t feel like he was in slow motion or dizzy anymore by Wednesday evening, so he went to bed. On Thursday, the patient went into work but didn&#39;t feel great, not feeling 100%, and about noon on Thursday 25Mar2021, the symptoms started coming back, the purple splotches, his head felt just as bad, he had a headache, slow motion and not himself. The patient called his doctor and his friend and they said he needed to go in and get looked at. The patient tried to go into an urgent care and he states they said nope head to the ER. Patient states he was admitted into the ER and the ER staff said he was having more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave him steroids and an IV but he is not sure what it is and he was given, he thinks, Prednisone over the next couple days to help with side effects, he believes it was Prednisone, he knows it was a steroid. States he is not a fan of it and he doesn&#39;t like it at all. Patient states that he thought it was a pretty standard reaction and was not worried about it. Patient states he still gets headaches and maybe it&#39;s something else that is unrelated. States he stopped feeling tired and sluggish maybe the 29Mar2021, a week afterwards. Patient states that he has recovered with lasting effects as he&#39;s been getting migraines since then, states maybe it&#39;s unrelated but didn&#39;t happen a whole lot before. He has severe headaches and nothing he takes seems to help, has to turn lights off and works from home and patient reports that he had one yesterday. Patient states the purple splotches went away after he went to the ER and got on the medicine, the steroids.  P atient states the nausea was pretty constant when a headache comes on, he doesn&#39;t have a headache every day but when he gets a headache he is definitely nauseous.  The outcome of the events was for fatigue and sluggish, recovered with sequela, Purple splotches, dizzy and woozy slow motion, recovered, nausea and headache not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

I think i suffered so much pain in the 4 hours that it lasted with me until even now as i write this.  Hard to describe, but my entire body has had this tiny ache that has not gone away.  Not a big deal to me, but just wanted it documented.  I am selecting recovered even with that tiny ache still apparent because physical pain usually takes time to heal.

                                                I felt fine the rest of yesterday but started to feel really tired and worn down late last night. I took my sleeping pill like normal and went to bed. I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

Around 12:30 AM on 1/8/21 I woke up feeling very cold.  I got up, used the restroom and grabbed some acetaminophen (1000mg). I took the medication and started feeling very dizzy and light headed. After that all I remember is sitting on the kitchen floor feeling like my body was buzzing/tingling. My ears were also ringing really badly. I attempted to get up but was unable to get orientated for what I believe was about 15-30 minutes.  I called my BF at 1:10 AM after I was able to get up and moving.  I elected not to go to the ER because I didn?t want to directly expose myself to COVID. I stayed up for about another hour, drank some water and ate some crackers. I took 25mg of diphenhydramine and went back to sleep.  The rest of the day up to writing this I have been very fatigued and achy. Mild dizziness and confused feeling. I didn?t hit my head but I have about a four inch scrape down my back and a small cut on my foot from the broken glass.

A 31-year-old male patient started to receive received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number EL0140), intramuscular into the left arm on 18Dec2020, at 10:30 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.  There was no medical history and no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced infection of SARS-COV-2 on 25Dec2020. Details were as follows: The patient received the first dose of the two dose series. On 20Dec2020, he was exposed to COVID-19. Official positive diagnosis of COVID-19  was made on 25Dec2020.

The patient was scheduled to receive second dose of the vaccine; he will be out of quarantine around five to six days before that dose. The outcome of infection of SARS-COV-2 was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The efficacy of a drug varies from one patient to another and can be affected by different factors; however, a contributory role of the suspect drug BNT162B2 to the reported events drug ineffective and COVID-19 cannot be ruled out.

                                                I had soreness around my arm of injection site for about 3  days.    I also wanted to let you all know that I had a sore throat that started the day after my first dose.  Sore throat started off as mild but later got worse by the 2nd day.  I also experienced a mild grade fever, headaches, and chills which went away in a couple of days.  HOWEVER, today (1-14-2021) I decided to rule out the possibility of me having COVID.  So I got tested for covid and I was tested positive via the RT-PCR at a local urgent care facility.    So with that being said I am not quite sure if the sore throat, mild grade fever, headaches, and chills were part because of the vaccine dose (first dose)  or it could have been from  experiencing covid symptoms.    Treatment I used were drinking LOTS of water, Tylenolol and Advil, Cephacol lozenges,  and sleep.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. The patient experienced swelling in left arm/thumb and numbness from tip of thumb to joint on opposite limb of administration.  Since Wednesday, 23Dec2020, he has been experiencing some numbness in the arm opposite of where the vaccine was administered. He clarifies the vaccine was administered in the deltoid of his right arm, and the numbness he is experiencing is in his left hand. His thumb has been partially numb since last Wednesday. He got a little bit of tingling in his left arm since last Wednesday (23Dec2020).The patient explains on Tuesday, 22Dec2020, when he was administered the vaccine he only had typical side effects that went away within 24 hours. He experienced headache and muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was administered. Both of these symptoms went away and he has recovered completely. After 24-36 hours, he noticed numbness on hand opposite of the arm where the vaccine was administered. His thumb has been partially numb which has lasted about 6 days. He clarifies the numbness is on the palm side- which he was told was not related to the nerve. His thumb looks swollen and inflamed compared to the other. He also has noticed muscle weakness in the opposite arm. The patient states he can&#39;t recall if the numbness occurred within 24 hours but he knows by 24 hours, he did have the numbness. His thumb is partially numb on the side of the palm and up to the middle of his thumb where the joint is.Patient states yesterday the numbness was noticeably worse when he was sleeping. However, today the numbness seems to be back where it was before. He forgets about the numbness since he is not actively doing anything with that particular hand, but he doesn&#39;t forget about it completely. The numbness hasn&#39;t improved any, it&#39;s been consistently there and never went away. While reading off of his card, the patient cannot determine if the Lot number is an F or an E because the number is underlined. He thinks it might be an E. Patient was able to confirm the Lot number begins with an E after looking at the information sheet he was provided. He also sees the product number, CVX 208. Patient states he has no allergic reactions and nothing that he knows of that is an underlying condition. Patient states he hasn&#39;t had any testing done in regards to these events. He wanted to talk to the manufacturer and report it to the (Contact center name) first before he schedules something at Urgent Care. He wanted to check and see if what he is experiencing is a lesser known symptom. He couldn&#39;t find this information anywhere. The outcome of events, headache and muscle soreness was recovered on 23Dec2020. The outcome of Numbness in hand was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

I was forwarned that the first dose primes the immune system, 2nd can be worse, so I was taking 600 mg Motrin q6 hours. Despite that, my arm progressively hurt worse and worse until now I can?t lift it above my waist. Full body aches and pains. Horrible chills and so cold. 102.1 F is highest temp so far, but that?s on top of scheduled Motrin.   Still glad that I got it, but man does it suck right now.

                                                Following the first COVID vaccine dose on Dec/18/2020, I had headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day.  The headaches were usually light, unilateral, and alternating from one side to the other. I was usually functional except on the fourth and seventh days where the headaches were moderate to severe, and I took naps to help with the headaches for those two days. I have never had an issue with headaches before, and these symptoms were a new experience for me. I did not take any medications as treatment for the headaches. Following the second COVID vaccine dose on January/7/2021, I felt fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On January/10/2021, when I woke up that morning I again felt light, unilateral, and alternating headaches. In addition, I noticed that I was unable to move the left side of my face. I felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When I looked in the mirror, I could quite noticeably see asymmetry in my face. I immediately went to the emergency department at the hospital where my primary care doctor is located. I was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation. After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, I was provided with the diagnosis of Bells Palsy. I have never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and I have never previously had a hospital stay before. The doctors prescribed medications which I am currently taking. As of today January/12/2021, the symptoms have had some improvement, but the symptoms still continue.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

A 32-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3246) on 07Jan2021 at 09:00 a.m. intramuscular on left deltoid, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included omeprazole. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 at 09:00 on left arm (lot number: EK5730) and experienced headaches that started on the third day and ended on the tenth day. Following the second dose on 07Jan2021, patient experienced fatigue and generalized muscle aches within six to twelve hours, and these symptoms lasted for two days. On 10Jan2021, he noticed that was unable to move the left side of his face. He felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis. When looked in the mirror, he could quite noticeably see asymmetry in his face. Patient immediately visited emergency department at the hospital where his primary care doctor was located. Patient was kept in the hospital into the next day for observation (as reported). After evaluation by a neurology team and an MRI, patient was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He had never previously been diagnosed with Bells Palsy, and never previously had a hospital stay before. It was also informed that patient underwent Nasal Swab for SARS-CoV-2 test on an unspecified date in Dec2020 and on 10Jan2021, both resulted negative. At the time of the reporting, the symptoms continued.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of diagnosed Bells Palsy presented as unable to move the left side of his face/felt moderate tingling sensations associated with the distribution of the paralysis/asymmetry in his face cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient received his vaccine and was waiting in the post-vaccination waiting space. Within 5-10 minutes he slumped in his chair and became unresponsive. Became responsive to voice but was slurring his words. Patient was diaphoretic. HR in 90s, O2 98%. His eyes rolled back in his head  suspecting vasovagal episode, we moved patient to the floor  and raised his legs. He became more responsive. Was fully oriented although did not seem incredibly alert. Cycled multiple BPs with 100s-110s/60s-70s. HR 70s-80s  supine, O2 sat 96-98%.  EMS was called for transport to ED given patient&#39;s lack of prompt recovery. We  attempted to sit patient up and he again became lightheaded and had to lie back down. While in supine position, remained with normal and stable VS. At no time did he manifest any rash, respiratory symptoms, throat or chest tightness,  abdominal discomfort, or other overt signs of anaphylaxis.   Patient was transported to the ED where ROS was reported as:   - CONST: &#43;fatigue, denies fevers or chills  - EYES: Denies vision changes  - ENT: Denies rhinorrhea, sore throat  - CV: Denies new chest pain  - RESP: Denies SOB or cough  - GI: Denies abd pain, n/v, diarrhea  - GU: Denies dysuria  - MSK: Denies new joint swelling or pain  - SKIN: Denies new lesions or rash  - NEURO: Denies new HA, numbness, or weakness  - PSYCH: Denies suicidal ideation Vitals: BP 116/67, O2 99% on RA, Temp: 97.7F, Pulse 79.  ED provider felt this was most likely vasovagal episode given occurrence following vaccine administration and associated sxs. EKG without evidence of dysrrhythmia. No PE risk factors, SOB or CP. Pt with HA that was not thunderclap nor severe in nature and was consistent with prior migranes, thus do ot suspect SAH. No hx to suggest anemia and no anemia on blood work today. No report of  seizure. Pt is alert without report of post-ictal period.

I am a pharmacist with a healthcare system and they have been offering the Pfizer/Biontech COVID-19 vaccine for essential associates. I received by first dose of vaccine on 12/31/20. On 1/1/20 I woke up with very noticeable muscle aches and fairly profound lethargy, which last 18-20 hours. I was not able to do much on 1/1/21 because of the way I was feeling. I&#39;m not sure if this reaction is normal for patients who receive their COVID-19 vaccine close to their illness/infection with COVID-19, which is why I&#39;m reporting this to the FDA.

                                                I had the same symptoms on the dose two, as I did in dose 1, same timeline. My arm got heavier and hurt quite a bit. I was feeling feverish by the end of the day, a slight head ache,  clammy, mental fog, exhausted. The following day I had waves of nausea, and each of the previously reported symptoms were stronger. The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                While driving home in traffic from getting the vaccine, I felt a tingling over my whole body and then everything started to spin (vertigo). This lasted for about 10 seconds of severe vertigo and then stopped. I thought that was weird and kept driving (was in stop and go traffic) then about 1 minute later it started again and thankfully I was stopped at the time in traffic. I leaned my  seat back slightly and called my wife to tell her where I am. I couldn&#39;t pull over because there was a cement barrier on one side and 4 lanes of traffic on the other. I kept on the phone with her for the remained of my drive and it occurred one more time when I was driving home. Once home, a couple more times I felt it coming on but it didn&#39;t ever happen again. I took my blood pressure and it was normal, boarderline high when I got home (140/84). The next morning I had a fever and severe muscle aches and body aches which lasted most of the day and then today I&#39;ve felt totally fine (today being 1/23).

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I have some mild tinnitus which I&#39;ve had for 15 years since high school and rarely bothers me. Go months without noticing it.   A few hours after my first dose of Pfizer (left arm), I got a headache and some queasiness. The expected side effects. My ears started ringing louder and more pronounced, which I assumed was a side-effect of the headache and/or immune response to the vaccine. It&#39;s past two weeks now since dose 1 and my ears are still ringing much more loudly and noticeably than in the last 15 or so years. All other side effects have long ago subsided. It seems to be worse in left ear, the same side I got shot on. I imagine that&#39;s irrelevant, but mentioning it anyway here.   Distracting and distressing.  Am scheduled for a second dose on April 21 and now hesitant about getting it.

A 33-year-old patient (husband) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 05Apr2021 15:40 (Lot Number: ER8734) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atopic dermatitis. Concomitant medication included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), an injection that patient takes every other week to control his atopic dermatitis, he has been using this for 3 years at least. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER6207) in left shoulder on 15Mar2021 15:40, at the age of 32 years old, for COVID-19 immunization, and experienced arm sore and body aches. The patient experienced vomiting blood in Apr2021, blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up / spitting up blood in Apr2021, he feels like his throat is so raw on 05Apr2021, sore arm on 05Apr2021, feeling achy/ her husband is still sore/achy today on 05Apr2021, nauseous on 05Apr2021, vomiting/ throwing up on 05Apr2021, diarrhea on 05Apr2021, chilly in Apr2021, redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids; his pores looked red in Apr2021, fatigue on 05Apr2021. No treatment received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events pain in arm, ache, nauseous, erythema, fatigue was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Clinical course as reported: Her husband got their second dose of the vaccine on 05Apr2021. Her husband was having a more severe reaction than the first time. The first time he got the vaccine his arm was sore. Last night (05Apr2021), the caller&#39;s husband was vomiting just over and over and had diarrhea, both at the same time. Wife added the thing she was worried about was that her husband was vomiting blood as well, and that her husband said it was from the phlegm, like he felt like his throat was so raw. Her husband did not really want to eat anything which she expected was normal. She was trying to give him fluids, and having him drink a little bit. Her husband had not vomited since around 4 am. And right now, he was sleeping. She did not know if she should give him medicine or take him to be seen or if this was a normal reaction to the vaccination. She did read side effects from the paper and she saw that some vomiting was expected but the blood was what caught her off guard. Around 10 o&#39;clock last night (05Apr2021), her husband felt nauseous and went to bed. She actually fell asleep on the couch and heard her husband vomiting across the house, that was how bad the vomiting was. The vomiting started at midnight last night (05Apr2021). Her husband has been vomiting every couple of hours (2 hours), around the clock. Diarrhea had been at the same time. From her understanding, her husband had vomited at least 3 or 4 times, and had diarrhea 3 or 4 times. She kind of lost track after the 3rd time, but she had not heard him since around 4 am Her husband was still sore/achy today (06Apr2020) and was is still nauseous. She believed he was also feeling chilly. He was wrapped up in his blanket. Her husband did not have a fever, she has been checking his temperature. Wife stated no treatment yet, as she did not know what was safe. Her husband wanted to wait until he stopped vomiting because anything he put in his stomach came right back up. After the first time her husband was done throwing up, and was only dry heaving, he started to like kind of spit. When he would gargle or spit, there was blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up. The first time the wife went to check on him, she saw him spitting up blood. It was not like his vomit was red with blood in it, it was just the after effects, so she thought she should call and report this. Each time he has vomited, there was still that spit up of blood afterwards. The patient himself clarified the vomiting was last around 4 am (06Apr2020), give or take, and the last stool/bout of diarrhea was around 7 am (06Apr2020). He was still feeling nauseous and fatigued. He added that after the first time he vomited and the couple times he checked later on, he looked in the mirror and saw that there was this redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids. He adds it was red, it wasn&#39;t like splotchy, but it was like his pores looked red, like pinpoints. The patient clarified that the fatigue and achiness probably started around the first time he vomited, and that was still hanging around. The wife stated this was better than him getting Covid. Wife added what she was trying to see was if she should take her husband to the hospital or not. She did not want to wait too long, but if this was something that was a side effect that was expected, then her husband could just sleep it off.

                                                I received my shot at 3:30 PM on 01/09/21.  I felt very tired on 01/12/21 before that went away that evening.  I began feeling dizzy and nauseus around 8:00 PM Monday, 01/11/21, and again periodically on 01/12/21.  The dizzy and nausea feeling continued consistently throughout 01/12/21 and 01/13/21.  I went to my primary care provider on 01/12/21 who gave me medication to help with nausea and dizziness.  She chalked it up to anxiety.  I became more worried on the evening of 01/13/21 and went to the ER.  The ER doctor stated it could be a reaction to the vaccine, inflammation in the ear/calcium buildup in the ear, or just my anxiety.  I do want to note I was nervous about getting this shot and have a history of having trouble distinguishing between true issues I am having and issues caused by my anxiety.  As of today, 01/15/21, I took Methazine which seems to have helped the dizziness, but not completely.  I am not currently nauseus.

Went to bed, woke up the next morning (2/6) with itching and rash along back, from hips to hairline at neck, on back of shoulders, biceps, neck, upper chest. area Noticed an outline of bumps/lesions in the shape of the band-aid applied after injection.  Having had shingles once before 8 years ago, this feels a lot like that. Soreness persists at injection site but comparable to flu vaccine.

Second shot same as above but starting 24 hours after vaccine I developed left axillary pain. Able to palpate a lymph node ~1cm. Very painful on palpation. Has not limited activity but still painful. Was difficult to fall asleep  2 nights after vaccine. Now day 2 after vaccine still hurts, maybe incrementally better but taking ibuprofen. Cannot palpate significant lymphadenopathy otherwise.  No fever. I am a physician.

                                                Chills and muscle fatigue starting around 10:30am 1/12. Grew more intense throughout the day and into the night.  Had a fever starting around 3pm 1/12. Stayed around 102 until it went down after 3am (I took Tylenol 8pm and 12am) Headache starting evening of 1/12. At one point started to feel a slight tightening/tickle in my chest when taking deep breaths.  Overall felt sick for about 17 hours and wasn&#39;t able to work or do much beyond laying around. After getting the second dose, the only side effect at first was soreness at injection site. It was surprising that I didn&#39;t start to experience other side effects until the next day. As I type this up the next morning, I&#39;m feeling about back to normal, though sore from the chills. Slept for almost 11 hours. Temperature back to normal, no headache this morning.

                                                2nd dose administered Thursday Jan 14th @ 2pm. Symptoms started  Friday Jan 15th  @ 0630 am. Became extremely lightheaded/dizzy. Became nauseous. Felt as I was going to pass out. Made it to bathroom as I thought I was going to vomit. Essentially collapsed on floor and had severe rigors/uncontrollable shaking throughout entire body for 30 minutes. Felt as I was being electrocuted, it was extremely intense and could feel it through every part of my body. Teeth were clenched entire time and could barely open mouth. Attempted to get up multiple times but could not make it past getting on my knees. Laid on floor  until shaking eventually subsided. Had severe headache after (i assume it was from clenching teeth for 30 min). Extreme fatigue.  Was sent to ER per policy for covid test - results negative. Sent home from work per policy. Slept remainder of day. Woke up @ 5 pm feeling substantially better.

                                                Severe cervical spine pain and stiffness with paresthesias in bilateral arms and weakness in right tricep and scapula. Took OTC acetaminophen and NDAIDs. Visited employees health who sent me to urgent care for neurological exam. Urgent care physician noted right arm weaker than left and recorded report of bilateral upper extremity paresthesia. Recommended follow up exam and cervical MRI if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within 7 days. Neck pain has improved but still present. Paresthesias still present. Right arm (dominant arm) still weaker than left. Will follow up with primary care physician this week if symptoms continue.  Additional side effects: headache, dizziness, nausea, shivers, fatigue, joint pain (all resolved within 72 hours).

                                                24 hr after vaccine, I had fatigue and generalized body aches and left arm pain at site of injection. I took tylenol.  Those stopped by the second day morning (day after vaccine). However, in the second morning ( day after vaccine) I started having pain on left side of neck and on Trapezius muscle on left shoulder blade - and had that pain for three more days. Range of motion for neck restricted for three days. All symptoms improved after four days. I took Lidocaine patch and Tylenol for neck and shoulder blade pain.

                                                For Dose 1, no adverse events other than mild light-headedness and mild joint ache, which began approximately 2 hours after injection and resolved within 24 hours; soreness at the injection site began approximately 6 to 12 hours after injection and persisted for 48 to 72 hours. For Dose 2 (1:15pm), soreness at the injection site began approximately 2 hours after injection (3pm) and was more pronounced than Dose 1. I felt onset of mild fatigue beginning approximately 3 hours post-injection (4pm). Approximately 10 hours post-injection (11pm), onset of fever, chills, muscle ache, and joint ache, was dramatic. I was unable to record my temperature, but felt the fever diminish in intensity approximately 13 hours post-injection (2am). It persisted from this time as muscle aches, joint aches, and sweating intensified throughout the night, and the onset of heart arrhythmia and mild tightness in the chest, as well as a light cough and trouble breathing became a concern. I was unable to sleep and took Tylenol approximately 15 hours post-injection (4am). I took more Tylenol in the morning at approximately 9am, by which time the fever still felt present but low-grade, the muscle and joint aches were still fairly intense, and I noticed that my axillary lymph nodes had swollen to the size of golf balls, with the larger on the same side as the injection. I then took ibuprofen around 1pm. Very mild fever, moderate sweating, cough, muscle aches, joint aches, and heart arrhythmia persisted throughout the day and into the night. All symptoms had not resolved until Friday, Day 3 post-injection.

                                                Severe abdominal pain.  The shot was given at approx 11 am.  Abdominal pain started around 6 pm, gradually got worse.  At 1 am I was awoken in pain and I took hydrocodone leftover from a previous surgery in hopes of making it to the morning for urgent care.  (ER Bills)  At 4 am I was re-awoken in even worse pain, decided I was about to die, and went to the ER.  Cold sweat on way to ER.  Throat dry.  Made it to ER, received Morphine, the first dose calmed the pain down, did not make it go away.  A lot of tests and several hours later, a second dose was given when the pain returned to its terrible state.  Approx 15 min into the second dose pain was finally subsiding (roughly 1 or 2 pm).  Went home and took Tylonal as requested by Docs and filled an Oxy prescription in anticipation of the return of the pain.  This has not happened.  Slept great last night.  Dry Mouth Persists.  Also slight arm tenderness.

The main thing I wanted to report is that I feel my heart and blood flow had been compromised from the vaccine.  The reason I say this is that I have been getting pains in my chest and the blood flow in my body just feels not right.  Lastly, I do feel it affected my cognition but I hope this will resolve soon as the fatigue dissipates.   I also easily get skin reactions (skin reactivity increased such as redness and I got one red bump that looks like a hive but went away the next day).  Not sure, but I feel this vaccine may be a cause for a potential blood clot. I do wonder if it has any effect on the characteristics of the blood.  This is so far my experience and I hope as time goes on things become better.

A 35-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1685, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 19Dec2020 10:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Hemophilia A.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. The patient stated that he got his first COVID vaccine, but stated that he has hemophilia A and was worried about getting the second dose. The patient reported that two weeks later after getting the vaccine, on 02Jan2021, he had fever, chills, and body aches. He went to the dentist on 02Jan2021 who told him that he had a herpes in his mouth. The patient stated that it was just a blister. All of these effects have gone away completely now and he has recovered completely. The patient stated that he was able to get the fever under control by 06Jan2021. He was not scheduled to get the second dose yet but stated because he worked at the hospital he can go anytime and get it; he just had not gotten it yet because he wanted to ask about the hemophilia A. Clinical outcome of fever was recovered on 06Jan2021, for chills and body aches was recovered on 04Jan2021, for herpes in mouth was recovered on 15Jan2021, while for the blister was unknown.

Possibly some worsening exercise tolerance ~3-4 weeks after initial onset date. I&#39;m not sure if it was deconditioning vs lingering covid effects.   No side effects from first covid vaccine minus a sore arm. After second dose some mild fatigue ~2 days. Then 12 days after second dose significant more fatigue and in the next few days chills at night and tachycardia with pulse in 120s at rest. No fever, pain, sob, swelling or other symptoms. Presented to immediate care on 2/27 predominantly for the tachycardia. Was referred to the ED.  Discharged on 3/1 on metoprolol with possible diagnosis of viral myocarditis.

                                                I began experiencing soreness at injection site and pain in right arm pit approximately 6 hours after vaccination, approximately 4-5PM. Approximately 10 hours after vaccination i felt very fatigued and tired and went to bed early. Approximately 12 hours after vaccination I woke from sleep with fevers (101.8), chills, and headache. I took tylenol, fever subsided,  and was able to return to sleep at approximately  4:00AM. I woke at 6:30AM with headache, dizziness, and fever (99-100).  I took more tylenol and fever and headache subsided. For remainder of day temperature would start in increase, but stayed below 99, and headache would return between doses of tylenol. I slept through the night of 1/9/2021 and woke 1/10/2021 without fever or headache, although I would experience dizziness with exertion above level of walking.  Today, 1/11/2021, I am not experiencing any symptoms.

I am a physician who likely had contracted COVID in 04/2020 and has been suffering long COVID sx since. No significant reaction to dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine other than sore arm. 2nd dose within 12 hours had severe rigors, severe chills, then fever to 39.6 the first night (took 1 dose of tylenol and 1 of advil after), temp of 38-39 the next 12 hours, and then the 2nd night had a fever high of 41.4 degrees (took another tylenol). Had sweats the entire night after and defervesced after. Day 3-5 mostly involve myalgia, nausea, anorexia, malaise, chills, HA, and mild SOB. Took about 1 week to &#34;recover&#34; to my long COVID baseline after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Still having a bit worse SOB now compared to prior to 2nd dose but unsure if it has to do with the vaccine at this point. Had tested for positive anti-spike protein ab (likely from the 1st dose) the morning of my 2nd dose of vaccine.

Began to feel flu like symptoms approx 1800 on the evening of 1/19/21. Symptoms worsened through the night rapidly, beginning with uncontrollable chills/shivering, body aches, restless, slight vertigo, weakness/fatigue. At approx 0100 the morning of 1/20/21, blacked out while in the bathroom of which awoken and found myself disoriented, weak, and on the ground (no injuries noted as i must have eased myself down).  I was able to hydrate afterwards and tolerate eating some dry cereal to help with the weakness. Symptoms began to dissipate while an intense headache continued throughout the night and even through the daytime. The time is now 1020 on the day of 1/20/21 and i still have quite the headache but all other symptoms seem to be relieved at this time.

That mostly disapated after about fours hours sleep that evening.  The headache lasted most the following week, but was tolerable and minor.  I noticed near end of the week following injection that my injection site began to swell a little and turn red, very similar to a white head.  This has continued to be present now still two weeks following.

                                                roughly  10 hours after receiving the vaccine I woke up not feeling well, I can only describe it as shock/septic shock signs and symptoms symptoms! my fever must have been through the roof because I was so cold I couldn?t even move to get and take some Tylenol! probably about an hour or two after waking up I was able to crawl and take some Tylenol and instantly went back to bed or passed out I woke up a hour later with nausea and vomiting probably once my fever started to come down when making my way to the bathroom I was having trouble standing up from the fever or blood pressure I can?t be certain because I wasn?t able to take my blood pressure. after my vomiting had subsided I took a 1000 mg of Tylenol and didn?t wake up until the next day where signs and symptoms are evident but not severe as the previous night

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                EE reports he received pfizer vaccine on 1/21/21.  He noted extreme fatigue on 1/22/21 and today 1/23/21 noted an inability to form words and talk while on the phone, dizzy, tongue is half numb, and notes sweating.   EE advised to f/u with ER for assessment.  Consult with Dr.  e-mail was sent alerting her to this reaction.  MAJ follow up on 1/26:  ED record reviewed.  EE had vaccine injected on 1/21 and experienced chills and nausea on 1/22.  On 1/23 he had 1-2 minutes of aphasia and R jaw numbness.  ED evaluation that afternoon revealed a well-appearing adult with normal vital signs and neurologic exam.  Assessment by ED physician was that this was not a stroke or transient ischemic attack but might be a vaccine-related adverse event.  The ee was referred for follow-up with his PCP, Dr. , who can be emailed if further follow up information is needed.  I suspect the ee became dehydrated from vaccine-related nausea and that this was the cause of his transient neurologic symptoms.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 06Jan2021 at 15:00, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It has already been a week since he had the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and he is still experiencing or having symptoms such as chills, body aches, low grade fever, and headache from 06Jan2021. The patient had been taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) for the symptoms, but they still reappear after the medication has worn off. Symptoms will go away with the paracetamol but come back when it wears off. The patient did not feel this is serious, just a little concerning. The patient wanted to know if this is a normal response. The patient had not recovered from the events.

                                                I received my second shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, March 20th at noon.  Saturday at midnight, I woke up in full body sweats and aches.  I took two ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep, but I would toss and turn in full body sweats and aches for the next 8 hours.  I took another 2 ibuprofen around 400am.  Sunday morning I woke up feeling OK, not great, but OK.  Sunday night ? it was very strange ? the full body chills and aches came back.  Not as bad as Saturday night, but they returned nevertheless.  I had another restless night of sleep, and I took another two rounds of ibuprofen to try and help me sleep.  Monday I woke up feeling OK again.  Monday evening, around 8:00pm, I could feel the full body chills and aches coming back again, creeping up slightly.  This time, I also felt a mild burning in my upper chest and throat.  I went to bed around 8:00pm, then woke up at 9:00pm, this time in a lot of pain.  It felt like burning and a stabbing sensation in my throat and upper chest.  I took some ibuprofen, and tried to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned in agony for the next few hours, apparently falling asleep at some point around 1:00am.  At 2:00am I woke up in severe pain again.  It was very bad, like an 8 out of a 10.  It felt like a burning and stabbing sensation in my lower throat and upper chest.  I had my wife call 911, and I was brought to hospital in an ambulance.  I would stay in the hospital for the next 3 days, getting discharged Thursday at around 5:00pm.  I had peak troponin levels of 5, so I basically had a moderate heart attack.  I had a cardiac catherization procedure done, as well as a cardiac MRI.  The cardiac catherization procedure showed I had no blockages at all in my arteries.  The cardiologists diagnosed me with myocarditis.  The cardiologists told me they believe the vaccine triggered a heavy response from my auto immune system.  The response from my auto immune system in turn caused my heart to become inflamed, giving me myocarditis.  It was a horrible experience, and my doctors are convinced that it was brought on by the second coronavirus vaccine shot that I received.

Received vax and went home, slept 7 hours, got up and had an extremely strenuous workout including deadlifts (pyramid to heavy weight, 275lb x 5 reps in HIIT sets with kettlebell swings, and boxing in garage gym. Was 45 dF at the time. Patient was finishing workout with last 2 minutes boxing on a 100lb heavy bag and suddenly felt violent &#34;pop&#34; in right medial gastrocnemius muscle. Pt stopped workout and could barely put weight on right leg and reported back to work for shift within 45 minutes of event. Pt iced 4x per day for next 2 days (current), walking better by 2nd day but still very painful and unable to put much weight on forefoot. This has never occurred to patient. Possibly related to vaccine? Worth reporting

                                                Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 at 15:15 hours.  A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol.

When I came back around 4pm I was feeling okay, no sore on the injection site, unlike my regularly flu vaccines that I mostly feel sore at injection site which lasts about few hours immediately after the flu shot, so it was sort of surprising to see that but later that night, my body starts feeling weak, aches and a tangling on my feet, as the night progresses up to the early morning, I was unusually fatigued and lightheaded with the regression of the muscle aches and subsequently other symptoms started disappearing, notably, I started feeling soreness on the injection site, which lingered to the next day.

Recovered consciousness within a few seconds, had to lay on the floor for about 5 minutes due to nausea, then got back in bed and went back to sleep.  Woke up 3 hours later and felt completely fine except a little fatigue - all other symptoms had resolved.

The worst occurred the day after when my body could no longer absorb insulin. I increased my basal rate by almost 400% and could not bring my sugars down. Saturday afternoon I began experiencing symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis: stomach pain, vomiting, high ketones and very high  blood sugars. I was able to eventually take in enough water to lower my ketones and sugar and narrowly avoided going to the ER, but high blood sugars and headache have persisted and I am still experiencing these symptoms.

Next day the muscle aches were all over but not as bad, but a severe headache all day. Treated with tylenol all day along with ibuprofen &#43; tylenol at night. The next day I felt fine, however noticed a baseball sized lump under my left armpit about 60 hours after the shot in my left shoulder. Internet says it&#39;s a swollen lymph node and known side effect. The next morning the swelling went down significantly and after another day it seems to be getting better.

Had first COVID-19 vaccination on 2/13.  Cannot exclude paraneoplastic syndrome; possible hilar mass noted on CXR will need further work-up to rule out sarcoid/malignancy. Concern for viral meningitis.  No known sick contacts. Another tonic-clonic seizure occurred around 08:00 on 2/24 AM with vomiting; no overt aspiration though certainly high risk given situation.&#34;

He reported to her that he has &#34;non-stop ringing in the ear&#34;, &#34;wanted to kill himself because of ringing&#34;; couldn&#39;t sleep all night&#34;, had fever. On 2/23, patient&#39;s symptoms got worse. He vomited twice, ringing in the ear continued, had headache, fever, and poor appetite. He also couldn&#39;t sleep. The mother of the patient was advised by the case management team that it&#39;s not uncommon for 2nd shot to cause slight flu-like symptoms for a short while, but she probably needs to call 911 if patient exhibits suicidal tendencies and take him to ED.  She said she already tried over the weekend, called Hatzola. 6 people came to and spoke with patient, including psych. Hatzola left, the patient was not deemed at risk, refused to go anywhere.  She was concerned that he refused to follow up with outside PMD. She was given further instructions to take the patient to the ER and call with any other questions and concerns. She was not heard from since. Attempts were made to contact the patient to follow up, but to no avail. Patient&#39;s phone appears to be off.

Very big and itchy. I took some Claritin. Those welts continued to grow and spread;  Upper inner arms, flanks, inner thighs.  Continued throughout the night  *took pictures of welts Took some Benadryl at night. Woke up; symptoms still there and extended even more to include hands. I went to work. I wasn&#39;t feeling ill but uncomfortable. Took some more antihistamines. It got worse thru the day. No SOB.  1/12 noon Different kind of rash, petechia in appearance.; shins. My knees, ankles, feet were starting to swell.  Hives had gone from the thighs and up, But below, shins to feet, were swelling.  1/13 I woke up to a lacy rash over all extremities. Bruising on shins. Knees, hands and feet still swollen.  Started Oral steroid. By noon that day, pretty much everything had cleared up. Six day course treatment, no symptoms came back. No fever. No SOB. I did miss work the 1/13 as it was at its worse.

                                                I experienced the normal moderate soreness after both injections as well as the expected mild flu like symptoms for about a day after the second injection.  The primary reason i am reporting an adverse effect is that I am still experiencing mild soreness in the shoulder muscle into which the vaccine was injected.  Occasionally, this soreness seems to be present in the other muscles of my upper arm as well.  This mild soreness has persisted and been very consistent ever since the initial moderate soreness from the first injection subsided about 2 months ago.  I have not experienced this type of lingering soreness following any previous vaccination.

On day 10, March 20, 2021, at approximately 5:00 pm, I lost all hearing in my right ear.  I was turned away as a possible ear infection, but due to the complete loss of hearing, I followed up on Tuesday, March 23, 2021.  After being seen by an ENT, I was diagnosed with Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss in my Right ear.  I have started treatment with my first injection into the eardrum and am currently on day 3 of oral steroids (predniSONE - 20mg Tablets, 3x first 7 days, 2x days 8-9, 1x day 10).  No improvement or recovery as of yet, if at all.

His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I felt myself get very flushed and slightly lightheaded.  This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

Over the following next few hours I began to have overall body aches and pains in my joints.  My skin became extremely sensitive to the touch, a very strange hard to describe sensation.  I then began to get the chills, and running a fever.  Ultimately my fever spiked at 104 degrees.   I took a cold bath to bring the fever down, and for the rest of the night seesawed back and forth with fever using cold compresses and no sheets on my bed to keep my fever down.  I also took one 200 Mg Ib-Profen.  At roughly 26 hours after the injection, I no longer have a fever, but the body aches persist.

A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), on an unspecified date (dose number= 1, lot number: EK5730) then on 06Jan2021, 11:30 (dose number= 2, lot number: EL3248), both at a single dose, via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: Arm Left) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced fatigue few hours after the second vaccine (06Jan2021) followed by fever, chills and nausea/vomiting. The latter lasted about 6 hours but was horrible. Treatment received for the adverse event were paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The outcome of the events was recovered on Jan2021.

When he got diagnosed, he was managing symptoms with Zinc, Vitamin C and over the counter, the stuff like that). Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient just got the first dose of the Covid19 vaccine yesterday and last night on 12Jan2021 at 2:00 he got a fever and experienced pretty bad headache and body ache which feels like having Covid19 again. He thought it was last month or a few months ago. So, he mentioned that it feels like having Covid19 again and wanted to know if this was normal. The patient just wanted to make sure those were typical side effects from what have seen so far. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I had severe fatigue, and muscle aches centering in my lower back. I took my temperature and it was 100 degrees. I took Aleve and laid back down. My fever subsided, but I continued to intermittently feel chills throughout the day. I took a warm bath and shower. I felt exhausted and the ache in my back continued. I laid back down from 5-11pm and continued to feel chills, though not as severe as they had been. In the evening, beginning around 7, when I would get up I felt a chill and a wave of paranoia, affecting my mental stability. These would subside when I laid back down. I retired to bed at 11 and woke up at 5am completely drenched in sweat. I changed clothes and returned to bed. When I woke up at 7:30am for work, I felt much better and have felt fairly normal, except for being dehydrated, since.

Intense fatigue and full body aches set in within 3 hours. Facial numbness and left-side facial drooping began within 8 hours. Low fever, chills, heavy heartbeat, and intermittent cramps of the abdomen and on the left side (between hip and rib cage) began within 18 hours. Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and constipation began within 48 hours. Facial numbness, heavy heartbeat, and fatigue persist, though drooping has become less pronounced and the other symptoms have largely resolved at 100 hours since the first shot.
