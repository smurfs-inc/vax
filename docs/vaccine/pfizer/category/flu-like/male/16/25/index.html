His mother gently lowered him to the ground (@ 1804). Patient&#39;s mother stated he just passed out and that this was his first injection ever in his life. Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient&#39;s legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling &#34;a star&#34; on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%. Immediately after the patient passed out the second time, his pulse was measured at 38 bpm and his lips displayed slight cyanosis. His pulse quickly rose to 52 bpm, within less than 10 seconds. One minute later his pulse was up to 68 bpm.

                                                seizure like symptoms; Dizziness; lethargy; fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist.  A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of intramuscular BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 02Mar2021 at 12:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 16-year-old. Lot number was EN6205. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. On 02Mar2021 at 12:00, the patient experienced Dizziness, seizure like symptoms, lethargy, fatigue. It was unknown if the patient was treated due to the events. The patient recovered from the events in Mar2021. It was unknown if the patient had COVID prior vaccination; it was unknown if the patient was tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Seizure cannot be excluded.

He was pale, lips were blue tinged, pulse was 60, sweating and blood pressure was 98/50. Paramedics were called but he had recovered by the time they got there. They said he had a fainting episode due to the vaccination and did not have a seizure. The patient had not eaten anything  the whole day and he felt that contributed. Followed up with patient&#39;s parent and he is feeling just fine now.

                                                High blood sugars for a week now.  My son is 16 year&#39;s old and was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in November.  He is thin and active, and an otherwise healthy teen and runner.  He is in his &#34;honeymoon phase&#34; of diabetes and I think the vaccine may be killing off beta cells.  He went from having blood sugar levels in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s at 12 units of Lantus to now 120&#39;s to 130&#39;s and up to 160&#39;s immediately after the shot.  His mealtime insulin is also not working at the same number of units and he&#39;s going in the 200&#39;s when he was around 160&#39;s before the shot. It has lasted now for a week instead of the 48 hours I was told about and read about.   As soon as we were leaving from getting his vaccine, he started experiencing extreme fatigue.  That night and for 2 days he had a headache.  He is still more tired than usual and having to take naps.

He was able to respond to verbal commands, and never had complete LOC.  We were able to provide oral hydration and cold compresses.  After 15 mins I was able to have him sit in a chair, where he stated he was feeling much better.  After a total of 45 mins, he was able to walk out of clinic independently

                                                Patient was nervous upon receipt of vaccine.  It was an unscheduled (expiring) dose.  Per parent, he had fallen asleep outside vaccine room and they had to wake him up to get vaccine.   I gave immunization and asked him to stay for 15 minutes afterwards.  His Mom ran to consult window to notify staff patient was passing out.  I was sanitizing vaccine room so I immediately ran to him and his Dad and I caught him as he was slumping over.  He was shaking really hard, weak, and clammy.  He was coherent b/c I asked him his name but did not have clear recollection of timing of vaccine.  He was very pale in color.  His Mom grabbed him a Gatorade and he seemed very thirsty as he was drinking.  He mentioned he felt dizzy and that both arms were hurting and the arm I gave vaccine in felt like he had sweat dripping off it.  (I felt his arm and it did not).  I grabbed an instant cold pack and placed on his neck to help cool him off.  His color returned over the 30 minutes.  I asked parents if they wanted me to call ambulance but they wanted to wait and see how he responded.  He looked at his iPhone data and his heart rate had spiked.  Unclear if right before vaccine or right after but I believe he mentioned it went up to 120 when Mom said his normal resting heart rate was 60.  He ate some gold fish and seemed to perk up and have a few funny conversations showing his personality.  I explained to him very important to let parents know if he experienced any other side effects after leaving.  He was able to stand up and walk out of RX with parents.

His hands were clammy. He said he felt like his body was numb. We had him remove his mask and got him some water. He never actually lost consciousness. Eventually we had him lay down and put his feet up. His father was contacted and came to pick him up. We spoke to his mom later and she said he was feeling much better.

A 16-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 12:00 (at 16-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The caller is calling about her 16 year old son. She just left the doctor with her son who received his first Covid 19 vaccine. She would like to report an adverse event. Her son has had a fever of 105.2F (07Apr2021). The doctor just did blood tests, a rapid test for Covid that was negative, they tested him for strep throat that was negative and he doesn&#39;t have an ear infection. He&#39;s been running a fever over 105F for the past 2 days (07Apr2021). The caller wanted to rule out that nothing else is going on. They have called the Medical Director of (name)  and he didn&#39;t know what was going on with her son. If this fever continues she&#39;ll be calling Pfizer back. She is waiting on the results of his blood tests like his mononucleosis test pending and other viral and bacterial tests (unknown result). Her son started feeling bad about 4-5 days (unspecified date) after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. The last 2 days he&#39;s had a very high fever. He has a headache and body aches (unspecified date). He had a Covid 19 test not long before he received the Covid 19 vaccine and it was negative. She thought her son might have the Covid 19 virus but he had the rapid Covid 19 rapid test (09Apr2021) and it was negative. The caller does not know what is going on with her son. She took her son to a clinic because he was sick and because his fevers are too high. She also called the state but they told her that fevers are normal with the Covid 19 vaccine but if it persists after today, 09Apr2021, she needs to seek medical attention. It was further reported that earlier in the week her son told her he thought he was going to pass out at work (unspecified date). He told her he thought he had a fever but she checked it with a forehead thermometer and it didn&#39;t show a fever. Then on Wednesday, 07Apr2021, her son woke up around 4:30AM and had a fever of 105.2F with an oral thermometer. He woke Thursday, 08Apr2021 and this morning, Friday 09Apr2021 with a fever. His mother can control the fever during the day with Ibuprofen but he&#39;s spiking these fevers in the middle of the night. She knows fevers spike at night but she can&#39;t come with any other reason why this is happening. The patient lab tests and procedures also included CBC: pending, mononucleosis: pending, and rapid strep test: Negative; all from 09Apr2021. The outcome of events fever of 105.2f, headache, and body aches was not recovered; while for other events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Patient was shaking and went unconscious for a few seconds. Patient regained consciousness but was able to sit and drink water until paramedics arrived. Administering pharmacist suspects it was a seizure but that was not verified. Patient left with paramedics.

He said he didn?t say anything  until his eyes were black and couldn?t see then he said he didn?t feel so good.  The color drained from his body and he went limp.  Luckily a nearby paramedic caught him and he was wheeled to a recovery room to be monitored. Patient felt better after 15 Mins but it was so scary.  We didn?t expect any reactions as hes gotten all of his immunizations and never had any reactions.  I was really traumatized by this whole event.  The staff there were very nice and helpful and helped us ease thru his recovery.  I wanted to report this incident so that way you have a log of adverse side affects from getting the vaccine.  I hope the 2nd shot will be ok.... I?m very scared at this point. TBD

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after being administered with Pfizer COVID vaccine patient became lightheaded and almost fainted. Patient did not fall out of chair, but did slouch over in chair. The patient&#39;s father alerted pharmacy staff and the nurse administering vaccines today, and I went out to check on him. Patient was sitting up in chair at this time, but was very sweaty, pale and cloudy. Nurse instructed him to place his head down by his knees and provided him with water, Gatorade, and cold compresses. Once patient was feeling a little bit better we moved him into a private room with father and let him lay down at rest. When patient felt okay to leave he was advised to lay flat when he got home and eat. Father was also advised to stay with him until he was feeling 100%. Event lasted approximately 30 minutes.  A call was placed to parents around 3pm to check on him and he was doing well. (moving around and playing video games)

A 16-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 16Apr2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 16-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mental illness and autism from unspecified dates and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2, administered in right arm on Mar2021 (Lot number was unknown), at the age of 16 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no other vaccines in four weeks. Several hours after receiving the second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 16Apr2021 20:00, the individual developed a headache and took ibuprofen (ADVIL) and water. About an hour later, he was disoriented and the parent (who was a nurse practitioner) asked him questions and he was having a hard time answering. Patient&#39;s fever was over 103 in the ambulance. He was tested for everything at the hospital and all was negative. It was determined to be an adverse reaction to the vaccine and what likely happened is his temperature spiked so quickly that he had a seizure. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment for other adverse events was unknown. There was no COVID prior vaccination and patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about lot/batch has been requested.

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  Patient is a 16 year old boy with ADHD who presented with fever and myalgias for 3 days, that progressed to sharp parasternal chest pain and some SOB. Patient received second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 4/26, and after that shot experienced fever to 102 at home and myalgias. Subsequently his symptoms of chest pain have occurred. He underwent workup revealing of elevated Troponin, and EKG with some ST segment elevation, a slightly elevated CRP at 32, and a normal ECHO. Admitted for observation and concern for infectious myocarditis vs MIS-C. Cardiac MRI was done confirming Myocarditis, Troponin I was elevated and peaked at 23, 325pg/mL. Workup unrevealing of SARS. Other testing showed Resp virus panel negative, blood pcr for EBV, CMV, Parvovirus B19, enterovirus, and adenovirus all negative, HIV antigen/antibody testing negative. Patient treated with Ketorolac with steady improvement in symptoms over several hospital days. Discharged home 5/2 with Troponin I well down and symptoms resolved. Given reports in lay press regarding other cases of COVID-19 MRNA vaccine associated myocarditis, we are reporting this as a vaccine associated adverse event.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old young man presenting with chest pain admitted for myopericarditis.   He was in his usual state of good health until 2 days ago when he experienced fever, chills and myalgias after receiving his 2nd dose of COVID pfizer vaccine. He improved until 5/2 when he developed a crushing, non-radiating, substernal chest pain which was waxing and waning in nature without specific alleviating factors. He had shortness of breath, but no palpitation, dizziness, or changes in pain on exertion vs rest. Family activated EMS who gave 325 mg of aspirin en route to the ED.   In the ED, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was mildly diaphoretic, but otherwise, unremarkable on physical exam. STAT EKG showed ST elevations in V5 and V6 and ST depressions in V1 and V2 as well as PR depressions, which persisted on repeated EKG. Given concern for myopericarditis, they ordered labs including CBC, CMP, troponin and inflammatory markers which were only remarkable for troponin of 1.94 and CRP 3.5. Chest x-ray was normal.    Cardiology was consulted and they recommended transthoracic echo which is pending. Cards also recommended starting Ibuprofen 600 mg q8 hrs and admission to cards for further management.

The following day his throat was sore and he had cough and chest tightness.  He took an albuterol  neb which relieved the cough and chest tightness.  I saw him in clinic on 5/7/21.  His COVID PCR was negative.  His lungs were clear.  My assessment is that most likely his symptoms were related to a respiratory virus or seasonal allergies triggering his underlying asthma.  I do not suspect that his symptoms were related to the vaccine.

Still has difficulty focusing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father). A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: ER2613 and expiry: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 31Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Vaccination was taken because he was going back to school. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EN6199, Expiry: Jun2021) on 10Mar2021 at 13:30 in right arm (at the age of 16-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and experienced loss of taste and smell and joint pain, all events started in Mar2021. Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation. Family Medical History included Sarcoidosis with mother. Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm at 17:30, tiredness at 20:30, shortness of breath, headache at 22:30 and muscle pain at 22:30. On 01Apr2021, the patient experienced fever at 00:30, chills at 01:30, redness at 02:30, leg pain at 08:30, fatigue (ongoing) at 02:30, joint pain at 08:30, too sick to get out of bed and passed out and hit the floor, put a big bump on his head at 05:30 (about 15 hours after second dose, patient was at the kitchen table with his head between his knees trying to breathe, passed out, hit the floor and put a big bump on his head). On 02Apr2021, the patient experienced brain fog at 14:30, swelling at 14:30, swollen glands at 02:30, loss of taste and smell to some extent at 14:30 and too sick to get out of bed. On day 2 (02Apr2021) and was still about pushing 100 degrees Fahrenheit and on 21Apr2021 (after 21 days) sometimes over sometimes less. On the following Monday (05Apr2021), he struggled back to school after 5 days, but came home early. He has just been trashed, too trashed to train for his sport, further described as too weak to train, he hadn&#39;t trained for 3 weeks. He still has a fever. His local doctor did not have any suggestions other than he should take acetaminophen and ibuprofen alternately to get rid of the headache and fever. In 2021, the patient experienced 2-inch diameter raised circle at injection site and disappeared after 10 days and there was a time he could not barely remember his name, tried to study but just wasn&#39;t there, head on desk. Still has difficulty focusing and doing his calculus. It was reported that the time to recover from any exertion seems to be longer by a lot. On 01Apr2021, body temperature reached 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient tried to do a few things like a week ago just because he couldn&#39;t stand to be in the house anymore he took a bike out for about 15 minutes and was just trashed from that experience and took 3 days to recover. The events did not require emergency room visit nor physician&#39;s office neither hospitalized. The outcome was recovered from loss of consciousness, head injury on 01Apr2021; from illness on 02Apr2021; from headache on 04Apr2021; from chills on 06Apr2021; from pain in arm and fatigue on 07Apr2021; from erythema on 11Apr2021; from ageusia and anosmia on 14Apr2021; from lymphadenopathy on 16Apr2021; from arthralgia on 17Apr2021; from myalgia on 18Apr2021; from leg pain on 21Apr2021; from vaccination site swelling in 2021; then recovered with sequel from dyspnoea on 05Apr2021 and from swelling on 07Apr2021; then recovering from pyrexia, feeling abnormal; then not recovered from asthenia and unknown for the remaining events.

He started experiencing symptoms on 5/6/2021 morning a t06:07 AM.  He received his second dose of  Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 5/4/2021 10:: AM.  In the ED, CBC, CMP and UA was within normal limits. EKG at 20:46  and again at 21:14 showed  ST segment elevation in inferolateral leads with possible myocardial injury, ischemia or pericarditis.  Troponin 0 hour was 835 and at 2 hours 1674.  Patient was admitted to the PICU for further evaluation and management. Echo on 5/6/2021 showed normal LV systolic function with SF 31%  . Cardiac MRI on 5/7 showed contrast enhancement of inferolateral wall consistent with myo-pericarditis with small pericardial effusion.  Troponins were trended every 12 hours and plateaued in the 1800&#39;s on 5/8/2021. Patient was diagnosed with acute myo-pericarditis. Respiratory viral PCR and COVID-19 PCR on 05/06/2021 were negative. Thyroid studies were normal. ANA titer is pending. Viral serology for HbsAg was negative and HIV was non-reactive. Results for additional viral serologies for Coxsackie viruses, EBV, CMV and HHV6 are awaited. Patient was treated with  NSAIDs and Colchicine. IVIG was not given based on clinical judgement. Pediatric Cardiology was involved in patient&#39;s care and clinical decision making. Patient remained hemodynamically stable on room air throughout his PICU course.

                                                Child woke up at 3 am with severe nausea. Within minutes he complained about not being able to breathe. His lips turned blue and he was about to pass out. As I was able to keep him awake, I am not sure whether he would have had a febrile seizure (it very much looked like it) or just fainted. The fever spike was too fast, and his body couldn&#39;t handle it. His extreme nausea persisted for four hours (but he didn&#39;t vomit). He was completely debilitated. Fever spiked to 103 but stabilized at 102 for the following 24 hrs.

On Thursday 4/29/2021, he developed &#34;heartburn&#34;, and on Friday 4/30/2021 he developed chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

                                                Patient was given first dose and was in waiting area for observation.  About ten minutes after his shot our vaccine coordinator alerted me that he was having a reaction. When I went out to the patient his eyes were open but he was staring blankly. His father was shaking him and waving his hand in front of his face and asking him if he was okay and the patient was not responding. I also tried to get the patient to respond and he did not. Since the patient was not responsive to any questions we called 911. While waiting on the paramedics to arrive the patient came around and started to answer some simple questions. He was clammy and sweating and he threw up one time. When the paramedics arrived they took over. They checked all the patients vital signs  and were with him for about 15 or 20 minutes assessing him. The patient walked out of the store on his own and was not taken by ambulance.   I called the patient around 3:10pm to check on him and I spoke with him and he said he was doing fine.

My physical examination reveals multiple rather large bruises to the bilateral lower extremities up to softball size worse on the right than left.  Patient had some mild left upper quadrant discomfort.  Very minimal bleeding in the posterior pharynx.   I personally reviewed the labs and CBC revealed an anemia at 10.830.5 hemoglobin hematocrit respectively.  Most notably a 9000 thrombocytopenia.  CMP essentially unremarkable.  INR 1.5 PTT normal.  I added on Lyme disease and tick-borne illness as well as a Monospot type and screen.   Patient did receive his 1st visor vaccine for COVID-19 on April 29, 2021.   IV was established in the emergency department in consultation made to Pediatric Oncology.     I spoke with pediatric oncology in regards to patient&#39;s history and present illness.  He does agree that the patient should in fact be transferred under the pediatric care but recommended under the general hospitalist service.  He did not advise to proceed with any active treatment in our emergency department such as gamma globulin, platelets or steroids.   Awaited call back from pediatric hospitalist and spoke with Dr.  She has agreed to accept the patient in transfer.   Patient and family are comfortable disposition plan no further questions at this time.   Impression: 1.

Fever did not go away without medication. Medication would alleviate it but it continued for 6 days, reaching 102.4.  Pediatrician tested for strep and for COVID, both were negative.  Sore throat persisted after fevers subsided.  Had to finally be prescribed magic mouthwash. Doctor said sores on lips were herpes so prescribed viral medications.  My son never has a sore throat and has never had a herpes sore until after the shot.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable reporter reporting for her son, via Pfizer sponsored program.  A 16-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose at the age of 16-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.   The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  After 24 hours from vaccination, on 25Apr2021, he felt pain on the injection site. For that, the mother gave her son Tylenol to treat the symptoms. Then after 24 hours, on 26Apr2021 he felt fine. However, 2 days after, on 28Apr2021, he felt pain underneath the left side of his armpit, had a fever with a temperature of 102.8 F, and the right side of his neck was swollen. In addition to this, he was experiencing a lot of body aches, headache, and pain on his neck. They already contacted their HCP and prescribed him with antibiotics in Apr2021. He was tired and almost lethargic in Apr2021. Reporter wanted to know if her son should still receive the 2nd dose. The reporter was invited to consult her HCP. The outcome of pain on the injection site was recovering, of all other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Neck swelling, Armpit pain, and Fever cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old male presenting to hospital as a transfer for chest pain and elevated Troponin levels concerning for myocarditis. Patient has otherwise been healthy. Two days ago he received his second dose of COVID vaccination. He initially felt fine, but later that day had some body aches. The next day he felt feverish off and on and had dull left upper sternal border chest pain intermittently. Today, he reports sharp 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, lightheadedness, sweating, chills, and intermittent non-productive cough. He presented to original hospital for evaluation. The patient admits to tactile warmth since Sunday with no documented temperatures. He recently received his second dose of Pfizer just before onset of these symptoms. He reports difficulty sleeping since Sunday, but no shortness of breath, rashes, syncope, nausea, or vomiting. He has not had any other recent illness, fevers, or known COVID-19 exposures. He denies any history of prior cardiac disease and there is no known family history of cardiac disease, arrhythmias, or sudden death in the child or adolescent period. He denies illicit or recreational drug use. In the ED, he was well appearing with pain now 1 out of 10. POC troponin was 16.8 ng/mL. He had labs pertinent for ESR 10, CRP 3.0, BNP 24. RP2 PCR was negative. UDS was negative except for opiates (s/p morphine). IV was placed and patient was started on IV fluids. EKG was obtained and showed questionable left atrial enlargement per ED read. Cardiology was consulted and performed Echocardiogram in the ED at bedside and was within normal limits. Cardiology resident team contacted for admission. Past Medical History: No major medical diagnoses Past Surgical History: Orchiopexy, T&amp;A Family History: No cardiac family history Social History: Lives at home with mother. Has two healthy siblings not living at home Immunizations: Up to date Medications: None Allergies: NKDA Etiology of likely myocarditis remains unclear at this time. In his age group, this would most likely represent a viral myocarditis. He would likely benefit from cardiac MRI during this admission for further evaluation of myocarditis. His EKG findings with his age group are unlikely to be secondary to myocardial infarct. No arrhythmias or heart block noted on EKG at time of admission or telemetry in ED. There is no family history of autoimmune disease or cardiac disease to suggest an autoimmune component or genetic etiology.

He refused to take Tylenol that day, unlike his 14 year sister who had the same symptoms. On Sunday morning (the 3rd day) he woke up &amp; told us he was having chest pain &amp; shortness of breath. His sister was doing fine. So I gave him Tylenol at 10am to try to reduce any inflammation &amp; he still had a fever of 100. About an hour later his fever had reduced to 99 but he was still having slight chest pain &amp; shortness of breath ... mainly if he walked or moved around. He didn?t want to get it checked out but I called our insurance &amp; they agreed that he should go to the ER for testing so we went there at around 3pm. He had testing done including EKG, chest X-ray &amp; COVID-19 test which all came back negative &amp; other lab tests that also came back negative.  They gave him some meds &amp; about 2 1/2 hours later diagnosed him with pleurisy.  He still was having slight chest pain &amp; shortness of breath when we left at 5:30pm but throughout the evening was getting better. We gave him Motrin before bed &amp; another Motrin this morning before school, even though he said he was feeling better.

A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15May2021 (Lot Number: EW0177, at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart murmur. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical Vaccine included 2 vaccines in Mar2021 (Caller said that her son had 2 vaccines in Mar2021 on his annual doctor visit, she did not have the names of the vaccines and then had a booster for the vaccine 4 weeks later. The booster was 14 days prior to receiving the Covid vaccine), and meningococcal vaccine on 01May2021 (at the age of 16-year-old, Caller said that it was a meningococcal vaccine. She thought there were 2 different meningococcal vaccines). Caller was a consumer that was calling on behalf of her son that received his first dose of the Covid-19 Vaccine. She said that she saw on the news recently that Pfizer was looking into reports that teenagers were developing heart issues after receiving the vaccine. The caller said that her son was 16 years old and received his first dose on 15May2021. The caller said that her son had a really small heart murmur. When they got home later that day after he received the vaccine on 15May2021, he said that he had chest pain. She said that he did not have a fever, but was very fatigued and very sluggish for a couple of days. She said that this had been on her mind since she saw it on the news. She was concerned if he should get the second dose on 05Jun2021 with his pediatrician. The caller also said that because he turned 16 in Mar2021, he recently had 2 other vaccines and he had a booster. So he had 3 shots prior to having the Covid-19 Vaccine. The caller said that he received the Covid-19 Vaccine after 14 days of receiving the booster. The caller said that the fatigue and feeling sluggish lasted a couple of days, but stated that he was still tired a lot. The caller said that her son also reported that he had a sore arm. She said that he noticed it a couple of hours after his vaccination and lasted about 3 days. He had completely recovered from the sore arm. The outcome of the event chest pain was unknown, of event fatigue was not recovered, of event sluggish was recovering, of the event sore arm was recovered on 18May2021.

Initially on 6/10-6/11 had expected myalgias and headaches post vaccination similar to dose #1, but later 6/11 developed chest pain that made it impossible for him to sleep. It was waxing and waning but continued through 6/12 which after discussion with PMD ultimately led to referral into our facility for further evaluation. Received a dose of ibuprofen with marked symptomatic relief. No further medications given during his time, his chest pain had resolved after that ibuprofen dose and was at clinical baseline until discharge on 6/15. Prolonged hospital course was to arrange for cardiac MRI to be done for comparison. Otherwise had serial labs (documented below) which had trended in the right direction.

                                                16yo previously healthy male presenting with chest pain. He received second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday at 3p. That evening, he developed fevers, chills and had trouble sleeping. On Thursday, he began feeling heart palpitations and again slept. Overnight, he developed midline chest pain, and decided to present to the emergency room. His EKG showed elevated ST segments. Labs were remarkable for elevated troponin, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP; echo showed normal function but subtle hypokinesis of the apex. He was given morphine, Tylenol, Ketorolac, 1L NS, and possibly aspirin before being transferred to the ED.   In our ED, he had a reassuring exam, was no longer reporting chest pain. He had labs drawn which showed a white count to 15.3, normal H/H, Plt 152, ESR 12, CRP 10, and Trop T 1.14.   Aside from the above symptoms, he has been in his usual well state without viral symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, joint pain, or other symptoms. He has no past medical or surgical history. Immunizations are up to date. His social history is benign.  Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. An echocardiogram was performed which showed mild LV systolic dysfunction. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV q12h. He remained asymptomatic with no chest pain throughout his admission. He was transitioned over to PO steroids on 6/13 which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were trending down. Cardiac MRI showed an area of late gadolinium enhancement in the LV, with no abnormal function.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake including tolerance of PO steroid. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology to be arranged. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  - Prednisone  - Famotidine Patient was admitted for management of myocarditis thought to be due to his SARS-CoV2 vaccination. He received IVIG and steroids. He had multiple EKGs, echocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI. He showed improvement during his hospitalization. He will be followed closely by Cardiology who will advise return to exercise and repeat imaging needs.  **Please note that we do not have access to the vaccination records (lot, etc)**

                                                The day following the second Pfizer shot the patient developed a fever to 101.5 that improved with Tylenol and did not recur.  On that same day he felt tingling in the hands and feet and reported a floating sensation.  This too resolved with resolution of fever.  On the third day after the shot he developed chest pain, difficulty taking a deep breath.  He woke up the following morning with nausea which resolved but the chest pain and a feeling that it was hard to take a deep breath worsened.  The pain was significant enough that he went to the ER.  In the ER, he was found to have an ECG consistent with acute pericarditis and his troponin was elevated (2.75, upper limits of normal 0.03).  He was started on IV Toradol and admitted to the hospital.  His troponin kept climbing so he was also given IVIG (80 gm).  The following morning his Troponin started coming down and he no longer was reporting any symptoms.

Headache, mild aching in the arms and legs, lack of desire to eat, and extreme tiredness also. Inflammation of the lining of the heart was the primary side effect and very concerning. Pain began the day after the immunization.  It was significantly worse in the morning and mid-day.  Pain would lessen during the day, but increase over night again. Most symptoms were gone within 5 days.  Minor aches remain after 1 week.

                                                Exactly seven days after patient second vaccine, he boarded a 9:10AM flight, with his Dad and sister. Approximately 90 minutes into the flight, as patient watched a movie on his phone (which did not have a photosensitivity warning), he blacked out and doesn&#39;t remember anything else until after coming out of a seizure. What others saw, including his father (my husband), was a convulsing 16 year-old (nearly 6&#39; tall and 155 pounds), who was sitting just in front of him, between two strangers. My husband quickly realized what was happening and was totally surprised and struck with some fear, as we have NEVER seen a seizure in our family or in patient before (we have six biological children). The airline called for medical help; a doctor and some other professionals came. My husband had EMT training many years ago, so didn&#39;t hold patient body, but did work a few times to keep his head up (patient was seated), so as not to allow the airway to close. Patient sister (age 18) was across the aisle, alone, watching all of the commotion take place, not knowing what to do or how to help, in tears, but handling it with poise and independence. After about 2-3 minutes, the intense convulsing stopped, and his seizure became quieter but still had movement. His eyes were rolled back and he was foaming a bit at the mouth. He was still not responsive. This went on for about 4-5 minutes. Then he stopped. His dad and the doctor asked him basic questions like, &#34;who are you?&#34; &#34;how old are you?&#34; &#34;where are you?&#34; He couldn&#39;t answer any other those. Another 3-5 minutes past, and finally he was able to answer &#34;where are you?&#34; with &#34;I&#39;m right here.&#34; Slowly, he came back to his &#34;senses&#34; but of course, was very tired and had a horrible headache afterward. The doctor and my husband decided it was best to have the plane divert to another city  to get patient to a hospital as soon as possible. The three of them had to cancel their trip (work trip for my husband, which our 18- and 16-year-old children were accompanying him on for pleasure and travel). The Airlines was awesome about the whole thing. When the plane landed, they quickly escorted the three off the plane (patient walked slowly, then was put in a wheelchair when they got right off the plane). They were then transferred into an Ambulance and emergently sent to the Hospital. After several hours of waiting and testing, and patient not having any more seizure activity, his CT scan, blood tests, and chest x-ray were normal,  so he was discharged with the instruction to get an MRI with and without contrast upon arrival back home, and then to follow up with a Neurologist. He has been home nearly a week now and feels like himself. He has had the MRI, which came back normal (yay!), but we are waiting to see a Neurologist at hospital. The ONLY thing in patient life that had changed for him in the days, weeks, months preceding this super surprising event, was his Covid #2 Pfizer vaccine. That is why we, and our supportive doctor, are suspicious that this may have been the cause. We are a little nervous about whether or not more seizures will take place, or perhaps his body is done dealing with his probably strong reaction to the immunologic/inflammatory variable. Maybe altitude could have played in, along with the vaccine, and been the straws that broke the camel&#39;s back of other things maybe brewing? But we don&#39;t think so. patient has had NO health issues, other than an appendix out 3 years ago! Thanks for listening. We want this variable to you as a data point.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Second dose of Pfizer vaccine received Friday afternoon (4/2/2021). Went to bed Friday evening with &#34;normal&#34; side effects of mild fever and sore arm at injection site. Woke up Saturday morning with no sense of smell or taste. Called primary care provider who conducted a video visit and expressed concern that he may have had an asymptomatic case of COVID-19 prior to injection (no symptoms displayed at all in weeks prior). Order a COVID test for Sunday morning. Woke up Sunday morning with sense of taste and smell back. Proceeded with PCR test, which came back as &#34;negative&#34; on Sunday evening. No other symptoms observed, and other side effects noted above (sore arm, fever) resolved by Sunday morning as well. Seems to suggest loss of sense of taste and smell likely due to vaccine since there was a clear temporal relationship which resolved in approximately 24 hours.

His chin was pinned to his chest, he struggled to breath and was making a sound as if he was loudly snoring but seemed to be struggling to breathe. I was unable to wake him. I&#39;m not sure how long it lasted but maybe 2 minutes or so. He woke up and asked what was going on as we had all been standing over him trying to unsuccessfully wake him.  He shared that he thought he&#39;d been asleep and had been dreaming. He also shared that his throat hurt very much. He had the shakes for about 30 minutes after and was extremely exhausted. He slept for 14 hours as soon as we arrived home.

Then he started to seem like he might pass out.  Then he was shaking for a few moments and his body straightened out on the chair and he seemed like he might be having a seizure.  I had someone call 9-1-1. I stayed with him until the paramedics arrived.  He kept seeming like he was nodding off, but when I spoke to him he was responsive.  By the time the paramedics arrived he said he was feeling better, but they checked him out, BP and HR and blood O2 were normal.  The paramedics offered transport to hospital but patient and his adult family member declined, and patient went home with his family member.

He saw his pediatrician on 4/26 and a CT scan of his neck with IV contrast was done and this showed significant diffuse right-sided deep spatial neck edema and right-sided adenopathy.  The pediatrician discussed the findings with ENT who recommended augmentin and a medrol dosepak.  The patient developed a headache several days after this and went to urgent care for evaluation.  There was concern that the augmentin and steroids had caused the headache, so the steroids were stopped and he was switched to keflex on 4/30.  He was given phenergan and toradol at Urgent Care and discharged home.  His mom notes that several days ago he had fevers of 101-104.  He has not had a fever for several days now.  His headache continued and he felt unwell at basketball practice so he returned to urgent care on 5/4.  A CT scan of his head was done which showed right sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis as well as thrombophlebitis of the right IJ. He was sent to ED for further management at that time.  In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable and well-appearing.  The CTs were overread by our radiologists here.  The patient had some labs done at the outside urgent care but PT/PTT/INR and a CRP were drawn here, which were unremarkable.  A Covid PCR is negative.  Neurosurgery, neurology, and hematology were consulted.  Neurology recommended heparin and a hypercoagulable workup and hematology agreed with this plan.  The patient was admitted to the ICU for neuro checks and monitoring during initiation of heparin.

A 17-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Apr2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EW1064) as SINGLE DOSE  (at age of 17 years old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included epilepsy (interactable epilepsy) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications.  Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1 on 25Mar2021 09:00, lot number as ER8733,  in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation(at age of 17 years old). On 17Apr2021, the patient experienced increased seizure activity, fatigue/tired, confusion and memory issues. After the 2nd shot, about 4-5 hours, he experienced increased seizure activity and it has progressed to today, today he is a little bit better but it has progressed to point he is having a lot of confusion and memory issues. He has several different types of seizures but he has what are called mini seizures, the blank stare, the confusion. Nothing has stopped completely, he isn&#39;t back to his baseline as far as his seizures. He always has seizures, daily so she is calling about the increased activity and when she says his baseline she means he has not returned back to his baseline activity, but he is doing better than yesterday.  Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were horrible. Today he started to get back to his normal self. The events did not require a visit to the Emergency Room or Physician Office. Outcome of the increased seizure activity/mini seizures, confusion and memory issues were recovering. Outcome of fatigue/tired were not recovered.

                                                The day after the vaccination started hives.  But it was slow so thought could be food allergic reaction. Over a period of 2 weeks it developed never went off.  Noticing the hives   getting worse and the epsode starting day after vaccination suspected it the cause and so went to primary care physician.  She diagnosed the hives related to medical side effects and only medical related item he had within the last 1 year was this vaccine.  She put him on Methylprednisolone for 6 days along with Cetirizine HCL 10mg.  The hives appeared to be suppressed for the first 3 days where the dose was higher, however, when the dosage was getting lower after day 3 it came back with high intensity.  Lips, fingers, tongue...swollen and with fever running at upto 101.6.  Again went to the doctor, she put him on Prednisone with 40 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 3 days, 10mg for 3 days and 10mg alternate days.  It literally took more than 1 and half month still not recovered.  Hives are still on and also severe cold with mucus and cough started since (05/09/21).  Fever show up on and off even now.  We&#39;re referred to allergy specialists.  She asked to not take 2nd dose.  Increased dosage of Antihistamines, asked to continue Prednisone 10mg for 6 more day daily 10mg and if cold and cough does go in the next 2 days may put on antibiotics.

We took his blood pressure twice and his heart rate was 105 bpm..  Can not exactly remember blood pressure (seemed very off).  Took pt to the hospital where they measured his heart rate at 107 bpm.

He received the COVID vaccine 5 days ago in the afternoon and initially had what he expected to be normal side effects from the vaccine that evening. Symptoms included body aches, runny nose and general malaise. However, over the last few days he has felt worse and developed more congestion, cough, and sweating. He did improve a little bit 2 days ago but then started to feel worse yesterday and had a worsening cough that is resulting in some chest tightness. Cough is productive sounding. Mom describes it as barking. No appreciable wheezing but he sounds hoarse. He has some SOB after coughing repeatedly. He states it simply feels like it is hard to breathe for 10-20minutes after a coughing attack but then it resolves. He developed sweating yesterday as well. He states he will just start sweating for no reason. No measured fever. No chills. Today he has dried skin and cracked lips from blowing/wiping his nose all the time. No fevers. No vomiting.

Patient sat down in the chair and rolled sleeve up. Chose L deltoid for injection site. He was talking with a friend and writer gave injection. Placed band aid. Patient was quiet and looked like he was going to get up but fell forward out of the chair. He hit his L forehead on side of wall. Writer caught patient and sat him up on the ground. Eye?s were dilated, he was diaphoretic, zoned out and not responding initially to voice, but eyes were open. Eventually got patient up to a wheelchair and taken to office area to lay down and monitor. Father was notified and sat with us after he arrived at the school. Patient drank 1 full 120cc orange juice and approximately 6oz of water. Throughout monitoring patient gradually felt better. Pupils corrected to normal, wasn?t diaphoretic anymore, and vitals improved. He stated this has happened before with lab draws and shots, but not this severe. Writer and colleagues informed him to notify people that are going to give him shots or lab draws about his history. Also informed him to notify his teachers if he feels anything out the ordinary for the rest of the day. Make sure he hydrates. Patient then sat up and walked in the room. He stated he felt fine like before getting the shot. Patient left stable and under his own power.

I did a bunch of research however I did not find anything about chest pain related to the second dose of Pfizer. I am not sure if it is some type of tissue or muscle pain or something more serious. When I massage my chest it does not ache like the muscle pain from my shoulder so id assume it has to do with maybe my lungs or heart.

                                                came to see me 3 days after his first Pfizer Covid vaccine and had been having a subjective fever, bad headache and stomach ache since the day the vaccine was administered. He incidentally had some weight loss noted at the visit over the previous 6 months for which I did some lab work. The lab work was normal except for his platelet count which was 111,000. A repeat platelet count done a week later was normal at 273,000. Because of the transient decrease in platelet count and the 3 days of bad headache after the vaccine, I decided to hold off on  getting a second Covid vaccine. Additionally and possibly of no significance, his mother apparently had a history of ITP during her childhood.

                                                17-year old M with history of recurrent ear infections requiring PE tube placement who was in his usual state of health until 5/5 when he noticed a new itchy hive-like rash. He was short of breath 5/6, and developed fevers that night along with vomiting. He was seen 5/6 with negative COVID19 PCR and documented fever to 104. Fevers continued, and he was admitted the evening of 5/10 with concern for myocarditis. See below for hospital course. Additional information for Item 18: ...Screening labs were notable for mild lymphopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and elevated inflammatory markers.  Given prior COVID infection, rash, and systemic inflammation, additional studies including troponin, D-dimer, BNP, and EKG were obtained.  EKG was reassuringly normal, however the D-dimer (2.48), troponin (1.27), and BNP (469) were elevated.  Other work-up included chest x-ray which was unremarkable, and right upper quadrant ultrasound with incidental cavernous hemangioma of the liver.  He was started on milrinone (5/11-5/12) after initial TTE was concerning for severely diminished LV function. Follow-up TTE 12 hours later was normal (on milrinone), and remained so after milrinone was discontinued 5/12. Follow-up TTE after discontinuation remained normal. Cardiac MRI was completed 5/14, although read remains pending. He received IVIG on 5/11, and was started on methylpred 50 mg IV BID, Anakinra 100 mg SQ BID 5/14,  and transitioned to prednisone 30 mg PO BID with clinical improvement, down-trending troponin and systemic inflammatory labs.  Subsequent CBCs have been notable for rising leukocytosis (5/16 WBC 56.3) and thrombocytosis (5/16 plts 690) and 4&#43; spherocytes (with no known personal or prior history of spherocytosis). He will likely be discharged 5/17.   Infectious evaluation was unrevealing including cultures and viral studies. COVID spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were sent, but remain pending. Pt. initial COVID-19 infection was diagnosed October 2020, with positive saliva PCR testing.  He was symptomatic for 3-5 days.  He received his second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine 4/27 in his left arm; denies any significant reactions (arm swelling, injection site redness, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, fatigue, or fever). He has had passing contact with school classmates who have recently been diagnosed with COVID19.

She says that on 5/6, pt complained of L arm weakness during cooking class at school, which was followed by a mild L sided headache later in the day. Symptoms resolved without intervention but recurred on 5/8 with associated L sided facial droop, slurred speech, L arm spasms, and L foot drag.  Pt was seen at  ED for this and had a HA (5/10 in severity) at that time -- workup was unremarkable with a normal head CT, laboratory workup, and resolution of symptoms. Pediatric Neurology evaluated the pt, deemed no further workup necessary, and advised outpatient follow up.   Pt presented again to the ED on 5/10 with concern for full tonic/clonic seizure, witnessed by pt?s mother. Mother reports that she heard pt fall and went upstairs to find pt seizing on his bed -- says that pt had shaking of bilateral upper extremities (in flexed position close to chest) and symmetric lower extremity shaking; eyes were closed without clear focality or eye deviation. Also some drooling, though no incontinence or tongue biting. Episode lasted for approximately 2 minutes; pt was confused and did not recall what happened immediately afterwards but improved within the next 8 minutes. He was taken to the ED by EMS.   By the time he arrived in the ED, he had left sided weakness again. He was given Keppra 1g, placed on EEG, and was admitted. EEG overnight was read &#34;normal&#34; and additional workup was unremarkable. Pt had MRI brain completed showing cortical abnormalities in the R parietal lobe, suspected to be related to recent seizure. MRA showed patent intracranial cerebral vasculature. MRV showed no evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis. Weakness resolved by the morning and pt was back to baseline on morning of 5/11/21. However, around 9 AM, L sided weakness (face, arm&gt;leg) with associated headache recurred. Mom says that this event was captured on EEG. He was then transferred to our facility. He was placed on pEEG and had repeat labs, imaging completed. Pt did have L sided facial droop, L arm weakness, and slurred speech on arrival, but this resolved within 24 hours. Pt had one additional episode of &#34;wave&#34; of L sided weakness including L sided facial droop and slurred speech at one other time during the hospitalization, but no additional seizure like activity. He was discharged on 5/14 with a normal neuro exam-- some labs (including labs of Rheum and Id workup were pending at time of discharge.) Primary and consulting teams elected to forgo steroids but reconsider should symptoms worsen or return. Pt was readmitted on 5/16-- had an episode of expressive aphasia &#43; headache while at a social gathering; states that he became overwhelmed by the noise. No additional seizure like activity.

                                                17 y.o. male who presents with chest pain, elevated troponins and diffuse ST elevations concerning for pericarditis vs myocarditis admitted for cardiac monitoring and evaluation. Pt states he has had 1 day of sudden onset L shoulder pain and chest pain. Endorses dyspnea due to pain with deep breaths, denies tachypnea, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. Endorses mild chills and aches after COVID vaccine 3 days prior to onset of symptoms, denies any fever, URI symptoms, diarrhea, rash, known COVID contacts. Pain continued to worsen and spread across his chest, causing presentation to ED this afternoon. No history of PE, DVT, long travel, recent surgery, malignancy, alcohol or cocaine use. Significant cardiac history in family: dad with CAD w/LAD blockage, both parents with hypertension.    At ED, labs notable for elevated troponin 0.456, repeat 0.67 and diffuse ST elevations on EKG concerning for pericarditis. COVID neg, CXR unremarkable, blood cx drawn, no abx started. Patient was given toradol for pain with minimal improvement. Peds cardiology was consulted and patient was transferred to different ED for further care.   At different ED, repeat EKG showed similar diffuse ST elevations in I, II, aVL. Repeat troponins uptrending (4.91), proBNP 562, ESR 43, CRP 18. Mildly tachycardic but otherwise hemodynamically stable. Given tylenol for pain. Cardiology recommended admission for trending troponins, echo and cardiac monitoring.  CV: Troponins were trended every 12 hours with a max of 4.91.  His last troponin checked on the morning of discharge was 0.41.  He had an echo that showed normal cardiac function, an MRI that indicated normal ventricular size and function, with minimal or healing and inflammation or mild myocarditis.  During his admission, he had continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring, that did not show any arrhythmias.   Resp: On 2L NC for comfort, no respiratory distress or hypoxia.   FENGI: Regular diet   Neuro: Ibuprofen scheduled and tylenol PRN for pain.  He was initially started on ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, but was starting to have pain prior to being due for medicine every 8 hours so his regimen was changed to 600 mg every 6 hours which controlled his pain adequately.   ID: Myocarditis panel sent with some results still pending.  Thus far, he is CMV negative, EBV IgG was positive but not IgM.  RVP was negative.  This all occurred in the setting receiving the Covid vaccine 3 days prior to presentation, which has been reported as a rare reaction to the Covid vaccine.  At the time of discharge, labs pending results include mycoplasma pneumonia, coxsackie, parvovirus, enterovirus. Etiology of myocarditis remains unclear at this time, could be related to infectious etiology not yet clear to us, vs related to his COVID vaccine prior to admission.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine in the morning, then woke at about midnight. He went to get a drink of water, and was holding a glass of water in his hand. He started to feel as if the room was spinning, became very sweaty, had ringing in both ears, and lost consciousness, striking his head on the counter. The event was unwitnessed. He reports waking approximately 1 hour later with a bad headache. He had a headache and felt disoriented. He denies urinary/bowel incontinence or tongue biting. He was able to walk back to his room without difficulty, took ibuprofen, and went back to sleep. He woke the next morning with nausea and vomited, but this did not impact his headache. He has not had any notable neurologic symptoms since that time, but continues to have a minor headache. He has not had any further vomiting. Headache has not subsequently woken him from sleep and does not worsen with recumbent positioning. He denies visual changes, memory changes, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, ringing in his ears, or dizziness. He says his headache is located mostly around his forehead and at the top of his head that is now mild and feels like pressure ?like a tension type headache.? His mother is a nurse, and evaluated him the next day. The family did not feel that he needed to be seen in the emergency department, or prior to this visit. He has not had any previous episodes that were similar. Patient was evaluated in my clinic. Complete neurologic exam was within normal limits. He has been referred to neurology for further assessment.

He had fever and headache for about 24-36 hours, which he had also had after the first dose of the vaccine. On 5/23, he woke up with constant substernal chest pain, which worsened with exertion and deep inspiration. The pain increased throughout the day. In the ED, he was found to have elevated troponin ,CK-MB,  elevated CPK, and elevated liver enzymes. EKG was concerning for ST elevation initially.  Bedside echocardiogram showed low-normal function, normal coronaries, trace effusion, and no evidence of RV strain. Troponin and NT pro BNP were increased upon admission to our facility. Repeat ECHO showed borderline global hypokinesis of the LV with an LVEF of 51%. He received IVIG on 5/24/21 and also was started on ketorolac on 5/24/21. Troponin and CK were trending downwards at the time of this submission.

                                                Patient received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 5/7/21. On 5/13/21 he began to feel feverish (unsure Tmax, never took temperature) and was intermittently febrile until hospital admission on 5/20/21. On 5/18/21 he was seen in the ED for fever and tested positive for strep throat and started on amoxicillin. His inflammatory labs were elevated at this time and did not notice improvement on amoxicillin. He returned to the ED on 5/20/21 at which time patient reported headaches on the right side, sharp 7/10 pain which come and go with the fevers as well as fatigue, muscle/body aches, and sweats in addition to persistent fever. He also noticed maculopapular rash on palms and soles and on distal extremities which was not pruritic or painful on day of hospital admission. All infectious workup was negative and patient did not improve on broad spectrum antibiotics. Given his persistent fever, hypotension, and inflammatory labs without other cause, patient was empirically treated for MIS-C and was given IVIG and methylprednisolone as well as being started on prophylactic dose enoxaparin for his elevated D-dimer. Repeat echocardiogram identified a new coronary aneurysm, supporting the diagnosis of MIS-C. Following IVIG and steroids patient remained afebrile and inflammatory markers down trended, however liver enzymes remained elevated at time of discharge. He improved and was discharged to finish steroid course at home with close follow up.

Because he was reporting for work to a camp, he reported to the camp nurse. After conferring with parents, he reported to Hospital for testing. EKG there was normal; minimal labwork performed - Troponin test requested by parent came back at 0.03.  Advil taken earlier had resolved pain at that time, but pain was persistent the following day. Parent retrieved patient, and he reported to his pediatrician at the PCP Clinic and more labwork was performed at approximately 10 a.m.  Troponin level had increased to 14, with other inflammatory markers elevated and abnormal EKG result.  Pediatrician consulted with pediatric cardiologists, and parents were advised to proceed to the ER.  Mother arrived with Hospital at approximately 5:30 p.m.  Troponin results from 6:45 elevated to 16.  Ped. Cardiologist performed echo-cardiogram, which showed no abnormal heart functioning. Ped. Cardiolgist diagnosed myocarditis and prescribed 15-hour IVIg infusion.  As of Wednesday, 5/26, at noon, troponin level had decreased to 10.8 and other inflammatory markers were improving. Patient is currently still hospitalized in the  ICU Step Down Unit at Hospital.

Initial symptoms presented with rhinorrhea, then severee headache, neck pain, and fever (tactile). Had sweats and chills. Began to experience diarrhea, dysuria, diffue body aches and myalgias. Severe pain in his neck / posterior occiput. Denied any mental status changes at the time.   Studies largely negative for an identifiable bacterial process so presumptive diagnosis is aseptic meningitis. Unclear if from vaccine or other etiologies. Outside hospital had started antibiotics but this was stopped and patient symptomatically recovered with only symptomatic care.

                                                Thursday started with sore throat, fever, chills, stuffy nose and headache. We gave him Acetaminophen. Fever continued into Friday with the same symptoms. Hives began Saturday morning and gradually got worse. We gave him Benadryl at that time and the fever went up to 102.5 F. Wheezing in his chest began. Sunday morning the hives were worse and we decided to go to the doctor. We went to a walk in clinic who after an EKG wanted us to go to the Emergency room due to a &#34;blip&#34; and a concern for myocarditis. At the ER they administered Prednisone and more Benadryl through an IV.  They decided to do a CT Scan to look for blood clots. (the ER doctor mentioned he was glad that we brought him into the ER...) No blood clots were found thankfully and they eventually released him, with a prescription for 4 days for  Prednisone, more Benadryl and Pepcid. The hives continue today, the day after, and are barely under control by the Benadryl.

I told him to drink more water and I gave him some Tylenol. I told him to keep me posted as to how he felt. The next morning, he said he hadn&#39;t slept all night - he had a dull pain that didn&#39;t go away when he moved. It traveled up his upper leg and up to his right hip. Moving and stretching didn&#39;t make it go away. Constant dull pain. I took him to ER. It took 36 -48 hours before it faded. He didn&#39;t wake up with it on Saturday.

The next morning he had a fever of 103, and gave her Tylenol chewable.  The following day he has no fever, in the early at 4:00 AM he woke up with pain on his chest.  He said that he felt weird, tightness on his chest and he could not actually describe it, said it was in the middle of his chest.  It was uncomfortable but uncomfortable and was worried.  They observed him, the pain didn&#39;t go away, just on the chest.  If he tried to sit up he felt better, but when he laid down the pain was always there.  Around 3:00 PM she brought him to the ER and had tests run, and all tests were okay.  His EKG showed ST-elevations and inflammation of the heart.  He had an US of the heart and was discharged home this morning.  He has to be seen by his PCP to be referred to a cardiologist.  He was given some medications and is sleeping right now.  He has an APT with his PCP on 6/9/21.   He was sent home to take Ibuprofen.

A 17-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, #lot: EN6200) via intramuscular route of administration on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 17-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus, ADHD, known allergies: cats and horses, acne and depression. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood immunoglobulin g: negative, blood immunoglobulin m: negative, herpes simplex test: negative. Acyclovir (stopped when HSV 1 and 2 IgG and IgM were neg), sars-cov-2 test: negative on 24Feb2021. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included insulin lispro (HUMALOG) and isotretinoin (ACCUTANE). On 22Feb2021, the patient developed severe swollen glands in his submand region, throat pain, swollen lymph nodes in groin, dehydration, oral lesions, oral ulcers and severely fissured lips, lethargy and body aches. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment was received for all the events. Hydration, discontinued Accutane, gave Acyclovir (stopped when HSV 1 and 2 IgG and IgM were neg). The outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date in 2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Approximately 24 hours  after secondPfizer dose, 17 year old male awoke in the morning and was complaining of intense throat pain radiating into the upper chest  relieved by sitting up.  NSAIDS not helpful, went to narcotic med to relieve, which it did with single tab of medication.  Other symptoms, fatigue, body aches, low fever.  Waxed and waned over 48 hour time period from onset, with another intense episode  of throat/chest pain 24 hours in from onset requiring narcotic pain med to relief.   Again this was in the morning.  One episode of vomiting during second intense period with what looked like water that just hadn&#39;t gone down his throat, and following this he reported some relief from what he described as a radiating burning sensation up under the lower jaw and radiating into the upper chest.  No shortness of breath ever.   Burning sensation in throat and chest resolved by 72 hours with no more episodes of the acute throat and chest pain after the two episodes.  While ED was considered due to the distress being experienced, we decided against since the narcotic med was helping and no shortness of breath was being experienced.  I did try to get on with the CDC to report my concerns when it was happening to see if others were reporting this, then because it was a concerning reaction, but site was difficult to navigate and I was trying to monitor.  I did not call the pediatrician at that time as I am a health care worker and felt I could assess and make decisions based on findings.   Following the recent reports of myocarditis in teens, especially males, I felt obligated to report this experience.   This child has no history of heart ailment.  No tests were done to assess what might have been the cause.  I assumed it was an outside-the-box reaction to the second Pfizer dose.

A 17-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm, at age 17 years, on 12Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0158) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pressure in his eye from an injury, asthma (diagnosed when the patient was about 2) and has family members with asthma and heart conditions. Patient is in perfect health, he works out 6 days a week, and does football conditioning 5 days a week. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available) was none. Concomitant medication included timolol taken for pressure in his eye from an injury from an unspecified start date to 20May2021. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. The patient historically received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number: EP7534) at the left arm at age 17 years on 22Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient got his second dose of the vaccine on 12Apr2021 and shorty after on 19Apr2021, he became very fatigued, very weak, his chest hurt, and he had shortness of breath. On Apr2021, patient had dizziness. The patient used to have bulky arms and now you can see his muscle mass depleting in Apr2021. The patient cannot focus on school online because of the headaches from 19Apr2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure goes up and down from 19Apr2021. For days from 19Apr2021, the patient&#39;s heart rate will be fine in the 60s and it goes up to 120 or 130 with chest pain, it fluctuates depending on the day.  The patient visited the emergency room on 05May2021, but was not admitted and no one knows what was going on with the vaccine. It was also reported that the patient lost 14 pounds on 25Apr2021 since the second dose of the vaccine. They knew the patient has already lost 10 pounds and then yesterday, 25May2021, the patient weighed himself and noticed he has lost another 4 pounds over the weekend. Patient had bloodwork on 20May2021 and it was all negative. The primary care provider was concerned about the weight loss so she ran a bunch of blood work. The patient is negative for COVID test and chest x-ray on 21May2021 and he has had multiple tests done. The patient went to his primary care provider on 25May2021 (yesterday from the time off reporting) and the reporter mentioned that maybe can they look at this as being a side effect from the vaccine. The patient&#39;s doctor laughed and said nothing has been proven yet about this. The reporter felt that this is a reaction to the vaccine. At the time of reporting on 26May2021, the patient was not able to function and sleeps all day. The patient also underwent lab tests and procedures that includes being tested negative for mono twice now (on unspecified dates). Clarified that they have not filed a safety report with Pfizer on the patient&#39;s events. The outcome of the events &#39;dizziness&#39;, &#39;lost 14 pounds since the second dose of the vaccine/lost another 4 pounds over the weekend&#39;, &#39;muscle mass depleting&#39;, &#39;cannot focus on school online&#39;, &#39;not able to function&#39; and &#39;sleeps all day&#39; was unknown; while for the other events, it was not recovered.

                                                He had the second shot, had very mild headache, and then woke up approx 48 hours after 2nd dose, complaining that his &#34; chest hurt&#34;, I asked him to explain the &#34; hurt&#34;, he said his chest felt tight, heavy pressure, like weight on his chest, uncomfortable. He said it went away after a few days... I didn&#39;t realize the inflammation of the heart was a side affect, until I recently heard that was coming up, so I put 2 and 2 together, and thought I had better report.

After 10 minutes sitting down, his mom notified us the patient fell on the floor. He hurt his right eye brown and caused bleeding  and we called 911 . I took the patient sat on the chair in the lobby and tried to clean his opened wound on the eye brown. We gave him drink some water and he felt tired and light dizziness.After 20 minutes, 911 came and checked his pulse, oxygen, and clean his wound. After 30 minutes, patient felt okay and no longer having dizziness and he refused to go to Emergency. He still had pain from hurting eye brown.

The pt was sweating and not responding for about 5 minutes, after the pt was awake and the EMS saw him the pt started feeling much better and did not wan t to go to the  hospital.  The pt only had juice and it was after 1:00pm so this could have been a contributing factor.  The pt stayed 30 more minutes with me after the EMS left and he was completely fine.  I also think the pt since he was a minor was really nervous.

I ran over to make sure the patient was alert and he tried to stand up after falling so we escorted him to a chair and called 911. I waited with the patient until the fire department arrived, the patient was sweating, pale, and seemed to be breathing normally.

He had other flu-like symptoms but he said it was difficult for him to swallow. He still had a fever of 100.9 and it lasted until the fourth day. The following day it was not much better so we went to the doctor and all tests were negative. It was still sore until the fifth day and then it subsided. We tried some Tylenol and Ibuprofen and it helped the fever but not the sore throat. It has been six days and he is fully recovered.

The following morning he felt feverish and achy with malaise. He stayed home, drank fluids and rested and felt well enough to come up to ski this weekend. During skiing he had some anterior chest pain, it resolved and he went about his day. Tonight at 2245 the pain became sharp and awakened him from sleep. He felt nauseated and clammy as well. Father brought him to the ER for evaluation. His emergency department evaluation showed ST elevations most notably in the inferior and lateral leads as well as in the lateral precordium.

                                                Patient was nervous about getting vaccine. Discussed safety profile of vaccine and that many people are tolerating very well. Patient seemed much better after discussion and was ready to get vaccine.  Gave injection and he was doing fine and went to sit down for 30 minutes as recommended. After giving next vaccine about 15 minutes later patient apparently tried to come across waiting room to speak to me and started to fall. Next patient was leaving room and caught patient, preventing injury and called for help.  Multiple staff responded.  Patient reported dizziness and seeing colors.  Was breathing fast but not having any swelling or trouble breathing. Was able to stand after a minute and was taken to clinic that is right next to pharmacy for evaluation. Patient was evaluated and left within the next hour doing well.  Spoke to patient in the afternoon and reports recovering well, has a headache that he thinks is stress related.  Counseled to continue to monitor and seek medical attention if any worsening of symptoms.

Noted the following day this his eyes looked yellow, more that usual, and came to the clinic on 3/1/21 for evaluation.  was feeling better but due to acute jaundice had blood work that indicated markedly elevated bilirubin and low platelets.  Further testing for hepatitis was negative.  Was sent to the ER the following day as we were unable to get blood drawn and GI consult was desired.  There he had a normal abdominal US and bilirubin had dropped and he has since been followed by GI and is currently being evaluated by Hematology for any underlying conditions that may be contributing.

During that time, patient experienced headache and nausea. Patient did mention that he usually eats right after waking up but on 3/31/21 he didnt eat anything in the morning. His parents gave him water and he felt a lot better. Pharmacist called 911 because we thought that his throat was closing up but it was just nausea and his spit was coming up. After the 911 came they checked him out and he was doing okay and felt much better and did not had to go to emergency room. He was okay and then left after 30 minutes of observance. I also called the patient at around 4 pm to make sure he was okay and patient said he was fine and was felling normal like before.

                                                My healthy 18-year old son had his first dose of Pfizer, and within a few minutes he felt dizzy. His heart rate was also rapid. He didn&#39;t think much of it, but the dizziness persisted and so they had him lay down with feet up. After about 20 minutes, he began to vigorously shake (rigors I believe is what it is called.) He felt numb in both arms and also his tongue and mouth. We had 3 nurses attending to him, and after about 30 minutes they decided to send him to the ER for evaluation since the very strong shaking and other symptoms were worsening. The shaking, dizziness, numbness all subsided after about an hour. He was given a Zyrtec upon first symptoms about 15 minutes after dose. The ER doc doesn&#39;t believe it was an allergic reaction but potentially a strong vasovagal response and immune response. He felt tired after but was completely fine 2 hours later. We were discharged from the ER a few hours later after evaluation. Vitals were in normal range including blood sugar, blood pressure and oxygen. He was fully hydrated prior and had a turkey sandwich and orange prior to coming so was not low on food either. The shaking was very extreme and concerning. It has been almost 24 hours and he is feeling fine other than a sore arm.

                                                Patient started complaining of headache and chest pain soon after vaccination.  Since then he has been to the Emergency Room 6-7 times for chest pain - workup is consistently negative He has seen two Cardiologists, a Neurologist and has had further workup.  It should be said that I feel it is probably not vaccine related and is likely anxiety related - however patient insists that it is related to the vaccine - he has never felt like this before.

Question is whether he should get the second shot or not. Is 6 to potentially 8 days of side effects a concern? Also, parent has been curious as to whether son was a long hauler from covid for brain fog but son thinks it could be burnout from school. Strange that  had such a long lasting reaction compared to to others his gneral age, including those who had covid after he had it so longer ago.

                                                Overnight, my (almost 19) son did not wake me, but reported to me in the morning that he had headaches, chills, numbness, thirst, and hallucinations. He was aware that they were not real during and after he had them, but it was a nonetheless disturbing experience.  He described to me having the need to hydrate all night and he drank a lot of water. This morning he was still having a headache and numbness as well as overall malaise, but has taken advil and eaten a light breakfast. He is dressed and up and around and seems to be improving. Should the symptoms return or worsen, we plan to take him for medical care.

                                                Around 10:30 I began to feel tired and a little sick. I went to sleep and at around 2 or 3 am I woke up freezing cold and sweating, with my left arm (arm I got the shot in) hurting a ton. I didn?t fall asleep for a few hours and couldn?t get out of bed due to coldness, lethargy, and muscle soreness. Next day had a moderate headache throughout the day that Ibuprofen didn?t help with. By 10 pm Friday all symptoms other than arm soreness had disappeared.

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Apr2021 at 12:45 (Lot Number: Ew0153) at the age of 18 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included autism spectrum disorder, ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) combined, learning disabilities. The patient had no known allergies. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medication taken within two weeks of vaccination included alfetamine aspartate/alfetamine sulfate/dexamphetamine saccharate/dexamphetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for an unspecified indication. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 in left arm, on 02Apr2021, lot # EK5730. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Apr2021 at 21:00 the patient experienced extreme hallucinations, not feeling well, chills, aches and pains, headaches, slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, he did not get much sleep, fever. The clinical course of events was reported as follows: My son reported to me at bedtime last night, the night of his second Pfizer vaccine dose, that he was not feeling well. I told him to take some Advil and go to bed. He had a very bad night with chills and aches and pains but most distressing was his description of having had extreme hallucinations. He said that he was aware they were hallucinations and not real during and after the experience, but it was nonetheless concerning. It is also concerning that he didn&#39;t wake me for help. At any rate, he did not get much sleep and I have to assume his fever went pretty high before morning. He described to me the need to hydrate during the night. He also relayed to me this morning an experience of headaches and slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, but he is now feeling much better. He is dressed, has eaten, and is playing games on the computer. I am keeping a close eye on him today and should we return to that level of concern, we will take him to urgent care.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Still need to take it, or pain returns Stiffness- No actions can be taken to alleviate that I am aware of. Still present, but improved from yesterday and the night before Headaches- Took Ibuprofen, surprisingly ineffective . Relatively new symptom, just started today. Coughing- Did not treat, mostly disappeared by the next day. Only a very minor and sporadic cough still remains. Minor feeling of congestion- Did not treat, not serious enough to warrant action. Still present today.

The patient became pale approximately 30 seconds following the administration of the vaccine, EMT assisted the patient to the chair as he was standing up when he became pale, the patient loss consciousness for approximately 2 seconds. RN arrived at the station and assisted the patient to the ground, where he was placed in a supine position with his lower extremities elevated. The patients face mask was removed, he was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The patients color slowly returned to his face. Vitals were taken at 1540: BP: 155/70 (R arm, supine position), HR 70, RR 16, oxygen saturation at 97%, and pupils were equal. The patient had a history of fainting x 1 and his last meal was at 0800 and he stated, &#34; I didn&#39;t drink that much today.&#34; Denied any chronic medical conditions, was not currently taking any medications, and denied any drug allergies. The patient was moved to the anti-gravity chair and he was given pringles and Gatorade. Vitals were retaken at 1545: BP 162/80 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 50, RR 16, oxygen saturation at 97%. Denied any dizziness, headache, chest pain, or vision changes.  Vitals were retaken at 1553: BP 158/72 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 52, RR 16, Oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient was advised to eat a full meal prior to receiving his second COVID vaccine dose and to receive his 2nd dose in the anti-gravity chair. Vitals were retaken at 1558, BP 152/78 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 57, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient was also given a bottle of water, as he did not consume many liquids during the day. The patient&#39;s color fully returned to his face and he denied any shortness of breath, dizziness, changes in vision, or difficulty swallowing. Vitals retaken at 1603, BP 150/75 ( R arm, sitting upright), HR 60, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient called his mother to pick him up, as we strongly advised him to not operate machinery/ a vehicle after fainting. The patient&#39;s vital signs were taken at 1608, BP 140/75, HR 60, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient was advised to drink the entire bottle of water, as his blood pressure was slightly elevated and it was most likely due to being dehydrated, as he did not consume any fluid since 0800 earlier that day. The patient drank a bottle of water and his vital signs were retaken at 1614, BP 122/68 (R arm, sitting upright) and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. The patient&#39;s mother arrived on site around 1630 and spoke with RN and both EMT. RN instructed the patient about emergency precautions and to follow up with his primary care provider. RN also educated the patient about the importance of informing the healthcare provider about his history of fainting with the first vaccine, when receiving the second COVID Pfizer vaccine. Gave the patient V-safe information and reported the occurrence in VAERS. The patient had a steady and even gait when leaving the site with his mother at 1632.

                                                Patient received vaccine around 5 pm. For the first two minutes after vaccination the patient seemed to be fine. Starting around that 3rd minute the patient got very dizzy and nauseous. He was then seated to prevent further NV. I asked the patient if they were breathing ok and the patient stated his breathing was fine. After about another minute the patient&#39;s eyes got glossy and the patient seemed to be out of it. I asked multiple orienting questions such as his name, where he was, and what day of the week it is. He was only able to answer the day of the week and his head was bobbing. I then called 911 as the patient became very pale and started to profusely sweat. While on the phone with the 911 operator, the patient went completely unconscious and lost control of motor functions. I was able to confirm the patient was still breathing and still had a heart rate (although rapid) and thus compressions were not given. The EMT arrived quickly to the scene and took over care of the patient. After about 20 minutes of checking vital signs, the EMT gave the patient and his family the option on whether they want to go to the hospital or not for further examination. The family decided they wanted to take the ambulance to the hospital.

Pt. claimed it wasn&#39;t his first time after &#34;needles&#34; passing out.  Said he had a good breakfast and lunch.  He declined having his parents called.

An 18-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose intramuscularly, administered in left arm at the age of 18-year-old on 24May2021(around 1 PM) (Lot Number: ER8729) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose intramuscularly, administered in left arm at the age of 18-year-old on 03May2021(around 1 PM) (Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient hadn&#39;t taken any vaccine 4 weeks prior to the COVID 19 Vaccine. There was no family history relevant to the adverse event. Nurse stated her son had the normal flu like symptoms afterwards when he was sore and didn&#39;t feel well in May2021. A day later(in May2021) his bottom lips swelled just his bottom lips there was no oropharyngeal response on the side of the lips. He took Benadryl and about 8 to 12 hours later it went down. On Thursday(27May2021), his right hand swelled up around the size, she meant twice the size of his normal hand would be, that also lasted around 12 hours or so. Today(in May2021) he called her from work and his scrotum was swollen. And she was trying to find out if this was a normal,  she was a nurse working in an emergency department and this was not a normal response in anyone else that she had heard of who had gotten the vaccine but she wanted to call to see if this was something maybe somebody else has experienced, or one of the doctor, one of the doctor that she work with prescribed a Medrol dose pack for him just in case.  The outcome of the event &#39;bottom lips swelled was recovering, of the event right hand swelled up around the size(twice the size of his normal hand would be) was recovered in May2021, of the other events was unknown.

At that point I stayed with the patient and called for my pharmacist. The patient lost consciousness, and by the time my pharmacist got there he was stable and coherent. Once my pharmacist assessed the situation she had me call 911 for paramedics.  We had him lay on the floor with a pillow under his head, feet elevated.  We provided ice water, nuts as a snack, and I dabbed sweat from his forehead while holding an ice pack to his forehead. I stayed with the patient and patients girlfriend until paramedics arrived for transport.

                                                Allergy to red meat became prevalent again. Since becoming allergic to red meat in the summer of 2020, I had gained a tolerance to red meat to the point where I could consume as much as I wanted. This lasted between August 2020 and the date listed in this report. On that date I consumed red meat and had an allergic reaction to it. The reaction was a swelling of the fingers, hives on the arms and knees and wrist. As I didn?t have any reactions to red meat in the previous 10 months I didn?t make the connection that I was allergic to red meat again. The following Monday I consumed more red meat. That night I was very drowsy and went to bed at 1900. At around 0100 Tuesday morning I woke up with a terrible stomach ache and could feel my hands itching. I tried to go back to sleep. At around 0430 I woke up again with completely swollen hands to the point where I couldn?t bend any joint in them, hives on my wrists, knees, elbows, neck, forehead, back, and back of thighs. I went to the hospital for a severe allergic reaction. This is the exact same allergic reaction that I would have when I consumed red meat in June 2020 at the height of my allergy, but I had never had a reaction like it since then. Now I am sensitive to red meat again and I can?t think of any reason except that I received the vaccine. I have not consumed red meat since.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

I didn?t sleep well that night and during the day Thursday (01/21) I felt feverish and a throbbing headache. I tried sleeping throughout the day, still having the chills come and go. I took ibuprofen before heading the bed the next night and slept great other than feeling a little hot and sweaty. I showered the next morning and felt 100% again.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

                                                Per patient he received his second Covid vaccine 3 days prior to arrival and immediately following developed myalgias, subjective fevers and &#34; viral symptoms&#34; which she managed with ibuprofen 2 tabs q6h some improvement.  On the day prior to arrival he developed increasing shortness of breath particularly with talking and with ambulation.  He also describes chest tightness with deep inspiration, the tightness radiates to back, no radiation to left arm or jaw.  Chest tightness is non-positional, but does feel worse immediately after he lies down from ambulation and then slowly dissipates.  His last subjective fever was yesterday evening.  He has never had a reaction to the vaccine before.  He has no allergies.  No prior medical conditions he is aware of, and takes no medications.  He did not experience any of the symptoms following the first vaccine. He has h/o asymptomatic COVID infection in November 2020. Cardiology consulted for concern of pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccine. He does not have significant ST elevation or PR depression.  He also does not have evidence of significant pericardial effusion at this point.  The high sensitivity troponins are mildly elevated.  He does have viral syndrome.  Is unclear if Covid vaccination was causally related to his symptoms.  We would like to improve his medications for better chest pain control and to prevent recurrent pericarditis in the future.

He reported he had swelling of his throat  when he eats shellfish and he does have an Epi Pen at home but he doesn&#39;t carry one with him. He said Benadryl usually also helped. I told him we had Benadryl if he wanted to take a dose and he did want to receive it before leaving. I confirmed with the patient that Benadryl did not make him drowsy and that after taking 25 mg, he said he would be fine to drive and doesn&#39;t get drowsy with that medication. I did administer 25 mg of liquid diphenhydramine. His throat was feeling better before giving the dose and he also mentioned that it might have been him just getting worked up over getting the vaccine.

                                                I first experienced a headache ~20 minutes after vaccination (11:15 AM). It faded, and I  felt generally unwell and tired throughout the afternoon. Around 10:30 PM, I experienced serious chills and generally felt like I had a fever. These symptoms worsened into the night, as did the fever (measured at 102 degrees F, possibly higher at the peak). I also experienced a headache, mild nausea, joint (knee) pain, although some symptoms may have been due to dehydration. Despite being very tired, I was unable to really fall asleep. At around 6 AM the fever finally dropped substantially, and as of 8:30 AM is currently only 99.4 degrees. I am still experiencing a bit of a headache as well, but the other symptoms are gone.

The pain returned about 6 hours later and was getting more severe so he went to see his doctor. There an EKG was abnormal so he was referred to the ED where a work up showed ST elevations c/w pericarditis and an elevated trop I of 24.   The night prior, he reported a low grade temperature. He has not had any more fevers for the past 12-18 hours. He denies any other symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, cough syncope. He denies sick contacts but did have a sore throat 4-5 days ago without any other associated symptoms. He has had recent negative COVID tests while at college.

                                                My son is rarely sick. He came home from college, just after a few weeks from receiving the vaccine with a terrible cough and an unusual nosebleed. Every time he blows his nose, it is bloody. Never in 19 years have I observed this. My son is a college athlete and is extremely strong and healthy. These symptoms do not seem to be going away. The bloody nose is the most unusual effect and we are concerned this is an inflammatory side effect.

Same symptoms returned (chills, low fever, heavy sweating, tense breathing) approx. 60 hours later along with severe aching chest pain. All symptoms resolved by next morning besides chest pain, which was severe enough to warrant emergency room admission about 72 hours after vaccination. Admitted to hospital overnight with an episode of palpitations around 6pm on the first night, being given motrin and colchicine throughout stay. Pain somewhat resolved and was discharged aprox. 100 hours after vaccination. Continued use of ibuprofen and colchicine in weeks following as pain slowly resolves.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid19 vaccine on 5/9/2021. The following day developed substernal chest pain radiating to neck and left shoulder and arm.   Also reports fever of 101 degrees on 5/10/2021.  Used Tylenol, initially with some reloief, but symptoms worsened over the course of the next few days.  Then presented to ER on 5/13/21 because of worsening pain.    EKG showed diffuse ST elevations c/w pericarditis.  Initial Troponin 11.1, ultimately peaking at 13.67, c/w myopericarditis.   Admitted to hospital for supportive care, and treated with PO colchicine.   A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal LV function without segmental wall motion abnormality and no pericardial effusion.  A Cardiac CT showed normal coronary arteries.     The patient&#39;s symptoms improved with colchicine.   He was discharged home with a course of colchicine on 5/15/21.   A subsequent outpatient Cardiac MRI did show epicardial and mid wall late gadolinium enhancement involving the basal to mid lateral and inferolateral walls, and a mid wall stripe of distal anteroseptal, septal and inferoseptal segments, c/w myocarditis, idiopathic cardiomyopathy or sarcoidosis.  The pericardium was borderline thickened at 3 mm.

Patient stated that he had 2nd COVID vaccine on 4/29. He was noted to have one episode of vomiting and developed coughing. He has been c/o of sharp chest pain for the past two days. He was noted to have arm pain. He had chest pain when he breaths. He took advil and noted to have slight improvement in his pain.  He was noted to have an elevated troponin and CK. Cardiology was consulted. His initial troponin came back 4.49 with a CPK of 294.   Serial troponins were obtained. Troponin peaked to 44.8 and CPK to 1345, Echo showed newly reduced LVEF of 55%.   Diagnosed with myopericarditis possibly related to the Covid vaccine and pt was transferred to the Hospital for cardiac MRI and further work-up. Upon transfer to the hospital, cardiac MRI was performed and showed acute myocarditis with no evidence of pericardial thickening or pericarditis. It also showed left ventricular function was at the lower limits of normal with a calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and no focal wall motion abnormality. He was treated with colchicine 0.6mg, pepcid 20 mg, and ibuprofen 600mg for the myocarditis and oral morphine 15mg and tylenol 1,000mg for chest pain. He was counseled on avoiding strenuous activity for the next 3 months and following up with cardiology upon discharge.

NP went out to waiting area with cool paper towels, found pt with head on left shoulder and eyes closed.  NP tapped pt on shoulder and asked if he was ok, pt became alert immediately.  Pt&#39;s face was pale and shirt was very sweaty.  He said that this had happened a couple of times before when he has received immunizations.  Placed wet paper towels on pt&#39;s forehead and neck.  He drank some water.  He said that he was feeling better as soon as he came to.  Color was coming back into his face.  NP monitored pt directly for 15 minutes more after this. BP at this point was 100/64, pulse 72.  Color was back to pt&#39;s face, had him stand up for 2 minutes before allowing him to leave the clinic area.

                                                chest pain; Caller stated the patient had an EKG showing irregular heartbeat.; diarrhea; Myocarditis; fever; didn&#39;t feel well; warm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (Patient&#39;s Parent). A 19-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0187, NDC number and Expiration date are Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 22May2021 11:30 (at the age of 19-years-old) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of historical vaccine, bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0176, NDC number and Expiration date are Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 01May2021 10:30 (at the age of 19-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect were none. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations were none. Family medical history relevant to adverse events was none. Relevant tests were unknown. It was reported that her 19-year-old son got the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 22May2021 and 2 days later on 24May2021, he wound up with chest pain and the caller took him to emergency room and the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis and admitted to the hospital. The Reporter clarified the patient&#39;s chest pain started when he woke up around 08:30-09:00. On an unspecified date in May2021 at 23:30, the patient had a fever starting about 12 hours from receiving the second dose and it lasted for 24 hours, and the patient didn&#39;t feel well on an unspecified date in May2021. At one point he didn&#39;t want to wake his parents up around 11:30 p.m. but he was warm on an unspecified date in May2021. At 0600am the next day, the caller took the patient&#39;s temperature, and his fever was 100.9 Fahrenheit. The caller carried the patient to the emergency room on 24May2021 due to his chest pain. It was reported that patient&#39;s EKG was extremely irregular and caller stated that if it was her or her husband&#39;s EKG, they would have been having an MI, but since the patient was only 19, the doctors didn&#39;t think MI was possible. The patient was then diagnosed with myocarditis. It was reported that the patient experienced diarrhea on 24May2021. Chest Pain required a visit to Emergency Room on 24May2021 and the patient was hospitalized from 24May2021 to 26May2021. It was reported that, the patient received treatment with Colchicine 0.6 mg (NDC number and Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: 26may2022) one tablet by mouth twice a day. The patient came home from the hospital with this prescription on 26May2021 and he is still taking this medication. Prescribed to take it twice daily for a month. Famotidine, it is like a Pepcid. 20 mg (NDC number and Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: 26Mayy2021) one tablet by mouth twice a day for 6 days, because of the heavy dose of ibuprofen and diarrhea. The patient had completed this medication. Ibuprofen 600 mg (NDC number, Lot number: unknown and Expiration Date: unknown) 1 tablet by mouth three times a day for six days and this has script had ended. Caller stated that her son was recovered but that he was still taking the treatment medications at this time. Caller stated that her son&#39;s symptoms are improved, he was not complaining of chest pain anymore, she assumes his myocarditis was improved because he was not complaining of the chest pain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 100.9 Fahrenheit on an unspecified date in May2021, EKG (electrocardiogram): extremely irregular on 24May2021, PCR COVID test (sars-cov-2 test): negative on an unspecified date in May2021 while in the hospital. Caller stated the patient had an EKG showing irregular heartbeat.It was reported that the patient had tests but she didn&#39;t have results available and the patient had a PCR COVID test in the ER. Caller stated that all of this was related to the vaccine. Caller also stated that she is wondering if her son would have reacted differently if he had gotten the Moderna, but caller and her husband had gotten Pfizer and didn&#39;t have any problems. Reporter seriousness for Myocarditis, diarrhea and fever was unspecified. The outcome of the events, Myocarditis, chest pain, diarrhea and irregular heartbeat was recovering and for fever was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021 and for other events was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.  Additional information requested.

A 19-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s grandson) received BNT61B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number not reported), on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 19-year-old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetic (since 1 years old, he was diagnosed 1 week after getting the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine), dehydrated and rapid heartbeat (patient once before got dehydrated on the Hiking Trail with a rapid heartbeat). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included insulin for diabetic. The patient previously received measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine. The reporter (caller) mentioned that his grandson got the 1st dose of the vaccine on 04Mar2021. Several hours later (04Mar2021), he experienced severe dehydration and thirst and could not sleep at night. He was very very uncomfortable and usually did not complain regarding experiences. He was young and going to college and he was living on his own. He was also diabetic. She was worried about his safety regarding his intake of the 2nd dose, so she was wondering if this had been reported and for any recommendations before and after getting the 2nd dose. They were consulting with his endocrinologist and the nurse at the endocrinologist&#39;s clinic said that they recommend young diabetic people to drink tons of water when getting the vaccine. Caller mentioned that she herself got the Pfizer vaccine and had no problem with it. Caller mentioned that his Grandson was diabetic since 1 years old. He was diagnosed 1 week after getting the MMR vaccine. She also mentioned that his grandson just recently got in college and he was in the younger side of the spectrum. Caller is asking if there is any data that would include her grandson&#39;s conditions in the clinical trials. Caller stated she was calling about the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and stated her grandson who was the patient was the one who received his first dose of the vaccine on 04Mar2021 and that day he received the vaccine he told her that starting in the evening that same day (04Mar2021) she had never heard him so anxious or disturbed that he could not get relief and the adverse reaction he had was severe dehydration and thirst and it was giving him a fit. Caller stated she thinks he was probably 5&#39;10&#39;&#39; in height or so and thinks he weighed around and between 175-180 pounds when she last asked him. Caller stated she was not an HCP but was a medical technologist calling on behalf of the patient and because she was a medical technologist, she is medically trained. Caller stated she had not been able to get back in touch with the patient to get all the details for the report before she called around to get help but also stated the patient had his sleep interrupted after the vaccine was administered and he could not sleep but thinks this is all resolved and must have been resolved but she couldn&#39;t say for certain how long that he could not sleep or how long the severe dehydration or thirst lasted but she can find out. Caller stated the patient had not yet had the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and had his patient card and stated she did not have the lot, expiry date or NDC for the first dose. Caller stated for the indication for which the patient was administered the COVID vaccine, she thought because the patient was diabetic and the HCP was very anxious for him to have defense against COVID and against all various types of virus or the school may have required it but she was not sure; states it was for the patient&#39;s own safety that his endocrinologist wanted him to have the vaccine. Caller stated that the patient did not have treatment for the reported event and he did not say to her that he had any treatment; caller stated she doubted the infirmary at his school is even open at the University and she did not know whether the patient would go to the infirmary or not. Caller stated she was calling to find out of there have been any reports or feedback on this reaction that the patient had or the adverse situation the patient had several hours after receiving the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; states specifically for the severe dehydration and thirst the patient experienced after being administered the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Caller stated the patient was due to get his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine three weeks from 04Mar2021 and she was most anxious to find out what recommendations were given or if Pfizer heard complaints about other adverse events like the ones she was reporting on the patient. Caller stated the patient once before got dehydrated on the Hiking Trail with a rapid heartbeat and he was with his father at that time; no further details provided by the caller. Caller stated the patient reported this to her in conversation a day or so after he had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and she is medically trained and it has been a long time since she used that medical training but the patient is diabetic since the age of 1 and he had good care and has been under the care of the hospital endocrinologist and his HCP since he was found to have diabetes and he uses his insulin pump very well. Caller stated the patient was off to college where very few were attending college and the patient had a very undesirable evening after the vaccine of lack of sleep and he was so thirsty and could not get hydrated and she knows dehydration is bad for anybody even if they aren&#39;t diabetic or if they have a life threatening type of illness but the patient was at school and did not have a family member to help take care of him and he was due for his 2nd shot three weeks from 04Mar2021. Caller stated she was trying to find out the best route for him to go report this and she told him to report the reaction to the HCP and to call the HCP who prescribed the vaccine; stated the patient&#39;s endocrinologist was not able to get in touch with the patient and he was not answering the phone; stated the patient is at college and he was on online courses. Caller stated she was very anxious to find out enough information about this and it is a concern to his treating physician and she was asking about recommendations about the patient not having his 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; stated she spoke with the nurse that works with the endocrinologist for all of these 18 years they have cared for the patient. Caller states the HCP&#39;s nurse stated she had found that patients that receive the vaccine and have diabetes and are treated at the hospital they recommend that those patients drink tons and tons of water before having the vaccine because some types of people with diabetes have extreme thirst.  Caller stated she had no vaccine names, patient information or lot number or other information to provide on the patients that had the vaccine and have diabetes. Caller stated she spoke at the HCP office and stated there was no need for secrecy and HIPPA was not in Pfizer&#39;s domain; stated she cannot depend on the patient to look out for his own safety and she as a medical technologist used to give patients ordered glucose tolerance tests and she knew of the reactions that occurred with those patients and she did not want the patient to be stuck and wanted for him to do the smart thing of spending the night at home rather than drive back. Caller stated for those patients she administered glucose tests to she had no patient information or lot numbers or other information to provide and it was years ago before the Pfizer COVID vaccine came out. Caller stated she worked trying to get patient&#39;s diabetes under control at the University where she worked. Caller stated she already called and waited for organization but did not speak to anyone and left them a number to call her back a couple of days ago but she had not heard back; stated there were 18 people in the phone queue before her and she was hoping not to have to wait again. Caller stated her grandson probably does not had the time to wait on the phone being at college and he needed to do what he needed to do to be safe. Caller stated she had only spoken with the endocrinologist who treats the patient in his hometown and reported this information to the HCP&#39;s nurse and they are pretty good with follow up with patients. Caller stated she did not think the patient had other health issues and he actually had done extremely well on his insulin pump and had been on the insulin pump since about 3 years of age; stated she had no name of the insulin, had no lot numbers or further information. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The vaccine was administered to the writer at 0800 on 1/5/2021. No immediate reactions were noticed for the 30 minutes observation period immediately after. The writer&#39;s muscle that received the vaccine began to become increasingly sore throughout the day; however, that was similar to the first dose of the same vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain was described as constant (2/10) but aggravated with motion. The pain did interfere with the writer&#39;s normal range of motion (specifically raising the writer&#39;s arm above shoulder height). From 0800-2200 on 1/5/2021 no noticeable symptoms except for the injection site pain occurred.   At 2200, the writer rapidly developed chills, body aches, a headache, fatigue, and a fever of 100.8. These symptoms were left untreated and continued through the night (the symptoms did not interfere with sleep). The writer woke up at 1300 on 1/6/2021; all previous symptoms had resolved by this time except for the injection site pain. By 1400 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed pain near the right axillary lymph nodes. The pain can be described as moderate (1/10) and generally occurred only with motion. The writer was unable to palpate any swelling in the area. Around 1800 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed it felt weird to swallow. Specifically, it felt as if there was a slight internal swelling 1-inch subhyoidally and 1-2 inches laterally within the right side of his neck when he swallowed. The swelling was not palpable from the skin&#39;s surface. The writer did not seek medical attention as breathing/eating/drinking were not made more difficult but monitored this closely. The swelling in the neck resolved by 2000 on 1/6/2021. The lymph node pain in the right arm resolved over the course of a few days and was no longer present by 1/9/2021 at 1300.

                                                Side effects manifested after second dose as a migrane in the early morning (~4:30 AM). Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

These spasms lasted until roughly 8am and were strong enough to rattle my 300lb bed frame. The only treatment I could think of at the time was to get as warm as I could so i covered myself in 8 blankets and just waited it out. It is now noon and the chills/spasms seem to be gone.

I made the decision to turn around as I felt my throat was beginning to close. I got back to Medical Center around 2:35, where I was monitored until 4:15. I was giving Benadryl and water when I arrived and they took my vital signs. There was one RN monitoring me there entire time, keeping conversation with me, and checking my vitals every 15 minutes. Then around 4:15 a physician said I was okay to leave.

Couldn&#39;t find his vaccine card, so called him with Lot # and expiration of dose.  Advised to call us back after being seen to update his condition.

Patient was watched from 3pm (right after dose) to  3:30pm. He was feeling these symptoms from 3pm to about 3:15pm. He was given water after 5 minutes and cold wash rags to put on his forehead and neck. He was also told to breath deep breaths slowly. He said his throat felt sore and was provided with a throat lozenge. Color in his face returned after roughly 10 to 15 minutes and he verbally said he was feeling much better. Pharmacy associates watched him for another 15 minutes to make sure he was okay.

He waived at us and sat down. We asked if he was ok and he waived again stating he didn&#39;t feel well. He sat back down and we proceeded to check on him. As we were coming to check on him, he fainted and fell face forward on to the floor. We called 911 and rolled him gently to his back. He had a laceration  above his eye from the fall. EMT came and assessed the patient. After observation, he was allowed to be picked up from his friend and taken to a clinic for stitches.

I had COVID-19 in late January 2021, and these symptoms from the vaccine felt about the same as the COVID symptoms I had, they just didn&#39;t last as long. However, around 36 hours after I received my vaccine, my armpit area started to become sore. It has felt swollen and sore for the past 36-48 hours. I also developed a fever of around 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit today, so around 72 hours after I received the vaccine. I have also been fatigued for the past 3 days.

The patient had no Known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no COVID tested post vaccination. The patient had not received other vaccine in four weeks. On 15Apr2021 04:00, his body was involuntarily twitching and his teeth was opening and closing as if he was having a seizure. He thought it was because he was cold so he put on 3 layers of clothes and 2 bundles of blankets and turned the heat up, but his body was still shaking and he was still cold. He tried to go back to sleep to see if that would fix it, but it did not until he went to work and around 7:30 a.m., the shivering stopped, but the headaches persisted and he had to ask to go home and he received an occurrence because he did not have a doctor&#39;s note. He clocked out at 8 and he went to sleep for an hour in the car in the parking lot because he was in no condition to drive home. Treatment received for the events included Acetaminophen and rest. The outcome of teeth was opening and closing as if I was having a seizure, body was involuntarily twitching, was cold, shaking, was resolving. The outcome of shivering was resolved. The outcome of headaches was not resolved.

Not feeling any other side effects internet sources said that this was rare enough to report. I did some weight lifting the day before I noticed this.

                                                Approximately three to four minutes after the second dose, he reported feeling dizzy. A few seconds later he lost consciousness with eyes rolled to the back of his head. He was unresponsive to verbal communication or attempts to shake him awake. He then began grunting and struggling for breath. His body began to shake/convulse and he lost control of his bladder. This lasted about five to ten seconds. He regained consciousness and reported that he felt as if he was &#34;dreaming&#34;. He also reported feeling very hot, and had sweat dripping down his face. Paramedics were called to the scene where his vital signs were checked. All signs including temperature were normal. His first dose on /26/21 had an almost exact reaction, minus losing control of bladder, although that time nobody was around to assist him.

He was found to have markedly elevated troponins without EKG changes.  He was admitted to the hospital for evaluation and monitoring where cardiac MRI showed myocardial infllammation consistent with myocarditis. There was no other apparent cause based on patient&#39;s history.  He was found to have a reduced ejection fraction on echocardiogram as a result of his myocarditis.  He continued to have dyspnea on exertion at discharge.

A 20-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0151), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 15Apr2021, as second dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and allergies to tree nuts and penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate (FLOVENT), salbutamol sulfate (ALBUTEROL), and an unspecified multivitamin. The patient previously took montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) and bacitracin/ neomycin sulfate/ polymyxin B sulfate (TRIPLE ANTIBIOTIC Ointment) and experienced allergies to both; and the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ER8727) on 19Mar2021 at the age of 20 years for COVID-19 immunization (right arm). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. On 15Apr2021, the patient experienced initial anxiety or panic after shot was given. On 16Apr2021 (next day), the patient had fever and fatigue. The second day after (17Apr2021), the patient had shortness of breath and chest tightness. After several trips to the emergency room, the primary care physician (PCP) did laboratory tests that diagnosed an overactive thyroid (17Apr2021). Symptoms still remain and are being treated by an endocrinologist. Treatments included methimazole, lorazepam (ATIVAN), and diltiazem. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office or clinic visit and emergency room or department or urgent care. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient had not recovered from the events.

Prior to vomiting, school staff reported that he seemed unwell (pt. is severely disabled and has very limited speech).  The first episode of vomiting was followed by multiple (4-5) episodes of vomiting blood.  School staff including the school nurse report observing clots in the blood, bright red blood, and brown coffee ground type blood in the vomit.  The school staff called 911 and pt. was transported to Hospital.  In the ambulance pt. vomited again and the paramedic reported observing blood in the vomit. Pt. was observed in the ER and given Zofran and liquids.  Blood tests and a CT scan with and without contrast were performed.  Neither tests explained the bloody vomiting. Pt has since stopped vomiting and is resting quietly at home and eating normally.  The hospital referred Noah to a Gastroenterologist for follow up.

                                                Patient developed pleuritic chest pain.  Presented to ER and had CT angiogram to eval for pulmonary embolism.  Unfortunately, study was suboptimal but showed possible subsegmental PE vs mixing defect and consolidation in lingula consistent with pneumonia vs pulmonary infarct from PE.  Scan initially read as more likely pneumonia but patient without consistent symptoms and re-read as concerning for pulmonary embolism.  Patient otherwise healthy without other risk factors for PE.  Repeat CTA 2 weeks later with better quality without e/o PE and improving but not resolved opacity in lingula.  LE dopplers 3 wks after onset w/o DVT.  Hypercoaguable labs pending.

A 20-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 13May2021 at 11:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient is very strict on his health. The patient is a vegetarian, he is very health conscious. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on Apr2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced tenderness at the shot site and was very tired. On the morning of 14May2021, the patient had a small temperature that was one degree higher than before and the patient was wiped out tired-extremely exhausted and tired. Then the patient started experiencing chest pain within days of the second dose. The patient woke up on 15May2021 with chest pain that was persistent through 18May2021. On 19May2021, the chest pain got worse. The reporter thought the patient had indigestion so she gave the patient Tylenol, Pepcid, and clear soda and the patient felt a little better. On 20May2021, the patient was clutching his chest and had pain in his left arm. The patient couldn&#39;t talk, the pain was so hard. The patient went to the emergency room at 12:00 and the healthcare team said that the patient was experiencing a heart attack (reported time of heart attack was 10:00). The patient was not admitted to the hospital. They said the chemical that the large muscle in the heart makes, it was elevated which was how they determined it was a heart attack. These lab numbers were drawn every three hours and they came down but never went away. The patient had two Troponin draws and they were both elevated. They also did an EKG on the patient which showed a heart attack. The patient was told to see a cardiologist and was sent home. The reporter is watching the patient and the patient is still in a little bit of pain but not as much. The patient went to his primary care provider on the day of the report and the doctor doesn&#39;t see this as a displaced issue. The doctor does not know what would cause this in the heart. The patient is to see the cardiologist on Tuesday, 25May2021. The reporter is unsure if this is related to the vaccine but it was almost a week after the patient&#39;s second dose. The outcome of the event small temperature that was one degree higher than before was recovering and the outcome of the event wiped out tired-extremely exhausted and tired was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested

At approximately 3:10pm, I heard a loud bang and peeked my head out of the pharmacy and saw that there was a young man on the floor. He fell into the endcap. I immediately ran out to the customer. Upon talking to him, he did not pass out or hit his head but did severely scratch the left side of his cheek to his neck above is collar bone.  I checked his blood pressure and it was 119/79. He initially said he felt very hot and was sweaty, then we gave the patient orange juice as he stated he hadn&#39;t had much to eat, and felt better after drinking the juice. He denied EMS and called his grandmother to come pick him up.

It worsened over time as I was working the night shift and using the arm. Nearing midnight that same day, I started feeling feverish, and when I got home at 1:15am I got some water and tried to sleep, but it&#39;s 6 hours later and I haven&#39;t been able to sleep at all.

This The reporter reported for a 20-year-old male patient (Reporter&#39;s son) via medical information team.  A 20-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 (20-year-old at the time of vaccination) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included illness from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. He has been to the doctor for sick visits 20 times in 20 years. The reporter also stated that there are no mental health issues noted in their family history. The reporter also stated that the patient was overall healthy with no significant medical history in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter reported that patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on Saturday and by Monday was having flu like symptoms, fevers, chills, diarrhoea, chest pain, shakiness, as well as other neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. He has been to the doctor for sick visits 20 times in 20 years. After receiving the COVID 19 vaccines, the patient has been seen by the doctor 3 times in one week. The patient&#39;s side effects have lasted 3-4 weeks. The reporter would like to know commonly reported side effects of the vaccine and their duration. The reporter would like to know the efficacy of only one dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine as the patient was hesitant to get the 2nd dose due to the side effects noted from the 1st vaccine. The reporter was advised per &#34;attached&#34; dose for efficacy after one dose. The reporter was not satisfied with this data and wanted to know more about what she had been read about online. The reporter was advised caller agent as could do some more research and contact her back with possible additional data which caller agreed to doing. Upon call back on 14Jun2021, advised caller per (website &#34;PRIVACY&#34;) from 10Dec2020. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients began to diverge by 12 days after the first dose, and 52.4% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval: 29.5, 68.4) was observed between dose 1 and dose 2, indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization. Two doses of vaccine provide the maximum protection observed. Ten cases of severe COVID-19 were observed with onset after the first dose. Nine cases occurred among placebo recipients and one among BNT162b2 recipients. The reporter would like to know dosing interval between shot one and two. Patient had their 1st dose on 14May2021 and has not received the 2nd dose yet due to side effects from what they felt was caused by the 1st dose of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. The reporter received response as &#34;you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine if you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if you had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision&#34;. The reporter wanted to know should the patient get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine after the reported side effects of flu like symptoms, fevers, chills, diarrhoea, chest pain, shakiness, as well as other neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. The reporter received response as do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of the events was resolved in 2021  Follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number has been requested

Day 3 he felt better but had some arm cramping. 84 hours after the vaccine he woke with tremors for several hours overnight; he then continue to experience muscle twitching but the tremor resolved the next morning. That day he noticed he felt very fatigued. The twitching and spasms lasted about 3 or 4 days. The legs will still spasm at nighttime and he still feels fatigued with less exercise tolerance. His baseline was 2-3 miles walking without difficulty prior to the vaccine, lately a mile will wipe him out. He also noticed intermittent midline pain around his breastbone that has improved. He hasn&#39;t had any shortness of breath. He had poor circulation to his hands and were cold and white but that resolved. He did not have sensory changes. His symptoms overall have been improving.

                                                Symptoms started during bedtime and woke me up. Began with severe full body chills and full body muscle shaking and weakness during the night of 1/5 and early morning of 1/6, around 1000 to 0200. Slight headache began during that time as well.   Upon waking at 0900 on 1/6, chills and shaking decreased to mild severity, muscles still felt moderately weak and shaky, headache had increased in severity to a severe throbbing pain that worsened upon standing and walking, and moderate visual photosensitivity began. The headache persisted until I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen 200 mg, which is when the severity decreased to moderate after a few hours and then mild by bedtime. The photosensitivity persisted through the day and did not decrease much by bedtime.   Upon waking 1/7, there was only a mild headache and mild photosensitivity that faded completely within a few hours, no medication required. No more symptoms in the afternoon.

                                                ED Visit 3/11/21 History of Present Illness 21 year old man pmhx of autism, recurrent abscesses, presents with complaint of L axilla swelling and drainage. Pt received COVID vaccine in L arm on 3/1. Pt did well until 3/5 when he started to complain of pain in the L armpit. Mother examined the area and did not see anything concerning. The pain continued through the weekend, no fevers. Pt felt warm on Monday, no temperature taken. Mother then noted a few &#34;bump&#34; near the L armpit. The bumps continued to swell and be painful on Tuesday, went to pediatrician and was prescribed Keflex. Pt has been taking Keflex but continues to spike fevers, Tmax 102F on Wednesday. Pt had fevers yesterday and today of &#34;about 100.&#34; Pt took a nap today, and woke up with the area draining. Mother states that the drainage was smelly pus. Called PCP who recommended evaluation. ED course: Patient observed in the emergency department of antipyretics and did not have any further fever.  I will switch his treatment to clindamycin and provide topical bacitracin and provide strict criteria to come back if pt became febrile instructions provided to mom.   Patient safe for discharge to home. Discharged in improved condition. Written instructions reviewed with family.  3/18/2021 Discharge Summary History of Present Illness 21yo man with h/o autism and multiple soft tissue infections including cellulitis and pilonidal cyst who presented to the ED 3/13/2021 after axillary drainage and fever.  He had been treated outpatient with keflex, but continued to have fevers at home. Re-evaluated at ED and placed on clindamycin. Cultures from outpatient showing skin flora. Mother has been doing several dressings of drainage at home and ongoing fevers up to 102 so was brought to the ED for evaluation. No cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, recent travel, known sick contacts.  Summary of hospitalization: He re-presented to ED on 3/13/2021 and was started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. A CT scan with contrast done to determine extension of abscess, which was fortunately limited to the subcutaneous plane (no infiltration near bone or into muscle fascia). In the ED, patient&#39;s creatinine was 1.5. Patient received IVF and his creatinine downtrended to 0.75 on 3/18/21.   The surgical course was uneventful. Successful debridement of the left axillary abscess was performed on 03/4/21. Wound cultures grew Actinomyces Europaeus and S. Epidermidis and Infectious Disease was consulted. Their antibiotic recommendations to discontinue the cefepime/flagyl and start vanc/CTX were followed. Sensitivity analyses showed S. Epidermidis was sensitive to linezolid, tetracyclin, tigecyclin, bactruim and vancomycin. The Actinomyces Europaeus sensitivities have not yet resulted at time of discharge. Per ID recommendations, the vanc and CTX were discontinued and oral doxycycline was started, which should be continued for 6 months. It could be considered to switch to PO amoxicillin after 2 weeks and finish the 6 month course with amoxicillin. This will be discussed during outpatient follow-up. Per ID recommendations, the following labs should be checked 2 weeks after discharge (on 3/29/21) and could be spaced out to every 4 weeks thereafter if normal: CBC with differential, CRP, ESR, BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT.  The patient is scheduled to see (ID) on 5/5/21. Dermatology was consulted per ID recs for evaluation of spots on the chest and back. Per dermatology these spots are keloid, not suspicious for hidradenitis suppurative, there is no need for biopsy. For pilonidal cyst spot dermatology recommends rec hibicleans cream. Immunology was consulted for recurring abscesses and recommended the following tests, which were ordered, in addition to outpatient followup: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, specific Ab titers: for strep pneumo IgG (23 serotypes) and tetanus IgG, lymphocyte subsets, T cell memory panel, B cell memory panel, neutrophil DHR, CH50.  A wound VAC was placed on the left axillary wound bed on 03/15/21 and exchanged on 3/17/21.  Patient tolerated the wound vac changes well with 5mg of oxycodone taken 1 hour prior to the vac change. On 03/18/21 patient was discharged with a home wound vac and VNA.  At the time of discharged patient was afebrile, his pain was well controlled, his oxygen saturations were &gt;94% on room air, he was tolerating a regular diet and voiding/stooling without issues.

Symptoms almost completely resolved after that period, occasionally had some very mild joint pain still.*Note after both doses, pain in left arm was more severe than right arm* Starting the night of Jan 22 (fri) started having light leg pain, which carried into the 22nd. Dismissed it as too much walking the next day.Jan 24: leg pain a bit more severe, from a 1-2 to a 2-3. Included joint pain in left knee and ankle. Jan 25: pain in both legs at a 3-4, also mild pain in left arm (1-2) as well as joint pain. Jan 26: pain in left arm more severe, leg pain similar in severe. Very mild pain in right arm starting that evening, though only in upper arm. No joint pain in right arm Jan 27: pain in left arm similar in severity, slight increase in right arm pain, would rate 2-3 in right arm, 3-4 in left arm, 3-4 in legs. Muscle weakness in legs (legs shaking when walking down stairs for example) Jan 28 (Thurs):Symptoms started fading. Arm pain lowered in severity in both arms, as did leg pain. By Saturday all that remained was mild leg pain (1-2 in severity)Since then, leg pain has persisted.  Week of Feb 14, leg pain increased in severity back to a 3-4. Visited the doctor on the 17th and had blood-work done on the 23rd after severity didn&#39;t decrease. Blood-work was normal other than slightly elevated lymphocyte % (50.8%)Visited a specialty medicine doctor on 2/25 and had x-rays done of legs. Results normal. Thought to have developed Achilles tendinitis. Possibly attributed to inflammation in legs, doctor wasn&#39;t sure. Rough quote &#34;could it be from the vaccine, possibly, we just don&#39;t know.&#34; Have been doing stretches since which has helped the leg pain. Starting on March 12, I began to have pain in my left arm again, and ended up getting vertigo that evening. The arm pain persisted on and off from then on out, as well as occasional dizziness, which I treated with Dramamine. I did get an appointment scheduled with a neurologist in May that I still have. On March 25, I began to feel unwell, with a fever, dizziness, and a headache. That worsened into the evening, and I woke up at around 3 am with a high fever, that ended up going to about 103 F, and began vomiting around 4:30am on Friday, which persisted into the evening. On Saturday evening I began to feel better. With that recovery, the constant leg pain and frequent arm pain seemed to be gone, and has yet to return to the degree that it had been prior to that bout of sickness.  I do still occasionally get arm or leg pain, but it&#39;s minor and only lasts about 20-30 minutes at a time.

Since he was feeling light-headed, the immunizing pharmacist told me to get the blood pressure cuff. When I got back, the patient passed out. The pharmacist and I moved the chair from underneath him and he gently put him on the floor. He quickly woke up and the pharmacist began to ask him questions such as his name and where he was to make sure he was ok. He was able to answer those questions fine and we placed him in a chair so he can rest. When he was in the chair, he began to pass out again. He quickly woke up again but wasn&#39;t feeling good. The pharmacist checked his blood pressure and it was low. His temperature was at 93F. The pharmacist continued to stay with him and he made sure that someone else was able to come and pick him up. Once he felt ok, he had the patient go sit in the post-vaccination waiting area until he had his ride pick him up.

                                                I have already had COVID.  My symptoms, at the time of infection, were confusion due to brain inflammation, and nasal drip. It was very mild and easy to get over. No taste and smell as well, still at the time of writing. After the first vaccination, it made me bedridden for a whole day. No fevers or brain inflammation. It felt worse than COVID. The second vaccination caused an even more extreme immune response. Around 2 PM, I ended up feeling extremely fatigued and feverish. I had not developed a fever while infected with COVID, nor after the first vaccine. An hour later, I started getting extremely confused, and my head wouldn?t stop pounding. It was the exact same feeling of brain inflammation present when I was infected. I do not recollect how long I was in a completely disassociative state, but it is probably around 2 hours. I could not move to call 911. I should have been in an emergency room, but unfortunately I was alone. After that, I have had 101F fevers, fatigue, and aches.

                                                started with soreness/stiffness in injection site, which I expected as it was how I reacted with the first shot.  however, I then started experiencing mild dizziness/visual impairment (feeling like my vision was shifting or &#34;glitching&#34;) that started around two hours after the shot, slow onset of sore/achy back muscles that hit peak pain at around 3am, and intense chills/shivers that started around 11pm, getting progressively worse as the night went on. Attempted to stop the chills by wrapping in several blankets, but only continued to feel colder and colder. Despite the chills starting around 11pm, fever did not present itself until around 1am, hitting 99.8°F by 1:30am. It was around this time that I took an ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which did not kick in until around 2:30am. Once the chills stopped, my hands and feet only got hotter, keeping me awake for an additional 2 1/2 hours.

                                                21yoM states that on 25 March 2021, he noted 25 minutes after his 1st dose of Pfizer vaccines, he noted a throat tightness, feels tight, scratchy, noted a hoarse throat with some voice changes. He felt throat tightness made it hard to breath, he had associated lightheadedness, felt anxious, almost like a wheezing sound when breathed in and out in his upper neck. When he stood up, he did feel like he needed to hold onto something to steady himself, had some tunnel vision, improved with sitting down and closing his yes and taking deep breaths. He felt warm at the time, not cold or clammy. His friend said he looked ghostly white, no flushing, no hives, no angioedema. No sense of impending doom. He did take Zyrtec the day that he received the vaccine.   He waited the 15 minutes after vaccine without symptoms, and had walked back to class by the time it started. Between the vaccine and symptoms onset, he denies eating anything, being stung by anything.   He told a friend about his symptoms, and he returned to the hospital via base taxi arrived at ER. Symptoms were still occurring about 60 minutes after vaccination when he arrived at the ER. In the ER, he underwent exam, was given oral Benadryl.  His symptoms of scratchy throat lasted for 2 days afterwards with some associated fatigue, post-nasal drip.  He denies other symptoms. No fevers or chills. Small amount of pain and a ?knot? at the injection site the next day, but minimal according to the paitent.   Denies hives, angioedema, SOB, wheezing, nausea/vomiting, no diarrhea, abdominal pain, nasal pruritus/congestion, ocuarl itching/redness, no syncope.   No h/o vaccine reactions before. No h/o passing out before at all, specifically not to needles, blood draws, or vaccines before.   No h/o venom or drug allergy. He does report a history of apple allergic reaction 1 year previous when eating a raw apple, felt his throat close within 15-30 minutes, no hives or other systemic symptoms. He took oral Benadryl and went to ER. He was given oral Benadryl, no Epipen. He followed up with his PCM regarding possible apple allergy and was told to avoid apples, but was never tested for apple allergy. Since then, when he drinks apple juice, his throat will start hurting, but otherwise, he has avoided raw and cooked allergies. He does report seasonal rhinitis symptoms that are worse in the fall. He takes allegra as needed to treat these symptoms. He is not carrying an Epipen currently

                                                Overnight after shot just typical symptoms, some slight chills and next day just a little tired Day 2 after shot, April 11th.  Chest pain, squeezing in chest. Unusual but manageable and didn?t feel terrible otherwise,maybe slightly tired.  Tried leaning forward to make feel better.  Day 3 and 4 chest pain/heart squeezing continued and was bothersome and, went to Urgent Care this day  April 13th. EKG was a little abnormal and told to follow up with a cardiologist and take Advil.  The heart squeezing feeling continued.  Early morning hours April 14th very sick, excessive shaking (no fever), extreme nausea, faint feeling, dry cough (laying on bathroom floor).  Not much, if any chest pain at the time.  Went to ER.  Not much chest pain during ER visit but nauseous and shaking etc. Test were run.   Told that the symptoms were a delayed reaction to the vaccine and to follow up with a cardiologist because possible abnormal EKG and to take Advil as needed.  Overnight at home, no chest pain but an hour of the shaking and nausea returned but not as bad as before.  Over next couple days the chest pain/squeezing, slightly shakes and  light headedness would come and go and by 4-16 feeling pretty great.  The heart feeling mildly at most in the background but not debilitating.  Starting week of April 20th maybe 4-5 flare ups with chest pain and no pattern but not debilitating.  Could happen at rest.  April 27th bigger flare up more debilitating, had to lie down, heart squeezing  pain and maybe some wheezing when breathed in but not tightness in throat.  Lasted about 30 minutes.  Was just doing schoolwork with friends at the time so not under any physical or emotional stress at the time.  After this from April 20 to May 3rd feeling heart symptom mildly but not debilitating and could resume normal active life.  Had cardiology appt. May 3rd with nurse practitioner.  According to NP the 12 Lead EKG run that day correlated with abnormal EKG from ER.  Normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia Rightward axis Pulmonary disease pattern.  Incomplete right bundle branch block Abnormal ECG.  Given 4 lead heart monitor to wear for a week.  Also ordered a CV CT angiogram coronaries with calcium scoring.  The test could not be scheduled through them until July.  Also told could go on hiking trip out west and to stop and rest if felt pain.  For parents reassurance about hiking trip, had a second opinion over teleconference call with Dr., myocarditis specialist to confirm would be safe on hiking trip. Dr. said he should be good to go.  He said these heart symptoms related to the second vaccine could fade over time.  Hiking trip May 20th to May 30th.  Did fine with exertion and just a few small episodes of the chest pain, light headedness and maybe a little shaking but these were at rest.  Also, 4 lead heart monitor report was good.  Returned from trip May 30th and no chest pain or symptoms for approximately 3 weeks through June 17th.   June 18th went to urgent care for sore throat and ear.  Prescribed amoxycillin.  Took the amoxycillin and one Advil sinus, that evening had a heart squeezing episode return.  This was the first time in almost 3 weeks.  Did not take any more Advil sinus in case that caused the episode. Had another slight episode that evening.  Hiked next day June 19th and fine.  Then felt it slightly again after eating that afternoon of the 19th, also chest did feel a little tight all day.  Then felt it again that evening.  Still taking Amoxycillin as of today.

I took some Tylenol in hopes it would help but it got worse throughout the night. During the night, I couldn?t hardly sleep due to feeling really hot and achy. I felt like I had a fever but did not have a thermometer to check it. When I woke up this morning, I noticed I had a knot on my clavicle which I believe it to be a swollen supraclavicular lymph node. I was unable to go to my internship today due to feeling ill but I am feeling better now after sleep and medication.

A 22-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot: EK5730) intramuscularly in left arm on 21Dec2020 (15:00-16:00) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received first dose of vaccine 21Dec2020 and SARS-Cov-2 positive 06Jan2021 13:00. The patient got COVID vaccine 21Dec2020, and was scheduled to get second dose on 11Jan2021. He had a sniffle the other day on 05Jan2021 night time and tested positive for COVID on 06Jan2021, so reporter wanted to know if he should still get second dose. His symptoms are stable. He is quarantining. He is on his way to do a PCR now. Reporter read somewhere people could have false positive in nasal. He is losing some taste from 07Jan2021 (01:00 - 02:00). Most things he can taste. Some he cannot. It is not completely gone but reduced by 30-40%. He did a mouthwash with a sting and is not feeling that sting anymore. He said last night, same thing. He did a mouth wash and did not really taste much. It is not as prevalent as it was before. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test: positive on 06Jan2021, positive COVID test 06Jan2021, 13:00, Nasal swab COVID. Event outcome of sniffles was recovering, while for other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The efficacy of a drug varies from one patient to another and can be affected by different factors; however, a contributory role of the suspect drug BNT162B2 to the reported event ___ cannot be ruled out.

When the pharmacist went to release him, he was pale, dizzy, and clammy. He stated that he did not feel good. The pharmacist fanned him to cool  him down. She also gave him a wet rag to wipe his forehead. He was given two teaspoonful of Benadryl 12.5mg/ 5ml. The patient stated that he was feeling dizzy and thought he was going to faint. The pharmacy called 911. The patient removed his jacket and mask as he was hot. The EMT arrived and walked him outside* I am not sure what happened after that

                                                Around 10pm, I was suddenly very tired and could not stop yawning. I typically am up until 12-1 most nights so this was out of the ordinary. While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

I went to check in on him at 10:50a at which point he was eating a candy bar and stated he was already feeling better. He stated he has experienced symptoms of low blood sugar before and this was similar to what he had experienced in the past - even though it was worse. He said he was already feeling better, but he wanted to get something else to eat. I told him to stay put till 11a to make sure he wasn&#39;t still dizzy. At 11a, he was still feeling better and we went to grab him a pack of barbecue chips. He stayed till 11:20a and was still doing ok and left. I called him at 1:30p and has still doing ok.

Stated he never had a reaction to vaccination before, but has fainted before from blood pressure being taken. Shortly after vaccination he asked to lie down and then he fainted. He quickly regained consciousness and was sweating but talknig and alert. RPH administering the vaccine lowerd him to the floor with no impact. 911 was called and patient was alert and monitored for 30 minutes. He declined further treatment.

                                                Felt fine day of vaccine, Sunday, just minor arm pain. Woke up the next morning with pretty severe fatigue and more arm pain. Around 11am I had pretty bad chills that lasted about an hour, along with minor nausea. Additionally,  throughout most of the day my heart rate was usually between 90-100 bpm, even while lying down and doing nothing.  Going to sleep on Monday night I woke around 3 times during the night with cold sweats. Waking up on Tuesday morning, my heart rate is still elevated, arm is still sore, but the fatigue isn&#39;t as bad. However, at around 9am on Tuesday morning I started to develop itchy hives and a rash on the back of my legs.  After the first dose I only had a sore arm, no symptoms like these, and I do not have any known allergies.

I have gone 25 times from Friday am-sat night. It calmed on Sunday and picked up Monday and this morning. I have been following the BRAT diet and have been drinking fluids. It doesn?t make sense why I?m still feeling this way. I also had a fever for three days,  throwing up Friday/Saturday, and have had headaches since Friday.

A 22-years-old male patient (Son) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. My son is having a tough time with the vaccine. Everyday he has a couple of side effects. He started with body ache and tiredness on unspecified date Apr2021. He had a pounding headache. His headache was moderate today. However, the headache symptoms are getting worst. Generally, the symptoms last a day his have been getting worst for 7 days. He has been taking Tylenol and Advil. But the Advil doesn&#39;t even seem to hep anymore.&#34; headache is a common side effect reported with the vaccine. If the symptoms persists or get worst please consult your HCP. Please note blood clot has not been associated with the vaccine. Patient is been experiencing what I considered to be pretty severe, I guess reaction in term of aches and headache. This morning he woke up with the pounding headache, he kid described it as pounding and I just I guess I want to ask because everywhere I read, it says mild headaches are common and aches and I understand that but I guess understanding why this, this is considered somewhat as severe reaction or is there anything he can do to alleviate the symptom and should he, I guess my question is actually I guess my question also is should he not possibly get the second dose if he is experiencing such bad headaches with the first dose. When paraphrased the concern, reporter stated, Yes, basically we are thinking if can do to alleviate it and then he could not get the second dose, if you have any advice, I guess and just let you know he went to his health center in the college he went to get a COVID test and a flu test just to make sure he doesn&#39;t have actual Covid or flu and those report I got yesterday and so they told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. When probed for event start date, reporter stated, I would say a day after, I would say 09Apr2021, I guess it&#39;s phantom (not clarified) with symptom, the first day he was just tired, as far as the headache that started on the 09Apr2021. He (son) also passed out after the vaccine, which I also did that I didn&#39;t have Pfizer I (reporter) had Moderna and I had that same reaction, so I think that sometimes happens to some people but that&#39;s it happens also. When probed for vaccination anatomical site, reporter stated, Outside of the body I guess, I don&#39;t know that for sure. Patient still having the problem (event), and out event outcome, reporter stated, Yes, I think persisting, I think it varies. Patient has been taking Advil (Ibuprofen) and Tylenol (treatment). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included influenza virus test: negative on 12Apr2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 12Apr2021. They told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of body ache (pain), tiredness (fatigue), pounding headache/headache symptoms are getting worst (headache). The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  QR Comment: Call handler not filed split case. Might have been split case.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

He felt perfectly fine except now with a headache which started this morning, probably around maybe 07:30. Outcome of the event headache was not recovered and for all other events, it was recovered on 15Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Pt reported reaction with #1 dose of mild SOB and itchy throat. Given PO Benadryl and brought to ED for his SOB, though no additional treatments administered. Both ED Physician and PCP advised pt should still receive #2 dose. Pt presented prior to dose with normal mentation, and no difficulty ambulating or verbalizing beyond baseline. Pt had no issues when receiving vaccine then called over staff 2-3 minutes after vaccination to report SOB. EMS notified and staff. EMT and staff. EMR came to assist patient. Clinical Lead notified of 1st dose reaction and current reaction after SOB onset began and EMS brought over. Pt provided PO Benadryl 5 minutes after vaccine administered and able to swallow with no issue. I, Clinical Lead, remained at patient side where patient was able to describe his pain but had dyspnea and only able to get out 2-3 words at a time. After a few minutes, pt SOB worsened to the point he was unable to speak but no color changes noted. Mentation declined with pt somnolence present. At this point, Clinical Lead called 911 for backup as Benadryl had no relief of symptoms and SOB worsened along with mentation. Also noted that EMS pulse ox was not working so unable to provide accurate O2 saturation to delineate whether reaction was anxiety or allergic. Pt also noted history of seizure disorder though declined feeling was a current seizure and denied history of respiratory or cardiac conditions. Paramedics felt pt needed transport to the hospital and report provided by Clinical lead.

                                                Chest Pain, Myopericarditis; From EPIC: From cardiologist healthy man who comes to the ER with left anterior chest discomfort for the last 36 hours or so.  Symptoms are made worse by deep inspiration.  Were improved following self administration of 600 mg of ibuprofen earlier today.  2 days ago he received his second COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer).  Following day he experienced arm pain muscular aches and pains severe discomfort of the right arm (injection site) later in the day there was nausea and vomiting on one occasion (nonheme).  By last night he was able to eat dinner but subsequently felt short of breath with worsening chest discomfort morning the left arm continued to ache with musculoskeletal pains.  Developed more discomfort in the left anterior chest radiating to the throat made worse by deep inspiration. Does not describe typical sharp catching pain of pericarditis.  No cough sputum bruising bleeding abdominal pain change in color or character of bowels.  Sign in the emergency room he was hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm with a normal EKG.Torrey work-up notable for an initial troponin of 1.28 and a follow-up troponin of 2.14. Chest x-ray perfectly normal. Elevated d-dimer. CT angiography negative for pulmonary embolism vascular injury, cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion but the radiologist did note thickening of several right posterior and lateral axillary lymph nodes raising a question of recent right-sided vaccination or injury/infection to the right arm. Presently he is perfectly comfortable able to take a deep inspiration with mild chest discomfort, breathing easily.  I met him in July 2018He came to the emergency room with a 3-day viral syndrome manifested as headache nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal discomfort and then developed chest discomfort.  He was found with diffuse mild J-point elevation on EKG consistent with a viral type pericarditis with troponins which rose to a maximum of 10.4.  Work-up for myocarditis was negative.  Echocardiogram perfectly normal.  Symptoms responded to a course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine.  Seen in follow-up of repeat echocardiogram was perfectly healthy.  Our diagnosis was myopericarditis. There is no history of shortness of breath dyspnea on exertion decrement of exercise capacity peripheral edema orthopnea PND palpitations lightheadedness syncope or collapse.  No ill contacts.  He works in a high security position and therefore qualified for early administration of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  Graph past medical history notable only for the episode of myopericarditis and a remote tonsillectomy. There is no significant family history of sudden cardiac death or unusual heart disease. He takes no medications. Patient was recommended to take 4 weeks of ibuprofen and colchicine if needed for worsening chest pain.  Patient was recommended to follow-up closely with his primary care doctor and check ESR, C-reactive protein as well as renal function.  Needs close follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.

                                                Reason for Admission  Patient 22-year-old male with a history of seasonal allergic asthma who presented to ER with a chief complaint of chest pain.  He said he started having multiple episodes of vomiting/fever on Saturday morning, went to urgent care and diagnosed with sinus infection,  prescribed amoxicillin, then  he started having chest pain on Sunday at 4 PM, mid sternum, constant, pressure type of pain, 5 out of 10 in severity, worse with cough and deep breathing/lying down flat a lateral position, better with sitting up/ leaning forward.  No radiation.  Denies lifting any heavy weight or any heavy exercise.  Never had similar symptoms in the past.  He had his second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on May 12.  He denies leg pain or swelling.  His vomiting and fever resolved.   ED: He was found to have troponin of more than 12,000, EKG showed diffuse ST segment elevation with possible repolarization.   Transferred for possible cardiac cath/cardiac MRI.  CT angio chest no PE, normal aorta, no infiltration.  Pending second set of troponin, stat echo, aspirin po  given in the ER.   In addition to the above HPI, he reports having 2 days of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  T-max 103F.  His chest pain began around 4 PM yesterday and he felt like it was initially consistent with his asthma, however it did not improve so around 1:30 AM he states they went to the ER.  He states that the chest pain gets better with exertion, and is worse with deep breaths and lying on his side, or leaning forward. He did take Nyquil decongestant which contains phenylephrine.     Hospital Course   22 yo M w/PMH exercise induced asthma admitted for evaluation of CP, elevated troponin to 21,292 with negative LHC. UDS Negative. EKG w/diffuse ST changes so consistent with Myopericarditis I31.9 given Recent Viral Illness resulting in first time myopericarditis, will treat per pericarditis algorithm, ASA&#43;Colchicine w/90% response rate by 1 week.     -ASA 650 to 1000 mg TID, weekly tapers if CRP normalized and sx free; will start at 650 mg dose   -Colchicine 0.6 mg BID for 3 months, no taper (lowers recurrence rate, NNT = 5)   -Glucocorticoid generally not indicated in first-time acute myopericarditis as observational studies suggest increased recurrence rate, but can consider if he does not adequately respond to aspirin and colchicine   -Trend troponin to ensure downtrend continues   -No strenuous exercise during recovery period

                                                I have always had low grade tinnitus and migraine related visual issues, so this could be a completely a coincidence. However I feel the need to report it just in case. On the night of May 29, I had begun to hear a low noticeable hum in my right ear and a feeling of fullness. This humming disappeared and returned on Tuesday, June 1st 2021, and then continued on and became worse upon waking up on Wednesday June 2nd, 2021. I am scheduling follow ups with an ENT specialist in order to understand the root cause.

Both of my arms had a very tingly feeling and felt  heavy  and then became completely  numb and I was unable to move to either arm for approximately 45 minutes.  Movement slowly came back  throughout the evening and over the next week. My legs felt tingly and heavy. I continue to have periodic tingly feeling in my joints through out my body. My chest felt heavy.  I felt like I was doing to die.  Large red swollen area where shot was given. I have COVID 19 in Feb, 2021. Health care profession suspects the reaction may have been related to having COVID-19, second dose not recommended. Likely to have antibodies. I have not felt 100 percent since receiving vaccine.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) and a contactable other healthcare professional. This consumer reported similar events for two patients (twins). This is the first of two reports.  A 22-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 26Apr2021 10:00 (at the age of 22-year-old) as 2nd dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included ongoing rare metabolic disorder. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735) received at age 22 years, on 05Apr2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. On 26Apr2021, the patient received the second dose of BNT162B2. In the evening of the same day, 26Apr2021, the patient experienced tiredness/fatigue, and headache. In the morning of 27Apr2021, the patient was feeling really crappy and they though it was like the flu and it would pass. In the evening of 27Apr2021, the patient didn&#39;t sleep at all and was uncomfortable all night and pain. On the same day, 27Apr2021, the patient had severe chest pain, chest tightness, and lightheadedness. On 28Apr2021, the pain didn&#39;t go away, and the twins had elevated ST evaluation on the EKG (electrocardiograph). ST evaluation was done by the reporter&#39;s husband who is a retired firefighter emergency medical technician. The reporter decided to take the patient to hospital and said that the other twin had the same symptoms but kept saying his wasn&#39;t as bad as his brother&#39;s because he did not want to go to the hospital. The doctor advised the reporter to bring the other twin. The twins had the same echo cardiogram on 28Apr2021 (unknown results). On 28Apr2021, their troponin levels were elevated, and their cardiac enzymes continued to go up. On the same day, 28Apr2021, the patient had a strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe. It was reported that the twins were hospitalized on 28Apr2021 with myocarditis/pericarditis and inflammation around the heart. Treatment for myocarditis/pericarditis included ibuprofen and colchicine; and Toradol for breakthrough pain. The reporter stated that the twins are two identical males with the same DNA, had the vaccine at the same time, had the reactions at the same length of time, have the same lifestyle and live at the same house. The reporter said it would go a long way if they help her understand the complication. The patient recovered &#34;strange weird bilateral wrist pain severe&#34; on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the event myocarditis and pericarditis/inflammation around the heart was not recovered.  Follow-up (14May2021): New information received from a contactable other healthcare professional includes: reporter details (other hcp added as a new reporter).  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

                                                Patient experienced Myocarditis-like symptoms beginning 05/20/2021, 3 days after Dose 2 vaccination.  See Continuation Page for Item 18 information details. Additional information for Item 18:   Day 1 (5/18) Patient had typical dose 2 reactions of low fever (100-101 degF), headache, soreness at injection site, mild dizziness.  Day 2 (5/19) he felt much better.  On Day 3 (20 May 2021 9:00AM) Patient experienced notable chest pain (level 5-6 on scale of 10) lasting about 30 minutes.  Pain then decreased to level 1-2 for the next several hours.  Patient said this felt exactly like the pain he experienced when he had Myocarditis in Nov 2017, only less severe.  (The 2017 event required 4 days of hospitalization and temporarily left patient with heart failure in one ventricle (Ejection Fraction &lt;40%) although EJ returned to normal after a few months).  patient was seeing his Primary Care Physician on another matter later this same morning (5/20) and mentioned the pain.  PCP listened to his heart and did not note any irregularities. Patient had no additional pain episodes for the next 3 days so we did not worry.  But daily chest pain episodes resumed 5/24, 1 to 3 times a day,  mostly level 1-2, sometimes level 3, typically lasting 30 min to 2 hrs, through 6/3.  From 6/4 and on episodes have been less frequent.   On 5/25 patient contacted his 2017 Cardiologist who ordered a Troponin-I lab.  Labs were done 5/26 and were normal so we were advised to monitor but go to the ER if severe chest pain occurred.  Patient has an office visit scheduled with his Cardiologist July 2.  As of 6/12 (date of report) episodes tend to occur after moderate physical activity but clear after rest.  This pattern is similar to what patient experienced during the first 3 months following his 2017 illness.  Accordingly patient has reduced his physical activity, using chest pain episodes as an indicator of too much activity.  The 2017 illness appeared to be completely resolved after April 2018 with normal ECG, Echo, EJ and no further reports of chest pain even with normal activity levels.  May 20, 2021 was the first time this type of chest pain reoccurred.

Per the Physician Assistant who initially saw stated that his EKG was abnormal than his Troponin level was elevated. Due to concerns withs history of Marfan Syndrome and the possibility of a torn aorta, increased Troponin, abnormal EKG the ED doctor wanted him helicoptered to Hospital&#39;s Cardiac Cath Lab to rule out a torn aorta. was helicoptered to  Hospital taken to the Cardiac Cath Lab ruling out a torn aorta.

                                                On Friday night, April 16,2021, after working all day for his job, Pt told his roomates that he wasn&#39;t feeling well, was throwing up, had the chills and was going to lay down. When the roomates didn&#39;t see him Monday morning, April 19, 2021, they went into his room and found him unresponsive. The medical examiner ruled death due to cancer which appears incorrect considering the evidence.

                                                The side effects didn&#39;t all occur simultaneously. Friday evening I noticed severe arm soreness. Later Friday night (about 10 hours after getting the vaccine) I developed gradual onset chills, body aches, and fatigue. Saturday I woke up with a severe headache, body aches, fatigue, and fever. The headache became severe by mid-day, with fatigue also worsening throughout the day.  Sunday was more of the same, though I believe the fever started inching down and the headache lessened. What developed Sunday afternoon/evening took me off guard though. I noticed a sudden drop in heart rate, a feeling of pressure and discomfort in the chest, nausea, and shortness of breath with exertion (consistently - not just once). (I&#39;m a long-distance runner, so this is unusual for me.) At first I debated going to the emergency room, but since I&#39;m so young and in otherwise good condition I thought nothing of it. I had similar symptoms the following day, but I avoided exerting myself until all of my symptoms from the vaccine had ended. I felt groggy and fatigued for several additional days, but by Saturday (8 days after getting the first dose of Pfizer) everything had resolved. I also developed swollen lymph nodes, which returned to normal size within about 3 weeks (before swelling again after the second vaccine).  The second dose of the vaccine caused a more sudden and intense reaction, though I never developed chest pain/slow heart rate with it.  Instead I developed sudden onset severe chills, fatigue, and body aches about 9 hours after getting the shot. A fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and sudden onset fever (temperature jumped nearly five degrees in about 90 minutes) quickly followed. My fever stabilized around 102.2 around 3 a.m. that morning, and slowly crept down throughout the afternoon/evening. Overall, with dizziness, body aches, extreme fatigue, etc., this was the sickest I&#39;ve been since I had a severe case of the Flu in high school. The fatigue, shortness of breath, and fast heart rate continued for about a week - getting slightly better each day.

When I got home I had become extremely nauseous and developed severe muscle fatigue and severe arthralgia and my headache had increased and became sweaty and dizzy. I slept from 9:00am to 2:00pm where the symptoms had gotten no better and the headache had gotten worse. I slept from 3:00pm to around 6:00pm with the same symptoms but managed to eat some soup and kept it down. I slept from 10pm to 12pm the next day 12/10/20. My fatigue and joint pain had somewhat dissipated but I was still experiencing severe nausea and a severe headache. By the end of 12/10/20 around 8pm my joint pain and muscle fatigue had gotten better but the nausea and headache were still there. 12/11/20 I was well enough to drive and receive a covid test. My nausea and headache did not go away until the end of day 12/11/20

                                                I had injection site pain about 4 or 5 hours after my injection. Around 9:15 at night I felt slightly warm and could tell that I was becoming febrile, but I wasn&#39;t completely there yet. Around 12:45AM on January 9th, I had massive chills and uncontrollable shivering and muscle aches. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen at 6:00AM when my chills came back. At 10:45AM I was feeling febrile again, and took 600 mg of ibuprofen followed by an hour and a half nap. I had slight malaise afterwards but did not feel febrile. By 5PM, I was feeling almost completely normal and was fever free. On the morning of 1/10, I am completely recovered.

Around hour 10, a fever of 100° F set in and quickly rose to 102° before hour 12. Fever reached 103° by hour 12.5 and broke by hour 13. After fever broke, vomiting/dry heaving occurred for roughly 2 hours. Lethargy/ LOC set in around hour 16 and the former remained until around hour 48. After the course, I began to feel fine, I just wanted to report how adverse my side effects were compared to those of my coworkers.

This was accompanied by a mass that developed under my right armpit, about 4-5 cm in diameter and bulging out to the point that I felt it touching my upper arm before I even saw it in a mirror. It was not red, and it was malleable with a small, hard nodule in the center. I used an ice compression and some ibuprofen over a few days, and it has receded about 95% of the way, almost back to normal.

I transported him to a private holding room via wheelchair and gave him a 12 oz can of Coca-Cola. He took sips and immediately reported feeling better. The initial vital signs I took were as follows: Temp 98.6 F, HR 67, BP 84/48 mmHg, RR 24/min, and SpO2 97%.  After recheck in 15 min BP improved to 106/62 mmHg, his became more pink and no more diaphoresis. I observed him for 30 minutes total and he was stable to go home. He drove himself home.

I ran from my living room to my bedroom and got under the sheets, I was very very cold. My whole body was twitching violently, and I had extreme muscle pain. Joints popped like knuckles cracking that I wouldn&#39;t normally be able to pop. This lasted for about 10 minutes very violently and then calmed down over another 10, and I just felt very very feverish. I felt numb all over but I was shivering a little. Moving was very hard and my whole back was very sore, with the injection arm in a little extra pain. Fell asleep until about 7:30 am, woke up still a little feverish. I have had waves of extreme dizziness and muscle aches continuing even to today a couple days later. I am also experiencing a rather persistent headache in the very center of my head, making it hard to think. I lose track of my thoughts and it feels like I can&#39;t focus, this seems to be improving gradually over time. treatment only included extra fluid intake and over the counter pain killers

                                                Vasovagal syncope in the 15 minute waiting period. Response by staff was great: laid me down, brought a cot, regularly checked my heart rate, blood oxygen, and blood pressure until it returned to normal and waited to make sure the symptoms did not return.   Later that night, I started experiencing some of the typical COVID vaccine side effects: sore arm, chills, nausea, and fever-like symptoms; in addition to the symptoms I was warned was possible, I also experienced periods of dizziness and an uncomfortable sense of balance. Three days later, the dizziness and other common symptoms have gone away, but my sense of balance still feels off, although I do not know if related to the vaccine. It?s not so bad that I?m at risk of falling over, but I have a semi-regular feeling of unsteadiness which I cannot explain.

                                                As the night went on I started to feel more and more fatigued at work(more than would be normal). I left early and felt a little nauseated by the time I got home. I went to sleep within 2 hours(around 12am). I woke up about 5 hours later with extreme fever symptoms(chills, nausea, fatigue, soreness) and a very intense headache. I contracted Covid-19 in October 2020 and this was much like how I felt when I was sick with the virus, minus the cough. Everything was mostly cleared up by the evening however.

A 23-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 27Mar2021 (between 11:55AM and 12:00PM) (Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: Jul2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 via Intramuscular, at the age of 23-year-old, administered in right arm on 06Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6206, Expiry: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. He felt really terrible yesterday (07Apr2021). On Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well, and he could barely sleep last night (07Apr2021). His head felt heavy on Tuesday night (06Apr2021), and his head felt super heavy last night (07Apr2021). On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced fatigue, on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow/throat pain, really bad headache, sensation of pressure in ear, sensation of pressure in eye, dizzy on standing, a little bit of nausea with the dizziness, really weak, he didn&#39;t eat yesterday because he had no appetite, chills/teeth chattering, shaking, hot feeling generalized, sweating, feeling hot and cold. The patient experienced not feeling well on an unspecified date. Patient started developing symptoms that were very bad, he thought he had COVID. Patient had a PCR test that was negative. Patient would like to know if a delayed response after second dose is normal. Reported he had received his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose about 2 weeks ago (27Mar2021). He said he felt really terrible yesterday. He said he felt so bad that he thought he had the COVID-19 Virus, and went to get tested. He clarified he had a real time COVID-19 Virus PCR test yesterday (07Apr2021), and received a negative result today (08Apr2021), less than 24 hours after having the test performed. He said it could be something else that was making him feel terrible. He said he had a (telehealth) appointment with a doctor tomorrow (09Apr2021). Caller asked if Pfizer had any data with the second COVID-19 Vaccine for people that had a really delayed immune response with their immune system. He said he had no symptoms after his second COVID-19 Vaccine, and was wondering if what he was experiencing now was a delayed immune response. Reported last night was the worst for his symptoms, saying it was awful. He said he felt better this morning. He clarified that on Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well. He said his head felt heavy, but when he woke up, he did not feel too bad. He said he had fatigue, and on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow. He said last night (07Apr2021), he had a really bad headache, and his head felt super heavy. He said he had ear and eye pressure. He said he got dizzy on standing, and at one point, had a little bit of nausea with the dizziness. He said he wasn&#39;t sure if the nausea was caused by the dizziness. He said he was really weak, and didn&#39;t eat yesterday because he had no appetite. He said he took his temperature at around 8:00PM-9:00PM last night, and had no fever. He said he still had his sense of taste and smell. He said he had chills, he was shaking, and his teeth were chattering. He said he was also hot and sweating at times, like he was alternating between hot and cold. He said he tried to drink water yesterday, and would take a few sips of water when he turned over in bed. He said he could barely sleep. Treatment: Reported he took Ibuprofen 200mg tablets, off and on, to treat his headache because his headache was preventing him from sleeping. He said he would take 2 Ibuprofen 200mg tablets at a time. He said he took his first Ibuprofen dose in the middle of the night on Tuesday, and then took 2 more doses of 2 Ibuprofen 200mg tablets last night. He said he did not have the Ibuprofen 200mg tablet NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date because he had taken Ibuprofen from a different Ibuprofen 200mg bottle and put it in the Ibuprofen 200mg he was taking from. Reported he felt he had gained strength back today (08Apr2021) because he had showered this morning, and didn&#39;t fall over. He said he was so weak yesterday, even trying to text for his work was bad.

As I tried to sleep, I had difficulty sleeping. The next day, I awoke with a splitting headache and my body aching worse than before including my neck which was impossible for me to look around. Still felt a little cold. Head was hurting a lot. Slept better the second night. Awoke on Sunday with mainly head hurting and body aching a little less.

                                                First day: severe chills (extreme body shaking), and body temperature alternating between overheating and moderate/severe chills every several hours. Body fatigue, temperature varying from low 99 F up to 101.3 F. These symptoms subsided after about 2 days. Also developing during this time was an asthma attack, characterized by wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Patient has had life-long history of asthma, moderate, well-maintained with albuterol inhaler (life-long) and Qvar redihaler (beginning in early-mid 2020). However, after the common symptoms subsided, the asthma attack prolonged for over a week (2nd injection on 22 Apr 2021, and present as of reporting (03 May 2021). Albuterol inhaler would ease the wheezing, but no effect on mitigating the coughing / difficulty breathing. Qvar redihaler had no effect. Asthma attack would alternate in waves (approximately every hour up to 4-6 hour cycles), of breathing mostly clearly (some difficulty persisting), and severe attacks when extremely difficult to breathe.

A 23-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0170) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 22Apr2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included being a smoker (he vapes). The patient&#39;s sister has Addison&#39;s disease. There were no concomitant medications; no additional vaccines administered on the same date as BNT162B2 and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient previously received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EB8733) at the age of 23-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 01Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 22Apr2021 at 14:00. He woke up on 23Apr2021 and felt like he had sinus pressure, then he blew his nose and had a bit of a nosebleed. He also felt like he could taste blood in his throat and mouth. The nosebleed stopped, but there was still some pressure in his sinuses. He asked if he needed to go to the hospital. He has a headache and it seemed like a sinus headache. It was more on the right side where he had the nosebleed. He could still kind of taste a little bit of blood in his mouth and throat. There were no relevant tests, but he was trying to figure out if it&#39;s needed. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. He was not hospitalized but he was trying to decide if he needed to go to the hospital. The outcome of the event nose bleed was recovered on 23Apr2021 and not recovered for all other events.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.  Follow-up (23Apr2021): New information from a contactable consumer (patient) includes: patient details, medical history, historical vaccine, therapy details, reaction data (&#34;Can taste blood in his throat and mouth&#34; and &#34;has a headache and it seems like a sinus headache&#34; were added; outcome and onset were updated), and course of events.

                                                Sore joints; his butt is still a little sore from falling; dizziness/ light headed; fainting; pain in upper abdomen area; Sweating; Nausea; falling; This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 23-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 at 1 pm (around 12:20ish as reported) (Lot Number: FN6206) (at 23-year-old) at single dose in arm right for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history relevant to AEs. The patient stated he is a pretty healthy guy. All day after getting the vaccine he was fine. He got the shot at like 1 came home took a nap, ate some dinner, and was playing XBOX with the boys when this happened. At around 10:30 pm on 29Apr2021 he went to rub, his stomach just above his belly button and it hurt. He said that he read on line that that area is called the pancreas or liver, it has a lot of names for that area when looking online. He stated it&#39;s the left upper abdomen area he felt pain when he pressed on it. It radiated really fast across his abdomen while he was on the phone with mother. The more he pressed the more the pain got sharper, and it radiated right across the abdomen, mainly above belly button not too much in lower abdomen, not much in upper abdomen. It was very sensitive. He didn&#39;t have to press hard to trigger the pain. It was almost like the area was inflamed. It happened really fast and that it was his upper stomach not so much the lower part of his abdomen. He felt dizziness and nauseous and like a silly boy he tried to run to the bathroom. He stated that he fell and fainted. His butt was still a little sore from falling. He said when he woke up, he was sweating like he had been out side all day. He did not recall sweating any time he fainted in the past. The side effects were gone after about ten minutes. He was really light headed and had the crazy sharp pain in abdomen for about ten minutes and then it was gone. He had never had that kind of pain. He was laying on the floor for a couple minutes. He went to get his phone, and then sat back down and was sweating. He still had pain at that time but it only lasted about 10 minutes at most. He was still a little bit sore in some joints which was not unexpected. He confirmed that he had a little bit of sweating, and he fainted a little bit. Since the episode he hasn&#39;t felt any symptoms like that before, he has not had any pain like gastritis but he has had some random gastrointestinal things before. It&#39;s also reported nausea on 29Apr2021. No required to emergency room and physician office. He was on the verge of going to the ER while the pain was there. He was going to go until it stopped and to get checked out. No relevant test. The outcome of the events sore joints, dizziness and butt sore was unknown; for other events was resolved on 29Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                My first dose of the pfizer vaccine was relatively asymptomatic. Received at local hospital. Sore arm that lasted a few hours, nothing too concerning.  This adverse event describes my second dose however, received Jan 23, 2020, approximately 3 weeks after the first. Again, this was received at local hospital. The next day, I felt the expected side effects of terrible chills, whole-body myalgia, and a slight fever. Again, I was not too worried as this was expected. I could not sleep that night, but otherwise, I felt significantly better in the morning.   Unfortunately, on Jan 25, 2 days after the second dose, I began to feel a strange tingling sensation in my forearms, and a pain in my lower back. This paresthesia felt as if the insides of my arms were vibrating, and rather than a &#34;pins and needles&#34; sensation, I felt electric shocks through my forearms and extremely discomforting tingles. I could not bend forward without terrible shocks through my arms, and my back pain can only be described as aching. I immediately scheduled an appointment with my doctor for Monday afternoon, That entire Sunday, it felt as if the tingling sensation, rated at 7/10 discomfort, grew to 10/10. I physically was wincing and turning, unable to find any position where my arms were not experiencing electric vibrations. My back pain, which was tender to touch, and if I pressed hard enough on it or laid on my back, caused the same electric sensation not just in the forearms but the entirety of my upper torso and my arm. Taking deep breaths was painful, as it elicited the same discomforting paresthesia. At the time, I was one of the first groups taking the pfizer shots, and it was still unclear if taking NSAIDs was a good idea to alleviate pains and the suppress the immune response. I agonized that entire Sunday and through Monday morning, the shocking expanding from just the forearms to the shoulders around the deltoid, and the back pain soon covered my entire upper torso. For whatever reason, waist-down I was completely fine. Even bending forward only elicited the pain upwards, nothing ever went down my legs. I had slight neck stiffness, a throbbing headache, intense back aches, bilateral upper extremity paresthesia, and pain on deep inspiration at the height of my pain on Monday morning. By this point, the pain had kept me awake for almost 30 hours.  When I finally could see my doctor via telehealth appointment, he prescribed me 800 mg ibuprofen to be taken every 6-8 hours I believe. After taking the ibuprofen, the pain lessened significantly, going from 10/10 to 2/10. I was finally able to go to sleep sitting up straight on a sofa chair. The paresthesia was gone, the pain on deep inspiration was gone, but the tenderness and dull ache in the lower back seemed to stay even on the ibuprofen. I noticed that if I laid down on my back to try and sleep, even with the medicine in full effect, the electric shooting and paresthesia would immediately return. If I quickly removed pressure from that area, it went away.  The ibuprofen&#39;s effect lasted only about 5 hours. I would take another as it slowly crawled back up to 4/10 pain or if the paresthesia was returning. Over the course of an entire week, I constantly needed to be on ibuprofen. By Friday, so almost 6 days after the shot, the paresthesia and back pain could be completely suppressed by the ibuprofen and I was able to lay on my back with no problems. Without medicine, I was sitting at a dull 3-10 back pain, but the paresthesia was gone. The back pain finally vanished on Sunday, 8 days after the shot, and I no longer needed ibuprofen. No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, radiation of electrical pain down the leg, vision change, or loss of bowel/urinary control throughout the course of these symptoms.  My experience reported to my primary care doctor, via our health messages. I did not return any contact to hospital or my vaccination site.

But from that day until now I still get a weird feeling in my left chest. I feel like my heart is twitching sometimes. Sometimes I felt that my heart was pounding. Sometimes it feels like it&#39;s going to hurt my heart. It happened continuously about 5-6 times a day. Sometimes I was paranoid about it.

Symptoms seemed to die out in a few hours, then came back full force through that night, keeping me awake and in agony for several hours

                                                I am healthy 23 year old male. I have never suffered from any sort of illness or conditions. After massive push by the goverment and incentivization to take the New Covid-19 Vaccines deemed safe , I went ahead and received the Pfizer shot on 05/24/2021. A day after I felt headache and dizziness. This stopped on the third day. Later I would have episodes of blurred vision. That stopped. But what has really affected me and continues to affect me , is that a week after I have developed major difficulty breathing.  I never , ever not even once in my life have suffered from breathing problems. It all started on an afternoon a week after the shot randomly with really fast heart palpitations and after those palpitations stopped I was choking, I could not breathe at all. After this , I am having trouble breathing normally or getting enough air in along with tightness in the chest area. For instance, I struggle with two breaths and then the third I will likely get more air in. I have felt incredible tightness in my chest. There has been nights where I cannot sleep because I am unable to breathe , and feel like I am choking. So , I need to get up and walk around the house to catch my breath.  I am having shortness of breath  and my breathing is not like it used to be. I do not have any fever or any other symptoms , the persisting problem is the tightness and difficulty breathing. I already went to the Pulmonary doctor a couple days ago and underwent testing that are pending.  I do not understand why this happened to me , I am not sure if it is a coincidence or if there is a relation between  me having taken that Pfizer shot . But prior to taking that vaccine I never  once had trouble with  my breathing  and never felt tightness around my chest. This is new to me and it scares me to think this might stay with me forever, whatever it is. I pray it goes away. I am still having trouble . and the fact that in the past I never thought about my breathing because it was normal, and now it is a constant issue throughout  the day,  moments when I can get air and others when it is very difficult. I  am reporting this  to leave a record of this incident because prior to me taking this vaccine , I was in fact a fully healthy person free of any sort of health issues.

Highest temp 102, took tylenol every 4 hours to help with fever and aches. At 9:30 pm began with continuous strong chest pain/shortness of breath. Nothing made it feel better. 9:45 PM Called after hour line of primary physician, who recommended going to ER. Left for ER at 10 PM. Chest pain had eased somewhat on the way to ER. Was seen at ER. Received EKG, lab work, CT scan, IV fluids and toradol. Chest pain was mild in ER and felt better by discharge around 3:30 AM.  Felt normal by 4/19/21 and returned to work. Have seen a few reports in news about myocarditis/pericarditis in males which seem to fit patients experience, so wanted to report the incident.

                                                Had a night fever at 3am on June 19. Felt hot, dehydrated, and weak. Took 200mg ibuprofen pill with water and slept again but was uncomfortable. Also felt dizzy and fatigue at night. My heart was also beating fast. When I woke up at 10am the symptoms seem to be less intense and better. I didn&#39;t feel hot. However, I still felt weak in my body. At 1pm when I started earing lunch I felt hot, tired and dizzy again, I was really sleepy, didn&#39;t feel like eating, and felt like vomiting. I drank coke soda instead and slept until 4pm and I took another 200mg ibuprofen pill with water, after which I felt better.

The symptoms were very noticeable at the onset, and around noon by the next day it was much more tolerable (though I had taken two ibupofen in the morning as I had a headache as well). The day after and two days after the shot, there was noticeable fatigue, though that could have been due to not getting much sleep the first night because of body temperature changes.

Went to urgent care evening of 2nd day, received 50mg diphenhydramine that suppressed itching enough to sleep. Woke up itching and red at 6am of 3rd day, took 25mg diphenhydramine. Took 40mg prednisone at 8am. Went to urgent care at 10am for worsening hives, spreading and covering torso and onto face. Received dexamethasone injection into glute and prednisone prescription was upped to 50mg daily for the next week.  Took OTC Zyrtec and Pepcid once following the second urgent care visit. Hives responded well after 2hrs post visit, assuming due to prednisone and dexamethasone. Day 4 (1/12/20) woke up with widespread hives that became further inflamed until an hour after prednisone taken with breakfast. Also woke up with slight sore throat and wheezing, both of which subsided. Currently scheduled to see an allergist on 1/13/20. No known allergies and no other known introduction of allergens in the past week.

I waited for 30 minutes and was perfectly fine.  Around 5 pm I started to feel symptoms.  I got the worst aches in my entire body i&#39;ve ever felt before, along with chills.  I felt extremely hot, I took my temperature and had a fever of 102.3.  I felt dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseas .  My head was throbbing.  I ended up taking 1000mg of tylenol to help reduce the fever, which seemed to really help.  I fell asleep and woke up the next morning drenched in sweat.  My fever was gone, but I still had a horrible headache and threw up from the nausea I was having.  It felt like I had a horrible hangover.

                                                Woke up approximately 14 hours after receiving dose #2 with body fatigue. My large joints (e.g., hips, knees, elbows, shoulders) started to develops aches/discomfort. A hot shower helped relieve the initial discomfort, and I took 1g of APAP ~45 minutes after waking up. I then reported to work, which is an ambulatory care clinic that is working a drive-up clinic. As such, I had to work outside in ~20F weather. I had 4 layers on my upper body and 2 layers on lower body with wool socks. The cold did not bother me for the first two hours as I was able to return to a warm area between patients; however, as work became busy, I spent more time outside. The aches/discomfort in my joints progressively worsened as well as the general bodily fatigue. I took another 500mg of APAP, but it did not help much more. Eventually, the cold and body fatigue made breathing uncomfortable, and my breathing became slightly labored. Returning to the warm environment helped the symptoms not get worse, but focusing on tasks became slightly difficult. I returned home at approximately 1630, took another 1g of APAP, and proceeded to sleep from ~1730 until 0530 the next morning. I woke up feeling much better.

                                                On Friday morning 2/26/21, we had a 24 yo male patient who had an anaphylactic reaction after his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He was instructed to wait on the chair, but had stood up at some point but was still in the pharmacy waiting area. A team member noticed he had fainted and called for help. The pharmacist on duty and immunizing tech came immediately to help him to a chair. At that point, he was conscious and talking. Then within a few seconds he started convulsing on the chair and lost consciousness. His eyes were open and head tilted back. A team member immediately called 911 and pharmacist administered 0.3mg Epipen to the thigh. We removed his face mask to check his breathing and also to allow him to breathe more easily. We also adjusted his head more forward and he started coughing. After about 15 seconds, he regained consciousness and could answer questions. EMT arrived soon after and took over. Patient does not have allergies or any history of anaphylaxis/ severe reaction from vaccinations. He did express some fear of needles and did not eat breakfast yet.

I was then moved to the observation area where my chest got tight, I had difficulty breathing and my temperature fluctuated which made me shake. When hives began to show on my face, neck and ears the on-site medical staff gave me a shot of epinephrine and Benadryl and put me on oxygen, during this time an ambulance was called by the staff. When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

Around 6am I measured my axillary temperature to be 100.9 F and took 650 Tylenol once which broke the fever. I was unable to go in to work that day. Now, two days after the vaccine, my other symptoms have resolved aside from a painful, and visibly noticable, lymph adenopathy in my left arm pit the same side as the vaccine.

I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

He was extremely pale and sweating profusely all over. We took his blood pressure and it was about 94/50. His heart rate was 50. We got the patient water and continued to monitor him and he improved.

I normally sleep through the night with no issues whatsoever (I&#39;m a healthy 6&#39;1&#34; 170lb 24-year-old guy with no co-morbidities) but had a restless night where my fever eventually rose to 101 degrees Fahrenheit.  This continued throughout the next 48 hours with my fever fluctuating between 99.5 and 101.  I woke up 5-6 times both nights completely drenched in sweat.

                                                This 24 yo male reports receipt of his first Pfizer Covid vaccine lot #EN6199 to his Left deltoid.  He advised within &lt;15 minutes following the vaccine he sensed the left side of his neck was swelling.  He notified Immunization staff who brought him to the ER via w/c. He stated the ERMD did not perceive/palpate any swelling or nodules, and treated him with IV Benadryl with resolution of s/s.  He did not require any other doses of benadryl.    He received his 2nd Pfizer covid vaccine on 3/30/2021 lot#ER8734 to right deltoid.  He stated within 15 min again, he had the sensation of throat stiffness (as if muscles really tight/tensed) and this made it difficult to breath and caused his chest to hurt. He was taken to the ER again and given Benadryl again with resolution of symptoms. He was released later without any reoccurrence of symptoms. He states he went to work on 3/31 where he began to feel bad/achy-feverish.  Today he had a fever (not taken), total body aches but mostly to his left hand.  He reports feeling fatigue and unable to do normal AM routine of working out.  He could only stretch today.  He denies any trauma, recent illness, difficulty breathing, swallowing, eating, ha, n/v/d, or other symptoms.

This episode lasted about 5 minutes from onset was realized until resolution.

                                                platelets completely crashed; arm got a little sore; felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms; felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (reporting on himself). A 24-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection, lot number: SH1555218 and expiration date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 21Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing 22Q (diagnosed with this condition when he was about 4 years old). Immunodeficiency from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included rituximab (RITUXAN) taken for immunodeficiency, start and stop date were not reported. Patient states he received the 1st dose on 21Mar2021 about 9:00am or a little before that time and had a very bad side effect and was in the hospital for a couple of days. His weight was 162 or 163 pounds. Patient was immunocompromised and has issues regarding that lately and received Rituximab which is like a chemo; states after he had the Pfizer Vaccine on 21Mar2021, his arm that the vaccine was administered into got a little sore relatively soon after the shot and the main thing he was reporting that his platelets completely crashed which was the reason for the hospitalization (from 24Mar2021 to 26Mar2021). Patient states for the Rituximab he gets due to having some issues being immunocompromised, it was his 4th treatment with the Rituximab and states he has no lot numbers, dosages, expiry dates or NDC numbers to provide and states he was on the Rituximab for his immunocompromised status. His arm soreness was in the same arm that he had the Pfizer vaccine administered into and would say the following day after getting the Pfizer vaccine, he felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms that resolved completely like 2 days later and these symptoms went away. Patient was immunocompromised and has fairly serious health issues since he was age 4-5 and was able to get the vaccine with his HCP. Rituxan was the only medication he can think of to include in this report. Patient did not require a visit to the emergency room or the HCP office but was actually just getting the last dose of his treatment with Rituxan and then they drew his labs and the labs stated his platelet count had completely crashed the last time they checked his lab work. His platelet count was 3000 on 26Mar2021 and the platelets went up relatively quickly after that. Patient did not have treatment other than just the steroid of the very high dose Dexamethasone. Patient would like Pfizer&#39;s opinion and was not entirely sure he can get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and was asking what was recommended; patient aware that Pfizer was unable to offer medical advice or treatment recommendations and was referred to his HCP. Patient still on steroids very high dose Dexamethasone and got IVIG in the hospital; states he has no lot numbers, expiry dates, dosages or NDC numbers for the Dexamethasone or IVIG to provide. He has his patient card for the Pfizer Vaccine and states for the lot number, he thinks it was SH1555218 but does not locate other information including other numbers that could be the lot or the expiry date or the NDC number; states the patient card information was not handwritten and he can&#39;t tell what the lot number was and states this information was embedded like a bar code on his patient card. The outcome for the events platelets completely crashed, arm got a little sore was unknown and for events felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms was recovered on 24Mar2021.

                                                I experienced chills, which intensified in the evening into full body shudders before finally calming. Alongside this, I felt extremely sore, especially in the joints and feet, like they had or were being pressed or squeezed. This made it hard to move around or get out of bed. I also experienced a headache, and likely a fever.  I had similar symptoms after my first shot, but while those symptoms were still noticeable and took me out of work, I had a much stronger reaction this time around. I have been experiencing a sore neck and shoulders due to tension even until today.

                                                Significant fogginess of brain which has only worsened and is still lingering to now (4/18/21). Simultaneously this is mixed with fatigue regardless of how much sleep I get or water that I drink. Less frequently I have symptoms like eyes burning (similar to bad allergies), slight dizziness, minor headaches, and minor body aches. The fatigue and brain fog are by far the worst and still persist, the others listed are minor but still come and go in small amounts. On Wednesday (4/14) I took Zyrtec (10mg tablet) to help focus throughout the day then one ibuprofen tablet (200mg) at night, and on Friday (4/16) I only took the Zyrtec. Since then I have not taken any medications. The symptoms were alleviated by the medication but without them all symptoms come and go to varying degrees throughout the day and worsen by night time.

Compelled by an act of stupidity to eat a muffin at 10:30pm went to bed around midnight. Woke up around 1am feeling queasy and began projectile vomiting. Evacuated all of that and then had a dry heave and it was over. In all only lasted about 6-7 minutes. I got the sheet I was handed when I was given my vaccine and saw this website. I looked at the chart and saw this did occur with the second dose and  saw that this was relatively common in getting the second shot of the vaccine and just wanted to report it since I?m not about to go to sleep. Checked my temperature and it is around 96 and was around 98 when I was going to bed at around 11pm

Echocardiogram showing no significant abnormalities.  HOSPITAL COURSE: A 24-year-old male, primary care patient, received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination 3 days prior to admission.  Following this, he had a fever, chills, body aches, and then developed severe chest pain.  The pain was worse lying flat, better when sitting up and leaning forward and worse with a deep breath.  He had gone to an urgent Care and was recommended going to the emergency room.  The patient&#39;s troponins were elevated and his EKG was fairly classic for pericarditis.  He was felt to have probably viral myopericarditis and was admitted for observation.  He was placed on aspirin and colchicine.  He seems stable from Cardiology to be discharged on this regimen as well as symptomatic treatment.  It was not known whether the COVID vaccine was implicated with this or not.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: CONDITION:  Stable and improved.  MEDICATIONS: 1. Colchicine 0.6 mg b.i.d. 2. Aspirin 650 mg t.i.d. 3. Oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg every 4 hours p.r.n. for pain. 4. Zofran 4 mg sublingual q.8 hours p.r.n. for nausea.  DIET: Regular.  ACTIVITY: As tolerated.  FOLLOWUP: With Cardiology on May 3rd.  If worsened pain, shortness of breath, or high fever, return for evaluation sooner.  In which case, steroids may be administered.

                                                Normal reaction the following day, strong fatigue, headache, nausea, arm soreness. Disappeared 36 hours later. 3 days later experienced heavy nausea, anxiety, gastrointestinal discomfort. Heavy bloating, inability to pass gas, loose stool/diarrhea all week. 7 days post vaccination symptoms came back, feeling of wanting to vomit, strong nausea, loss of appetite. 7-14 days later lost majority of appetite, eating aversion, heavy bloating, nausea and continuing diarrhea. Weakness, fatigue and shaking. Received Stool sample and blood test April 13. Elevated levels of albumin and red blood cell count. Doctor said it was most likely from dehydration. Zofran prescribed April 13 and only taken 2 days. Nausea subsided and ability to eat came back slowly. Since April 15th have been eating more food, but still have to force myself to eat. Hunger pangs rarely felt, only know when hungry when stomach churns and fatigue sets in. Today, April 28, still experiencing slight anxiety, loose stools once every other day, brain fog and depression. Lack of emotion, irritability and  periodic upset stomach still persist, along with appetite loss. Am able to eat filling meals again, but no appetite makes food less appealing. Failure to thrive still evident and feeling like I won&#39;t get better evident. Treatment during illness was minimal, urgent care did nothing other than prescribe zofran. Gastroenterologist and GP cannot see me for another 2 weeks.

A 24-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158; Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eye allergy. Concomitant medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AMOXICILINA CLAV) taken for eye allergy from 12Apr2021. On 14Apr2021, he received the first dose of the vaccine about an hour ago and waited five minutes and went to the bathroom. He had a severe reaction while patient was in the bathroom, he started to feel dizzy, had a terrible headache and chills. He walked out of the bathroom at the store and fell out completely in front of the pharmacists. The patient also experienced weak with shilling (as reported) and started sweating. The pharmacists called 911 and the responders checked his vitals and blood pressure and all of that and everything was fine. Patient clarified he passed out completely for almost 5 minutes. Patient stayed there with everyone until, they were waiting to see how he was doing. He reported he was feeling much better now, still feel a bit dizzy, not 100% but not as bad as when it happened. It has improved and he definitely felt terrible at the time. He was monitoring himself at home to see if he notices something weird going on. He does not have a headache right now and was feeling much better. When he was having the effect, he was mentally sharp, and knew what was going on. He thought about letting himself walk outside the bathroom so he could be seen. He didn&#39;t lose track of what was going on and body reacted adversely. He remembered stuff and everything and he felt good. Patient stated the chills went away; however, would not say they went away completely, he was recovering. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office and the paramedic said it was not necessary right now because all the vitals and everything else seemed fine. There was no therapy received for the events. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the vaccine and no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of events feeling dizzy, terrible headache, chills was recovering; still feeling very sick was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

                                                After receiving the Pfizer vaccine the patient had a small drop of blood. I grabbed a cotton swab and asked the patient to hold still. He said that he did not handle blood well. About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient stated that he was feeling like he needed to lay down. I laid him down in the booth area and obtained a BP 102/48, HR 43 normal cuff, supine position, left arm. Technician and I then elevated the patient&#39;s feet on a chair as the patient was appearing pale. Technician and I placed a ice pack on the back of the patient&#39;s neck as he was feeling hot/clammy. After about 15 minutes the patient was feeling much better and his blood pressure returned to normal - 108/55 HR 53, normal cuff, supine position, left arm. Patient stated that he was a avid cardio exerciser. The patient was then instructed to wait another 10 minutes and then he checked in before leaving and said he was feeling great.

                                                During screening questions patient reported a one time history of passing out after a vaccine when he was a teenager. Patient received first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine and sat in chairs to be observed. About 15 minutes later I walked out to check on the patient and he was staring straightforward, sweating, and pale. When asked if he was okay he stated his vision was looking blurry and felt dizzy. Took patient&#39;s blood pressure, elevated his legs as I couldn&#39;t move him safely at the time, gave him water to drink, applied cool compresses to neck and forehead. Patient was observed by a clinic staff member during entire event. Rechecked patient&#39;s blood pressure 5 minutes later at resolution of symptoms. Patient then left with adult visitor that came with him.

                                                Around 12:05pm on 5/5/21, Five minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient fainted while in the waiting room.  We came out to assist and at that point the patient was already sitting up, but on the floor.  We were able to speak to him and gave him some water to drink.  We called 911, when we were aware he had fainted.  I was the pharmacist on duty, but not the one that vaccinated him.  So I stayed with him.  There was a moment when he took his sweater off saying he was hot, and I saw sweat bullets on his forehead.  So I got some paper towels for him and took his temperature, which read around 98 degrees.  A few seconds later he turned pale and fell over, hitting his head on one of the shelves.  I quickly got him off the shelf and held his head in my arms .  He opened his eyes and started talking and wanting to sit up, but we kept him laying down and continued to ask him questions to keep him alert.  He was able to answer the questions, knew where he was, who he was, who he was with .  The paramedics then arrived and he was taken out of the store on a stretcher.  We provided a copy of the report he filled out to the paramedics .

                                                Patient broke out in a cold sweat, became pale, and unresponsive within 10 minutes of his vaccine 3:20pm.  His breathing rate remained normal so a decision was made to call the patient&#39;s wife, who is a nurse, instead of calling EMS.  The patient slowly regained consciousness approximately 10 minutes later.  His color improved somewhat, but he mentioned being tired and cold.  The patient went home under the care of his wife at approximately 3:50pm.

                                                24-year-old male with no prior medical problems presents for evaluation of chest pain.  Patient complains of midsternal chest pain that started approximately an hour ago.  He states that it woke him up from sleep.  Pain is sharp without any radiation or other associated symptoms including diaphoresis presyncopal symptoms or palpitations.  He denies any significant air hunger or shortness of breath.  He otherwise had been feeling better after what he tall was post COVID vaccine symptoms.  Patient received a 2nd dose of pfizer vaccine 3 days ago.  He states that within 24 hours he had symptoms of myalgia fever and feeling unwell.  That has been resolving patient has been feeling better until the chest pain today. Patient otherwise denies any other medical problems in.  He denies any history of drug use including any recent cocaine or other drug abuse.   Elevated cardiac enzymes and chest discomfort are likely secondary to myocarditis and secondary to vaccination/ inflammatory reaction.  Although there is low likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease as well.  I recommended cardiac catheterization for clarification.  He does not want to have the procedure done, understands the risk of undiagnosed coronary artery disease and risk of MI.  He would like to be discharged home.    I reviewed the images of echocardiogram and it seems that he has a small area of hypokinesis in infero basal segment.   Recommended to take aspirin and be seen in Cardiology office in 2 weeks.  Advised to abstain from exercise and significant physical activity till that time and return to the hospital if any symptoms.       Subjective:   I saw patient in consultation for evaluation of chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes.   Patient is a 24-year-old healthy male who had COVID-19 vaccination with his second Pfizer shot 4/14/21. He developed fever, chills, nausea and vomiting 1 day after vaccination.  He did not have any reaction to the 1st dose.   He presented to the hospital with substernal chest discomfort which woke him up from sleep, radiated to throat and had a throbbing feeling.  This lasted for 1 to 2 hours and subsided completely in the hospital.   He smokes 5 cigarettes a day, is physically very active and exercises regularly.  He is not on any medication at home.

After another day, all cold symptoms were gone.   Tinnitus in the right ear started 3 days after 2nd Pfizer COVID shot. Initially was only audible at night, when sleeping in a quiet room, but after 2 days became audible during day.  Tinnitus presented as a high pitched steady ringing in the ear. Triggered intense anxiety and perception of the tinnitus increased to almost debilitating levels. Mental health counseling and prescription of daily amitriptyline to help with sleep and lorazepam to take as needed for anxiety has helped cope with tinnitus and associated mental aspects. Ringing still persists after almost four weeks after it started, but is perceived to be less loud now.

                                                Since my second shot of the vaccine, I have been experiencing chest pain. My chest feels tight and hurts a little bit. Any psychical  exertion causes the tightness and pain to increase a lot, like i&#39;m being stabbed by a knife.  If I go on a walk, it gets really bad and I start to feel it in my throat and back. It subsides if I lay down or sit still for a while. It seems to be caused by movement and exertion. Also, my left toe is now partially numb. It is not fully numb, but feels like pins and needles when I touch it. This has been happening since I got the second shot I think.

                                                Days following dose 2, I began having fluid retention and elevated blood pressure.  Over time, it has worsened.  I am now having dizzy spells that can last 10 minutes to 6 hours up to twice a day, confusion/brain fog and heart flutters/elevated heart rate usually accompanied with fatigue.  My previous doctor treated me by increasing the metoprolol and adding hydrochlorothiazide for fluid retention.  I saw a new healthcare provider who is sending me to a cardiologist, neurologist, lipidologist and endocrinologist to figure out what is going  on.  I can not function in daily life. I cannot stand when dizzy and cannot drive.  Symptoms appear to be worsening.  In the meantime, he prescribed Ubrelvy to rule out migraines.  None of this appeared until after dose 2 of Pfizer.

                                                I also got the second Pfiszer-BioNTech shot on January 9th. On April 2nd, I was laying on the couch watching a movie and I had petechaie on my back from the couch. I also had it in a few spots on my chest. I did not have any bleeding. During my work shifts, I was fatigued during most of them that month. I saw my primary care doctor on April 29th and got labs drawn. The next day he called saying that my platelets were 5,000 and I did not have petechaie or bleeding at that time. Treatment has been 4 consecutive days of 40 mg of dexamethasone. My platelets dropped back to a similar level, so I was placed on prednisone 60 mg with a taper once I started 4 weekly Rituxamab treatments. I just finished those and my hematologist is recommending a spleenectomy at this time.

However, those symptoms subsided by Sunday, April 4th, 2021. Instead, I began to have very odd chest pains that I have never had before. I went to the ER and they believed it was due to me taking too much ibuprofen for my fever symptoms which would give me heart burn and said it could be a symptom from the vaccine. The night thereafter I woke up due to an earthquake and felt the chest pain only much worse. I immediately went to the ER again.

I slept for a long time and woke up the following day with the standard arm pain but I also had extreme fatigue and a headache as well as a productive cough. That lasted for over 48 hours. On the third day I had fatigue, cough, body aches and a headache. I received a rapid  covid test on the 31st that was negative and the nurse practitioner said that she believed that I was either having a bad reaction to the vaccine or bronchitis or pneumonia. Last night I had all of the same symptoms as days prior as well as tightness in my chest and a obvious upper respiratory infection.&#34;

                                                On December 16th, I received my 1st dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine at 11:49am. I was off of work for the remainder of the day and driving to an appointment at a different town. Between towns, during the drive fatigue settled in and I started to get drowsy. I switched seats and fell asleep for some time in the vehicle. I had fatigue for about 3-4 weeks following the 1st dose. On December 23rd, my symptoms started to get worse. Headaches increased, muscle pain/aches, chills, fatigue and this was the first day I had a temp of 100.4. I took some Tylenol and it made it bearable for me to continue to work throughout the day. From 12/20-26/2020, I kept feeling like I had a cold or the flu. Through the Holiday, I remained in bed and didn&#39;t have energy to do anything. I still had all the symptoms and decided on December 28th to call into work and get seen for a Telehealth. Some lab work were done and test results came back. I&#39;m still working with my provider on figuring out what&#39;s going on with me.

A 25-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation/ work. The patient has no medical history and concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020, the patient reported right after the first shot he had to wait 15 minutes for reaction-based purposes. Once he got to his car, the patient felt really really hot, and his throat started to itch described as was &#34;sandpapery&#34;. It wasn&#39;t horrible. It was not like anaphylactic. The patient took 2 antihistamine tablets (Benadryl), and it went away. He has had no AE since. The outcome of the events was recovered on 23Dec2020.

                                                I received the 2nd dose of my Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 01/25/2021 at ~7:30am, at around 2:00pm I noticed I had generalized fatigue, a general sense of feeling cold, and the muscles in the back of my neck were sore, which was causing a tension-like headache. The fatigue gradually increased throughout the day. I attempted to go to bed around 11:00pm and I was so cold my entire body was shivering to a point where my whole body was shaking. I also began noticing muscle cramps throughout my body as well, primarily located in my calves. Eventually fell asleep around 2:00am (symptoms were preventing me from falling asleep), when waking up noticed the symptoms had resolved.

Was about to leave and get on my motorcycle but a wave of dizziness hit, couldn&#39;t see (as if I had stood up too fast), started sweating profusely. Lasted for about 3 minutes. Man working brought me a bottle of water which I chugged, symptoms mostly passed a couple minutes later.  Was still dizzy for another 20 min but after that it passed.

He states he has not had a COVID infection to his knowledge, despite working on the COVID unit at the clinic. Member admits to nausea, fever, chills, hallucination,  and malaise. Denies HA, cp, sob, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, or LE swelling.   A/P: 1. Adverse effect of other viral vaccines, initial encounter Plan/Comment(s):  - 25 yo presents with what is likely a normal adverse reaction in a patient that has been exposed or infected by Coronavirus 19 in the past. He likely contracted the virus while working 2 months on the COVID ward at Clinic, which would be considered an asymptomatic infection. He denies having symptoms of COVID. While he did have an MMR booster the day before receiving the COVID vaccine dose #1, it was my opinion that because of his age and health status at the time of the screening, he was clear to receive the first dose of the COVID vaccine. I did consider possibility of cytokine storm, having been given two vaccines in such close intervals, but again he is young, healthy, and denied having COVID infection in the past,  and he did not exhibit any adverse reactions to the MMR booster.  I anticipate his condition will be self-limiting and the SM will return to full duty in 48 hours.   Reference:   11) Have you received any vaccine in the past 14 days or plan to receive any vaccine in the next 14 days? Currently there is no data on safety or efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine administered with other vaccines, however, the agency recommends that COVID-19 vaccines be administered alone with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration with any other vaccines. Vaccines required for post-exposure prophylaxis (e.g., rabies vaccine) may be administered within the 14-day period.   ***************Additionally, providers and patients can consider other vaccines, including the influenza vaccine, within the 14-day window on a case-by-case basis with shared clinical decision-making for Health Protection and other important co-administration vaccination needs.************  - will Rx Zofran - will Rx Tylenol - will Rx Motrin - SIQ  48 hours - Patient counseled on dx, tx, and plan; pt understands and concurs

Symptoms included headache, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, feeling feverish, and itching on torso, arms, and legs . Symptoms seemed to improve over the next week or two before worsening again on 3/27/21 around 10:00 am. On the day of 3/27 /21 I experienced headaches, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, muscle aches, diarrhea, and vision problems. Currently on 3/30/21 symptoms have improved but I am still experiencing dull headaches and brain fog, as well as itching on torso, arms and legs and some vision problems.   I have not seen a provider  for these issues but have an appointment scheduled for 3/31/21. Treatment includes ibuprofen as needed.

                                                I administered the vaccine to Jake and he sat down. About two minutes later, he slumped in his chair. My manager rushed to catch him from falling and I assisted in steadying him. He was breathing erratically, excessively diaphoretic, and his muscles were twitching frequently. His eyes were dilated and he became unresponsive. Fearing a seizure, we lowered him to the floor and turned him on his side. He became responsive and coherent again approximately one minute later and was speaking to us normally. Paramedics arrived several minutes later and took over care. He was taken to the hospital due to abnormal vital signs.

AT 5:45 PM WHILE PT WAS WAITING FOR HIS WAITING PERIOD TO BE OVER, HE BECAME VERY PALE, EYES DILATED, UNRESPONSIVE, AND VERY SWEATY. I ASKED FOR ONE OF MY COWORKERS TO CALL 911, WHILE I GOT THE EMERGENCY KIT OVER TO THE PTS SIDE. AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO 1 MIN, PT CAME TO, AND WE GAVE HIM WATER AND A COLD CLOTH. WE GOT HIM ON HIS BACK, AND KNEES BENT, WHILE WE WAITED FOR EMS. I TOOK HIS PULSE WHILE WAITING FOR EMS AND DID NOT NOTE ANY BRADYCARDIA OR TACHYCARDIA. EMS TOOK OVER CARE AND FINISHED EXAMINATION IN THE TRUCK. HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS WITH HIM AND SAID SHE WOULD DRIVE HIM HOME.

                                                Nurse at clinic incorrectly diluted a Pfizer vaccine vial with 0.8 ml of sodium chloride instead of 1.8 ml of sodium chloride and administered 0.3 ml to the patient. The patient experienced 104 degree fever with vomiting, dizziness and extreme muscle joint pain. We explained to him that we noticed the dose he was given had been diluted improperly and he had received a slightly higher than normal dose.   I apologized for the incident and he said ?it?s ok?, and that now he knew why he was so sick.  He was very pleasant and appreciative of us trying to contact him over the weekend.   He was encouraged to contact us with any questions or if any new symptoms arise.   We also offered to have one of our providers contact him to discuss further, but he declined.

I didn&#39;t notice any significant symptoms for about 11 hours following my 8:45am 2nd dose on the 26th. Then in the evening I started getting a fever, chills, soreness in the legs in addition to existing arm soreness. The fever got up to about 102 F I believe around 10-11pm, at which point I took 200 mg ibuprofen. I slept for most of the next day when possible, and the fever dropped to a bit above 100 F before rising slightly in the evening. Still had chills (shivering, teeth chattering). I took another 200 mg ibuprofen that evening. As of today (28th) the fever is gone and, besides a mild headache, I feel much better.

                                                We had a patient today that passed out after his covid vaccine.  It was his 2nd covid immunization.  He got his immunization at the pharmacy in the booth and then he sat down in one of the waiting chairs at the end of the cough and cold aisle.  While he was sitting down, he began to feel unwell, he then got up off his chair and then was approaching the drop off window (he was going to let us know he didn&#39;t feel well) at that time he then passed out.  He fell into the privacy screen of the imz booth.  He did fall into the booth which did break some of his fall.  He also knocked off one of the frames that we had on the wall, and then I think it fell on his nose.  He did get a cut nose and he also bit his lip or mouth because his mouth was bleeding also.  He reported that his nose did hurt, and he will have a prominent bruise on his nose.   We did provide him with a couple of ice packs and a bottle of water.   The patient (25 years old) and his mother both stated that he has passed out in the past when he has been around needles.  He stated that he got to thinking about getting the shot and the needle going into his arm and that is when he started to feel unwell.

                                                On Wednesday April 14th I got my second vaccination shot. The following day I had a 103 F fever, body aches, chills, migraine, sore muscles, couldn&#39;t walk, excessive thirst. Those effects lasted all day and I felt better on Friday. Saturday night chest pain started along with sore arm getting worse. I took ibuprofen and melatonin to sleep. Woke up Sunday morning and pain came back and gradually got worse until I went into the ER around 9 am. They gave me Morphine to put the chest pain at bay. Then transferred me by ambulance to a different hospital with a cariology department. They treated me as if it was Myocarditis and also got an x-ray of my chest. The next morning I had an MRI and that is what confirmed it to be Myocarditis. I was then discharged with lots of medications to keep the inflammation down.

I felt lightheaded and the shaking continued for about 20 minutes. During this time I checked my temp again and it was 105 degrees F. Once the shaking stopped the fever and intense pain continued until 2 am when it dropped down to 102 degrees F and I was able to fall asleep. The next morning I woke at 8am with a temp of 100 degree F with the same all-over-body pain that lasted all day but the fever dropped until that night. That night it came back at 100 degrees F.  This cycle lasted from when I got my shot on the 1st until 4th when the fever stopped. The pain has subsided around the 6th. But I am currently still having pain in my left shoulder where I got my shot today on the 8th.

The start was the lip and nose area and now it is all the way to the eye area (right half of my face). Did some reading and some said it could be due to facial fillers. I never had facial fillers before. Other side effects that came are the same as many have reported. Fever and chills day after taking. Fever lasted for two days. Chills are still happening at night.

                                                Beginning on the evening of Monday, May 10th, I began to feel a dull soreness in my chest, directly over the heart. I took an antacid believing it may be heartburn, but symptoms did not resolve. I scheduled a doctor&#39;s appointment for the next day as I felt something was definitely &#34;off&#34;.  The next afternoon I walked about 30 minutes to the clinic throughout relatively hilly terrain and did notice that I seemed a bit more tired than usual and felt my heart was working a bit harder, but it was hard to tell if it was just mental anxiety about the whole thing. I met with Dr. and an EKG was performed. The results indicated possible LAE and possible RV conduction delay.  Both him and a colleague didn&#39;t see much reason for concern, however. I scheduled an upcoming video visit with a cardiologist. The feeling continued, varying in intensity for the next week. On Wednesday, May 19th (2wks post 2nd dose, 9 days post symptom onset), I returned home from a motorcycle ride (something I mention as it often results in stress?still learning) and walked up to my third floor apartment. I noticed I was particularly stressed from the climb and my heart felt like it was working harder than usual, and consequently I felt the strongest pain since the initial onset. That pain lasted for a few hours until subsiding somewhat that evening, but was consistently present. The following day the pain had reduced significantly. It is now May 22nd and it&#39;s felt mostly normal all day, but is still definitely there. Feels worse when I get anxious or stressed. Heart rate as measured by my Apple Watch appears consistently normal aside from aforementioned stress or anxiety.

Stopped taking notes since. Doctor had me take a blood test (see below) as well as referred to a neurologist for an EMG.  5/4-5/26: I&#39;ve since been on some extra vitamins (b12 and d, as my b12 was on the low side but not outside the recommended range and d was also low) and have not seen any decrease or increase in symptoms. Some days are better than others. My right eye has stopped twitching, but I continue to have it throughout my body in my arms, back, legs, feet, left eye. I&#39;ve been on an average diet since the beginning of march.

I hope you stop misleading the public and communicate that myocarditis and severe inflammation IS 100% A SIDE EFFECT THAT IS CAUSED BY THE VACCINE RESPONSE. I know because I am experiencing it, and you&#39;ve ruined the last 24 days of my life. Thank you.

                                                Pt is a 25M with PMH of GERD, ADHD, obesity who presented to the ED on 5/11 for chest pain. That morning he had noticed increased substernal chest pressure associated with palpitations, nausea, diaphoresis, and left arm tingling. He notes that early last year he was very sick and though he had COVID but confirmatory testing was not available at that time. After recovering from the illness he noted that he had occasionally episodes of chest pressure and palpitations. However yesterday was the worst his symptoms have ever been. He did receive his 2nd COVID vaccine this past Saturday and experienced fatigue, nausea, weakness.  In the ED patient has HD stable, afebrile, saturating well on RA. Labs were notable for troponin of 5.2 which trend down to 3.1. ESR WNL, CRP elevated 2.4. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with signs suggestive of possible pericarditis. CXR negative. CTA showed no pulmonary embolism, enlarged and prominent left axillary lymph nodes, nonspecific, cholelithiasis. Patient admitted for NSTEMI. Enlarged axillary lymph nodes likely reactive in the setting of recent COVID vaccine.    Cardiology consulted. Patient underwent cardiac cath which was unremarkable. Cardiology recommends short course NSAIDs for possible pericarditis, however EKG changes unimpressive per cardiology. Discharged home on ibuprofen 400 mg TID for 5 days. Advise follow up with PCP within 1 week.

                                                Patient developed sudden onset of fevers and malaise on 5/7/21 (26 days after his 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine).  His symptoms progressed to involve shortness of breath which prompted his admission to our Hospital on 5/12/21.  He rapidly deteriorated requiring intubation and ultimately placement on ECMO and temporary internal heart pump (Impella device) placement.  He was thought to have myocarditis due to elevated troponins at the time of admission and cardiac MRI showing wide spread myocardial inflammation suggestive of myocarditis.   He was treated with high dose steroids and supportive care due to the concern for cytokine storm and eventually started to show signs of improvement.   He was eventually taken off ECMO, internal heart pump and ventilatory support and went home after 20 days in the hospital.  However, follow up cardiac MRI revealed ongoing myocarditis, but his ejection fraction had improved.

They told him was throat was closing up.; Anaphylaxis/anaphylactic shock/severe allergic reaction; Swelling of the throat/throat was swelling; Trouble breathing; Itchy throat; Said that his throat felt really thirsty.; He is very upset./He is pretty devastated.; His throat started to do it again.; They said maybe it was something he ate or maybe sinuses; This is spontaneous report from contactable consumer (patient) and contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 25-year-old male patient received the first dose for BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot No. EWO187) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization on 19May2021 at 12:00 or 13:00. Relevant history included Diabetes, obesity, endocrine abnormalities, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, respiratory illness, compromised immune status and Allergies. The patient had Allergies to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can induce anaphylactic shock, severe reaction, swelling of face and throat. Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Additional Vaccines were Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect If applicable. No Vaccines were Administered prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Family Medical History was none. About 3-5 minutes after being administered the Vaccine, the patient immediately developed anaphylactic shock. He was transported via ambulance to the Emergency Room on 19May2021 where he verified he was admitted to the hospital Emergency room for about 5-6 hours and discharged from the hospital the same day, 19May2021. He was told not to get any additional doses.  He was still having swelling of the throat and went back to the ER today and was given a steroid prednisone 40mg a day for 5 days.  He was advised to take benadryl also.  He said he didn&#39;t get any IVs or anything.  He had a past medical history of anaphylactic reaction to NSAIDS.  He has been advised not to get the second dose. The patient stated the anaphylactic shock occurred with trouble breathing, throat was swelling and itchy throat. He did go into ER, they told him to just keep drinking fluids, that there was nothing else they could really do. When he was seen in the emergency room they gave him Benadryl and a steroid: Prednisone for now which he is on for the next couple of days. He was told that after 2 days or something, that after getting injected that he wouldn&#39;t have any symptoms-but he is still having those pretty severe symptoms of anaphylactic shock. Initial onset of anaphylactic shock was about 3-5 minutes after Pfizer Covid Vaccine shot was administered. Within 10-15 minutes he had swelling of tongue and throat and difficulty breathing. They called an ambulance, the ambulance took him to the Hospital emergency room where he was admitted and discharged that same date on 19May2021 after about 5-6 hours; he reported discharge time was around 16:40. They told him to come back if he had any issues that occurred over next couple of days or worsening or causing problems; to call back the nurses line. He was on a lot of Benadryl, a lot of antihistamines. When he gets off the antihistamines almost all the allergic reactions of the anaphylactic shock reoccur. This morning, 21May2021, he didn&#39;t take any Bendaryl before bed, and this morning when he woke up he was alright. After being at work like 30 minutes he felt the itchiness; scratchy throat; swelling of tongue; a little swelling of the throat; difficulty breathing. He took Benadryl and called the hotline who told him to call the Emergency room, he called the emergency room and went there. He talked to them this morning because he went to work and had issues breathing. He called and they told him to come in asap, so he went in to the emergency room; they gave him Benadryl and told him there was nothing else they could do other than him taking the steroid: Prednisone. The patient was in the hospital 3 days and will be day 4 tomorrow. He was trying to figure out how long this will last. They told him to talk to his doctor. They basically told him they were not responsible. The patient&#39;s mother reported that her son received the shot Wed 19May2021. Does not know if the Walgreen&#39;s reported this. He left there in an ambulance within 10 minutes of getting the shot. They took him to the emergency room and he got mixed information. He went back again today. They blew him off and told him maybe it was something he ate. She assumed that an allergic reaction would be about 24 hours but this is day 3. She is scared he may be taking too much Benadryl. He said he felt like he needed something to drink. Said that his throat felt really thirsty. He went back inside since his throat fell really tight. They told him was throat was closing up. They saw that his throat was swollen and they called the paramedics. Within 15 minutes they came and brought him to the emergency room.  Nobody had given him Epi. They were going to give it to him an Epi pen  but he wanted to wait for the paramedics. He was freaking out. The paramedics showed up and they were unable to give him Epi, stating he didn&#39;t have hives. He only received Benadryl. They he had to have to give him extra Benadryl because whatever they gave him in the IV because the first didn&#39;t work and his throat was still closing up. It made him feel like a drug addict asking for Benadryl.  She was not sure if they gave him Benadryl in the ambulance, knows that it was given in the emergency room. The Benadryl may have been started in the ambulance but she is not sure. They did give him oxygen in the ambulance. Clarified he was in the ER over 4 hours, but was not admitted to the hospital. They gave him steroids but forgot to send him home with steroids. He had to call to find out about getting them and they told him they forgot to send the prescription in. He was late starting the next dose of steroids. He went back to the ER today, day 3. He didn&#39;t feel too bad today and went to work. After exerting a little energy and moving around, his throat started to do it again. He didn&#39;t have Benadryl on him. He left work because he thought it was going to close up again the day he got the shot. Once he calmed down, he took Benadryl. He called the hospital to ask if this was  normal. He was told that it is not normal and was told that if he still felt bad, to come to the hospital. They said maybe it was something he ate or maybe sinuses. He spoke to one of the doctors. They had never shown him how to use an ePi pen. He does not know how long this will last. He gets scared. Treatment: Has only been taking Benadryl. He started the steroids yesterday and today. They had given him Benadryl today in the ER and he is home now. The patient visited to the Emergency room twice, first time by ambulance, confirmed he was not admitted. He was pretty devastated. The outcome of events was unknown.

After about a week, COVID fog/fatigue symptoms began.  It is currently 6 weeks later and I have fatigue, shortness of breath, head pressure, double vision, cannot concentrate for any length of time and dizziness/unsteadiness.  I have not been able to go to work since the vaccination and have people helping take care of me.  I cannot take a shower without being short of breath after.  I have been put on 2 different rounds of steroids ? the 2nd more aggressive, which did not make a difference.  I have been to my general doctor several times, an allergist and a neurologist.  I have had extensive bloodwork, an MRI, and an EKG ? all were normal.  My symptoms have not improved at all in the past 3-4 weeks.

                                                Over a month after receiving my second dose of Pfizer, I had an episode of lightheadedness, dizziness, shakiness, and fatigue. I attributed it to dehydration and laid down and ate a snack, I began to feel better after 1-2 hours. A week later I had another lightheadedness incident that sent me back to bed (this one being slightly worse). I experience slight chest pain in my upper right chest muscle. It took me a day to recover from this spell. I constantly felt weak and as if I was about to faint. I went to the doctor two days later and got blood work done and measured my blood pressure. Everything came back normal. On Saturday June 19th, I had another near-fainting experience in a public setting. My hearing changed, I couldn&#39;t think straight, I was very shaky and weak, and I tried to drink a lot of water. Nothing helped so I went home and once I got in bed I was aggressively shaking. Since then I have been bed-ridden for the week, and unable to do normal activities such as go for walks, exercise, or go to work. I am going to visit a cardiologist tomorrow.
