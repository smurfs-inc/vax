His mother gently lowered him to the ground (@ 1804). Patient&#39;s mother stated he just passed out and that this was his first injection ever in his life. Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient&#39;s legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling &#34;a star&#34; on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%. Immediately after the patient passed out the second time, his pulse was measured at 38 bpm and his lips displayed slight cyanosis. His pulse quickly rose to 52 bpm, within less than 10 seconds. One minute later his pulse was up to 68 bpm.

                                                High blood sugars for a week now.  My son is 16 year&#39;s old and was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in November.  He is thin and active, and an otherwise healthy teen and runner.  He is in his &#34;honeymoon phase&#34; of diabetes and I think the vaccine may be killing off beta cells.  He went from having blood sugar levels in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s at 12 units of Lantus to now 120&#39;s to 130&#39;s and up to 160&#39;s immediately after the shot.  His mealtime insulin is also not working at the same number of units and he&#39;s going in the 200&#39;s when he was around 160&#39;s before the shot. It has lasted now for a week instead of the 48 hours I was told about and read about.   As soon as we were leaving from getting his vaccine, he started experiencing extreme fatigue.  That night and for 2 days he had a headache.  He is still more tired than usual and having to take naps.

A 16-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 16Apr2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 16-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mental illness and autism from unspecified dates and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2, administered in right arm on Mar2021 (Lot number was unknown), at the age of 16 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no other vaccines in four weeks. Several hours after receiving the second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 16Apr2021 20:00, the individual developed a headache and took ibuprofen (ADVIL) and water. About an hour later, he was disoriented and the parent (who was a nurse practitioner) asked him questions and he was having a hard time answering. Patient&#39;s fever was over 103 in the ambulance. He was tested for everything at the hospital and all was negative. It was determined to be an adverse reaction to the vaccine and what likely happened is his temperature spiked so quickly that he had a seizure. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment for other adverse events was unknown. There was no COVID prior vaccination and patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about lot/batch has been requested.

Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation. Family Medical History included Sarcoidosis with mother. Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation.

He has several different types of seizures but he has what are called mini seizures, the blank stare, the confusion. Nothing has stopped completely, he isn&#39;t back to his baseline as far as his seizures. He always has seizures, daily so she is calling about the increased activity and when she says his baseline she means he has not returned back to his baseline activity, but he is doing better than yesterday.

                                                This is a 18 y.o. male who is generally healthy. He received a second dose of the SARS2-COV vaccine on 3/4. The following morning he felt feverish and achy with malaise. He stayed home, drank fluids and rested and felt well enough to come up to ski this weekend. During skiing he had some anterior chest pain, it resolved and he went about his day. Tonight at 2245 the pain became sharp and awakened him from sleep. He felt nauseated and clammy as well. Father brought him to the ER for evaluation. His emergency department evaluation showed ST elevations most notably in the inferior and lateral leads as well as in the lateral precordium.

Patient&#39;s fever continued to hover around 101 to 102 Saturday and Sunday. There were times, within an hour of taking Tylenol that it might drop to 99, but would go right back up.  He continued to experience fatigue, chills, etc... His fever finally broke on Monday morning and he is still experiencing some lymphadenopathy, but the lymph nodes are starting to reduce s of 3/17/21.

                                                Patient was nervous about getting vaccine. Discussed safety profile of vaccine and that many people are tolerating very well. Patient seemed much better after discussion and was ready to get vaccine.  Gave injection and he was doing fine and went to sit down for 30 minutes as recommended. After giving next vaccine about 15 minutes later patient apparently tried to come across waiting room to speak to me and started to fall. Next patient was leaving room and caught patient, preventing injury and called for help.  Multiple staff responded.  Patient reported dizziness and seeing colors.  Was breathing fast but not having any swelling or trouble breathing. Was able to stand after a minute and was taken to clinic that is right next to pharmacy for evaluation. Patient was evaluated and left within the next hour doing well.  Spoke to patient in the afternoon and reports recovering well, has a headache that he thinks is stress related.  Counseled to continue to monitor and seek medical attention if any worsening of symptoms.

Further testing for hepatitis was negative.  Was sent to the ER the following day as we were unable to get blood drawn and GI consult was desired.  There he had a normal abdominal US and bilirubin had dropped and he has since been followed by GI and is currently being evaluated by Hematology for any underlying conditions that may be contributing.

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Apr2021 at 12:45 (Lot Number: Ew0153) at the age of 18 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included autism spectrum disorder, ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) combined, learning disabilities. The patient had no known allergies. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medication taken within two weeks of vaccination included alfetamine aspartate/alfetamine sulfate/dexamphetamine saccharate/dexamphetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for an unspecified indication. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 in left arm, on 02Apr2021, lot # EK5730. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Apr2021 at 21:00 the patient experienced extreme hallucinations, not feeling well, chills, aches and pains, headaches, slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, he did not get much sleep, fever. The clinical course of events was reported as follows: My son reported to me at bedtime last night, the night of his second Pfizer vaccine dose, that he was not feeling well. I told him to take some Advil and go to bed. He had a very bad night with chills and aches and pains but most distressing was his description of having had extreme hallucinations. He said that he was aware they were hallucinations and not real during and after the experience, but it was nonetheless concerning. It is also concerning that he didn&#39;t wake me for help. At any rate, he did not get much sleep and I have to assume his fever went pretty high before morning. He described to me the need to hydrate during the night. He also relayed to me this morning an experience of headaches and slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, but he is now feeling much better. He is dressed, has eaten, and is playing games on the computer. I am keeping a close eye on him today and should we return to that level of concern, we will take him to urgent care.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

                                                A little before bed I was feeling cold (I think it was a little after 10pm). I took a warm shower thinking the house was just cold, but when I went to bed after I started shaking with chills. I didn?t sleep well that night and during the day Thursday (01/21) I felt feverish and a throbbing headache. I tried sleeping throughout the day, still having the chills come and go. I took ibuprofen before heading the bed the next night and slept great other than feeling a little hot and sweaty. I showered the next morning and felt 100% again.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

On the day prior to arrival he developed increasing shortness of breath particularly with talking and with ambulation.  He also describes chest tightness with deep inspiration, the tightness radiates to back, no radiation to left arm or jaw.  Chest tightness is non-positional, but does feel worse immediately after he lies down from ambulation and then slowly dissipates.  His last subjective fever was yesterday evening.  He has never had a reaction to the vaccine before.  He has no allergies.  No prior medical conditions he is aware of, and takes no medications.  He did not experience any of the symptoms following the first vaccine. He has h/o asymptomatic COVID infection in November 2020. Cardiology consulted for concern of pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccine. He does not have significant ST elevation or PR depression.  He also does not have evidence of significant pericardial effusion at this point.  The high sensitivity troponins are mildly elevated.  He does have viral syndrome.  Is unclear if Covid vaccination was causally related to his symptoms.  We would like to improve his medications for better chest pain control and to prevent recurrent pericarditis in the future.

A 19-years-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) lot number: ER 8727, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 03Apr2021 18:00 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma. There were no concomitant medications. On 04Apr2021, the patient experienced headache, lethargy, temperature 102.6, hard swollen lymph node right axilla. On 05Apr2021, signs and symptoms persisted with addition of nausea. On 06Apr2021, the patient experienced chest tightness/pain and shortness of breath. The patient went to ER on an unspecified date in 2021 with elevated troponin peaked at 9.6 hence heparin drip was started. The patient was admitted to hospital. On 09Apr2021, the patient was discharged with diagnosis of myocarditis. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The vaccine was administered to the writer at 0800 on 1/5/2021. No immediate reactions were noticed for the 30 minutes observation period immediately after. The writer&#39;s muscle that received the vaccine began to become increasingly sore throughout the day; however, that was similar to the first dose of the same vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain was described as constant (2/10) but aggravated with motion. The pain did interfere with the writer&#39;s normal range of motion (specifically raising the writer&#39;s arm above shoulder height). From 0800-2200 on 1/5/2021 no noticeable symptoms except for the injection site pain occurred.   At 2200, the writer rapidly developed chills, body aches, a headache, fatigue, and a fever of 100.8. These symptoms were left untreated and continued through the night (the symptoms did not interfere with sleep). The writer woke up at 1300 on 1/6/2021; all previous symptoms had resolved by this time except for the injection site pain. By 1400 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed pain near the right axillary lymph nodes. The pain can be described as moderate (1/10) and generally occurred only with motion. The writer was unable to palpate any swelling in the area. Around 1800 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed it felt weird to swallow. Specifically, it felt as if there was a slight internal swelling 1-inch subhyoidally and 1-2 inches laterally within the right side of his neck when he swallowed. The swelling was not palpable from the skin&#39;s surface. The writer did not seek medical attention as breathing/eating/drinking were not made more difficult but monitored this closely. The swelling in the neck resolved by 2000 on 1/6/2021. The lymph node pain in the right arm resolved over the course of a few days and was no longer present by 1/9/2021 at 1300.

Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

This 20-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number ER8731) on 14Apr2021 16:45 at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number ER8733) on 28Mar2021 12:00 in right arm. The patient had no Known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no COVID tested post vaccination. The patient had not received other vaccine in four weeks. On 15Apr2021 04:00, his body was involuntarily twitching and his teeth was opening and closing as if he was having a seizure. He thought it was because he was cold so he put on 3 layers of clothes and 2 bundles of blankets and turned the heat up, but his body was still shaking and he was still cold. He tried to go back to sleep to see if that would fix it, but it did not until he went to work and around 7:30 a.m., the shivering stopped, but the headaches persisted and he had to ask to go home and he received an occurrence because he did not have a doctor&#39;s note. He clocked out at 8 and he went to sleep for an hour in the car in the parking lot because he was in no condition to drive home. Treatment received for the events included Acetaminophen and rest. The outcome of teeth was opening and closing as if I was having a seizure, body was involuntarily twitching, was cold, shaking, was resolving. The outcome of shivering was resolved. The outcome of headaches was not resolved.

Began with severe full body chills and full body muscle shaking and weakness during the night of 1/5 and early morning of 1/6, around 1000 to 0200. Slight headache began during that time as well.   Upon waking at 0900 on 1/6, chills and shaking decreased to mild severity, muscles still felt moderately weak and shaky, headache had increased in severity to a severe throbbing pain that worsened upon standing and walking, and moderate visual photosensitivity began. The headache persisted until I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen 200 mg, which is when the severity decreased to moderate after a few hours and then mild by bedtime. The photosensitivity persisted through the day and did not decrease much by bedtime.   Upon waking 1/7, there was only a mild headache and mild photosensitivity that faded completely within a few hours, no medication required. No more symptoms in the afternoon.

                                                Patient developed typical fever, myalgias, body aches in the days after his vaccine.  He would describe them as severe.  This was followed by chest pains.  These chest pains prompted him to seek care in the ER.  Upon workup, I found the patient to have developed myocarditis with a significantly elevated troponin prompting hospitalization.

However, I started feeling very lightheaded and felt like my hearing wasn&#39;t as good for up to ten minutes after the onset of symptoms. About 15 minutes later and having a piece of candy along with some water, I felt much better and was able to drive home and go about the rest of my day.

                                                ED Visit 3/11/21 History of Present Illness 21 year old man pmhx of autism, recurrent abscesses, presents with complaint of L axilla swelling and drainage. Pt received COVID vaccine in L arm on 3/1. Pt did well until 3/5 when he started to complain of pain in the L armpit. Mother examined the area and did not see anything concerning. The pain continued through the weekend, no fevers. Pt felt warm on Monday, no temperature taken. Mother then noted a few &#34;bump&#34; near the L armpit. The bumps continued to swell and be painful on Tuesday, went to pediatrician and was prescribed Keflex. Pt has been taking Keflex but continues to spike fevers, Tmax 102F on Wednesday. Pt had fevers yesterday and today of &#34;about 100.&#34; Pt took a nap today, and woke up with the area draining. Mother states that the drainage was smelly pus. Called PCP who recommended evaluation. ED course: Patient observed in the emergency department of antipyretics and did not have any further fever.  I will switch his treatment to clindamycin and provide topical bacitracin and provide strict criteria to come back if pt became febrile instructions provided to mom.   Patient safe for discharge to home. Discharged in improved condition. Written instructions reviewed with family.  3/18/2021 Discharge Summary History of Present Illness 21yo man with h/o autism and multiple soft tissue infections including cellulitis and pilonidal cyst who presented to the ED 3/13/2021 after axillary drainage and fever.  He had been treated outpatient with keflex, but continued to have fevers at home. Re-evaluated at ED and placed on clindamycin. Cultures from outpatient showing skin flora. Mother has been doing several dressings of drainage at home and ongoing fevers up to 102 so was brought to the ED for evaluation. No cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, recent travel, known sick contacts.  Summary of hospitalization: He re-presented to ED on 3/13/2021 and was started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. A CT scan with contrast done to determine extension of abscess, which was fortunately limited to the subcutaneous plane (no infiltration near bone or into muscle fascia). In the ED, patient&#39;s creatinine was 1.5. Patient received IVF and his creatinine downtrended to 0.75 on 3/18/21.   The surgical course was uneventful. Successful debridement of the left axillary abscess was performed on 03/4/21. Wound cultures grew Actinomyces Europaeus and S. Epidermidis and Infectious Disease was consulted. Their antibiotic recommendations to discontinue the cefepime/flagyl and start vanc/CTX were followed. Sensitivity analyses showed S. Epidermidis was sensitive to linezolid, tetracyclin, tigecyclin, bactruim and vancomycin. The Actinomyces Europaeus sensitivities have not yet resulted at time of discharge. Per ID recommendations, the vanc and CTX were discontinued and oral doxycycline was started, which should be continued for 6 months. It could be considered to switch to PO amoxicillin after 2 weeks and finish the 6 month course with amoxicillin. This will be discussed during outpatient follow-up. Per ID recommendations, the following labs should be checked 2 weeks after discharge (on 3/29/21) and could be spaced out to every 4 weeks thereafter if normal: CBC with differential, CRP, ESR, BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT.  The patient is scheduled to see (ID) on 5/5/21. Dermatology was consulted per ID recs for evaluation of spots on the chest and back. Per dermatology these spots are keloid, not suspicious for hidradenitis suppurative, there is no need for biopsy. For pilonidal cyst spot dermatology recommends rec hibicleans cream. Immunology was consulted for recurring abscesses and recommended the following tests, which were ordered, in addition to outpatient followup: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, specific Ab titers: for strep pneumo IgG (23 serotypes) and tetanus IgG, lymphocyte subsets, T cell memory panel, B cell memory panel, neutrophil DHR, CH50.  A wound VAC was placed on the left axillary wound bed on 03/15/21 and exchanged on 3/17/21.  Patient tolerated the wound vac changes well with 5mg of oxycodone taken 1 hour prior to the vac change. On 03/18/21 patient was discharged with a home wound vac and VNA.  At the time of discharged patient was afebrile, his pain was well controlled, his oxygen saturations were &gt;94% on room air, he was tolerating a regular diet and voiding/stooling without issues.

A 22-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot: EK5730) intramuscularly in left arm on 21Dec2020 (15:00-16:00) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received first dose of vaccine 21Dec2020 and SARS-Cov-2 positive 06Jan2021 13:00. The patient got COVID vaccine 21Dec2020, and was scheduled to get second dose on 11Jan2021. He had a sniffle the other day on 05Jan2021 night time and tested positive for COVID on 06Jan2021, so reporter wanted to know if he should still get second dose. His symptoms are stable. He is quarantining. He is on his way to do a PCR now. Reporter read somewhere people could have false positive in nasal. He is losing some taste from 07Jan2021 (01:00 - 02:00). Most things he can taste. Some he cannot. It is not completely gone but reduced by 30-40%. He did a mouthwash with a sting and is not feeling that sting anymore. He said last night, same thing. He did a mouth wash and did not really taste much. It is not as prevalent as it was before. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test: positive on 06Jan2021, positive COVID test 06Jan2021, 13:00, Nasal swab COVID. Event outcome of sniffles was recovering, while for other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The efficacy of a drug varies from one patient to another and can be affected by different factors; however, a contributory role of the suspect drug BNT162B2 to the reported event ___ cannot be ruled out. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I started feeling achy around 9:00 pm and felt like I was going to get more ill. I took some Tylenol in hopes it would help but it got worse throughout the night. During the night, I couldn?t hardly sleep due to feeling really hot and achy. I felt like I had a fever but did not have a thermometer to check it. When I woke up this morning, I noticed I had a knot on my clavicle which I believe it to be a swollen supraclavicular lymph node. I was unable to go to my internship today due to feeling ill but I am feeling better now after sleep and medication.

                                                At around 10 pm. I started feeling really cold. By 10:30 I had really bad chills. I tried to lay down and warm up but by chills were extreme by the time I got in bed. They were so bad that I couldn&#39;t even hold my phone or drink water without extra effort. Then as I tried to sleep I started to feel really hot. I eventually went to sleep but woke up about two hours later feeling like I had a fever. I was hot and sweaty. During the night I woke up every two hours feeling this way, hot, and tired. Then at 6 am I woke up still feeling bad, but better. Now I had a headache that wasn&#39;t there before. I drank a lot of water and took advil. After a cold shower I started to feel a lot better.

                                                The patient was given the vaccine at 1:50pm. He was fine immediately afterward. He was sent outside the clinical room to wait his 15 minutes. When the pharmacist went to release him, he was pale, dizzy, and clammy. He stated that he did not feel good. The pharmacist fanned him to cool  him down. She also gave him a wet rag to wipe his forehead. He was given two teaspoonful of Benadryl 12.5mg/ 5ml. The patient stated that he was feeling dizzy and thought he was going to faint. The pharmacy called 911. The patient removed his jacket and mask as he was hot. The EMT arrived and walked him outside* I am not sure what happened after that

                                                Around 10pm, I was suddenly very tired and could not stop yawning. I typically am up until 12-1 most nights so this was out of the ordinary. While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

A 22-years-old male patient (Son) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. My son is having a tough time with the vaccine. Everyday he has a couple of side effects. He started with body ache and tiredness on unspecified date Apr2021. He had a pounding headache. His headache was moderate today. However, the headache symptoms are getting worst. Generally, the symptoms last a day his have been getting worst for 7 days. He has been taking Tylenol and Advil. But the Advil doesn&#39;t even seem to hep anymore.&#34; headache is a common side effect reported with the vaccine. If the symptoms persists or get worst please consult your HCP. Please note blood clot has not been associated with the vaccine. Patient is been experiencing what I considered to be pretty severe, I guess reaction in term of aches and headache. This morning he woke up with the pounding headache, he kid described it as pounding and I just I guess I want to ask because everywhere I read, it says mild headaches are common and aches and I understand that but I guess understanding why this, this is considered somewhat as severe reaction or is there anything he can do to alleviate the symptom and should he, I guess my question is actually I guess my question also is should he not possibly get the second dose if he is experiencing such bad headaches with the first dose. When paraphrased the concern, reporter stated, Yes, basically we are thinking if can do to alleviate it and then he could not get the second dose, if you have any advice, I guess and just let you know he went to his health center in the college he went to get a COVID test and a flu test just to make sure he doesn&#39;t have actual Covid or flu and those report I got yesterday and so they told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. When probed for event start date, reporter stated, I would say a day after, I would say 09Apr2021, I guess it&#39;s phantom (not clarified) with symptom, the first day he was just tired, as far as the headache that started on the 09Apr2021. He (son) also passed out after the vaccine, which I also did that I didn&#39;t have Pfizer I (reporter) had Moderna and I had that same reaction, so I think that sometimes happens to some people but that&#39;s it happens also. When probed for vaccination anatomical site, reporter stated, Outside of the body I guess, I don&#39;t know that for sure. Patient still having the problem (event), and out event outcome, reporter stated, Yes, I think persisting, I think it varies. Patient has been taking Advil (Ibuprofen) and Tylenol (treatment). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included influenza virus test: negative on 12Apr2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 12Apr2021. They told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of body ache (pain), tiredness (fatigue), pounding headache/headache symptoms are getting worst (headache). The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  QR Comment: Call handler not filed split case. Might have been split case.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I had injection site pain about 4 or 5 hours after my injection. Around 9:15 at night I felt slightly warm and could tell that I was becoming febrile, but I wasn&#39;t completely there yet. Around 12:45AM on January 9th, I had massive chills and uncontrollable shivering and muscle aches. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen at 6:00AM when my chills came back. At 10:45AM I was feeling febrile again, and took 600 mg of ibuprofen followed by an hour and a half nap. I had slight malaise afterwards but did not feel febrile. By 5PM, I was feeling almost completely normal and was fever free. On the morning of 1/10, I am completely recovered.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The day after the injection, in the afternoon (so about 36 hours after the injection of the second dose), I started to develop slight chills and fatigue, but no fever. This was accompanied by a mass that developed under my right armpit, about 4-5 cm in diameter and bulging out to the point that I felt it touching my upper arm before I even saw it in a mirror. It was not red, and it was malleable with a small, hard nodule in the center. I used an ice compression and some ibuprofen over a few days, and it has receded about 95% of the way, almost back to normal.

A 23-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number and expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 20Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (3 weeks ago, thinks it was 05Jan2021) for COVID-19 immunization. The reporter stated that her son worked in a doctor&#39;s office and got the second COVID 19 vaccine on 20Jan2021. Her son has a fever (started about 4PM) and she wanted to know if her son was contagious because he has a fever. He was experiencing quite a few side effects: headache and fever on 21Jan2021; and on 20Jan2021 chills and he started last night with pain under the arm. Outcome of the events pain under the arm and headache was not recovered, fever and chills were recovering.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

I just need some sugar like juice.&#34; He denied difficulty breathing or chest pain. He was not nauseous nor did he vomit. I transported him to a private holding room via wheelchair and gave him a 12 oz can of Coca-Cola. He took sips and immediately reported feeling better. The initial vital signs I took were as follows: Temp 98.6 F, HR 67, BP 84/48 mmHg, RR 24/min, and SpO2 97%.  After recheck in 15 min BP improved to 106/62 mmHg, his became more pink and no more diaphoresis. I observed him for 30 minutes total and he was stable to go home. He drove himself home.

Body fatigue, temperature varying from low 99 F up to 101.3 F. These symptoms subsided after about 2 days. Also developing during this time was an asthma attack, characterized by wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Patient has had life-long history of asthma, moderate, well-maintained with albuterol inhaler (life-long) and Qvar redihaler (beginning in early-mid 2020). However, after the common symptoms subsided, the asthma attack prolonged for over a week (2nd injection on 22 Apr 2021, and present as of reporting (03 May 2021). Albuterol inhaler would ease the wheezing, but no effect on mitigating the coughing / difficulty breathing. Qvar redihaler had no effect. Asthma attack would alternate in waves (approximately every hour up to 4-6 hour cycles), of breathing mostly clearly (some difficulty persisting), and severe attacks when extremely difficult to breathe.

                                                Hives appearing on chest/thighs/back after 30-48hrs, progressing on the 2nd day rapidly across whole body. Itchy and red. Went to urgent care evening of 2nd day, received 50mg diphenhydramine that suppressed itching enough to sleep. Woke up itching and red at 6am of 3rd day, took 25mg diphenhydramine. Took 40mg prednisone at 8am. Went to urgent care at 10am for worsening hives, spreading and covering torso and onto face. Received dexamethasone injection into glute and prednisone prescription was upped to 50mg daily for the next week.  Took OTC Zyrtec and Pepcid once following the second urgent care visit. Hives responded well after 2hrs post visit, assuming due to prednisone and dexamethasone. Day 4 (1/12/20) woke up with widespread hives that became further inflamed until an hour after prednisone taken with breakfast. Also woke up with slight sore throat and wheezing, both of which subsided. Currently scheduled to see an allergist on 1/13/20. No known allergies and no other known introduction of allergens in the past week.

I waited for 30 minutes and was perfectly fine.  Around 5 pm I started to feel symptoms.  I got the worst aches in my entire body i&#39;ve ever felt before, along with chills.  I felt extremely hot, I took my temperature and had a fever of 102.3.  I felt dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseas .  My head was throbbing.  I ended up taking 1000mg of tylenol to help reduce the fever, which seemed to really help.  I fell asleep and woke up the next morning drenched in sweat.  My fever was gone, but I still had a horrible headache and threw up from the nausea I was having.  It felt like I had a horrible hangover.

My large joints (e.g., hips, knees, elbows, shoulders) started to develops aches/discomfort. A hot shower helped relieve the initial discomfort, and I took 1g of APAP ~45 minutes after waking up. I then reported to work, which is an ambulatory care clinic that is working a drive-up clinic. As such, I had to work outside in ~20F weather. I had 4 layers on my upper body and 2 layers on lower body with wool socks. The cold did not bother me for the first two hours as I was able to return to a warm area between patients; however, as work became busy, I spent more time outside. The aches/discomfort in my joints progressively worsened as well as the general bodily fatigue. I took another 500mg of APAP, but it did not help much more. Eventually, the cold and body fatigue made breathing uncomfortable, and my breathing became slightly labored. Returning to the warm environment helped the symptoms not get worse, but focusing on tasks became slightly difficult. I returned home at approximately 1630, took another 1g of APAP, and proceeded to sleep from ~1730 until 0530 the next morning. I woke up feeling much better.

                                                On Friday morning 2/26/21, we had a 24 yo male patient who had an anaphylactic reaction after his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He was instructed to wait on the chair, but had stood up at some point but was still in the pharmacy waiting area. A team member noticed he had fainted and called for help. The pharmacist on duty and immunizing tech came immediately to help him to a chair. At that point, he was conscious and talking. Then within a few seconds he started convulsing on the chair and lost consciousness. His eyes were open and head tilted back. A team member immediately called 911 and pharmacist administered 0.3mg Epipen to the thigh. We removed his face mask to check his breathing and also to allow him to breathe more easily. We also adjusted his head more forward and he started coughing. After about 15 seconds, he regained consciousness and could answer questions. EMT arrived soon after and took over. Patient does not have allergies or any history of anaphylaxis/ severe reaction from vaccinations. He did express some fear of needles and did not eat breakfast yet.

                                                Minutes after receiving my vaccine my left arm began to go numb with a full head headache following soon after. I was then moved to the observation area where my chest got tight, I had difficulty breathing and my temperature fluctuated which made me shake. When hives began to show on my face, neck and ears the on-site medical staff gave me a shot of epinephrine and Benadryl and put me on oxygen, during this time an ambulance was called by the staff. When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

Around 6am I measured my axillary temperature to be 100.9 F and took 650 Tylenol once which broke the fever. I was unable to go in to work that day. Now, two days after the vaccine, my other symptoms have resolved aside from a painful, and visibly noticable, lymph adenopathy in my left arm pit the same side as the vaccine.

I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

                                                platelets completely crashed; arm got a little sore; felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms; felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (reporting on himself). A 24-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection, lot number: SH1555218 and expiration date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 21Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing 22Q (diagnosed with this condition when he was about 4 years old). Immunodeficiency from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included rituximab (RITUXAN) taken for immunodeficiency, start and stop date were not reported. Patient states he received the 1st dose on 21Mar2021 about 9:00am or a little before that time and had a very bad side effect and was in the hospital for a couple of days. His weight was 162 or 163 pounds. Patient was immunocompromised and has issues regarding that lately and received Rituximab which is like a chemo; states after he had the Pfizer Vaccine on 21Mar2021, his arm that the vaccine was administered into got a little sore relatively soon after the shot and the main thing he was reporting that his platelets completely crashed which was the reason for the hospitalization (from 24Mar2021 to 26Mar2021). Patient states for the Rituximab he gets due to having some issues being immunocompromised, it was his 4th treatment with the Rituximab and states he has no lot numbers, dosages, expiry dates or NDC numbers to provide and states he was on the Rituximab for his immunocompromised status. His arm soreness was in the same arm that he had the Pfizer vaccine administered into and would say the following day after getting the Pfizer vaccine, he felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms that resolved completely like 2 days later and these symptoms went away. Patient was immunocompromised and has fairly serious health issues since he was age 4-5 and was able to get the vaccine with his HCP. Rituxan was the only medication he can think of to include in this report. Patient did not require a visit to the emergency room or the HCP office but was actually just getting the last dose of his treatment with Rituxan and then they drew his labs and the labs stated his platelet count had completely crashed the last time they checked his lab work. His platelet count was 3000 on 26Mar2021 and the platelets went up relatively quickly after that. Patient did not have treatment other than just the steroid of the very high dose Dexamethasone. Patient would like Pfizer&#39;s opinion and was not entirely sure he can get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and was asking what was recommended; patient aware that Pfizer was unable to offer medical advice or treatment recommendations and was referred to his HCP. Patient still on steroids very high dose Dexamethasone and got IVIG in the hospital; states he has no lot numbers, expiry dates, dosages or NDC numbers for the Dexamethasone or IVIG to provide. He has his patient card for the Pfizer Vaccine and states for the lot number, he thinks it was SH1555218 but does not locate other information including other numbers that could be the lot or the expiry date or the NDC number; states the patient card information was not handwritten and he can&#39;t tell what the lot number was and states this information was embedded like a bar code on his patient card. The outcome for the events platelets completely crashed, arm got a little sore was unknown and for events felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms was recovered on 24Mar2021.

Compelled by an act of stupidity to eat a muffin at 10:30pm went to bed around midnight. Woke up around 1am feeling queasy and began projectile vomiting. Evacuated all of that and then had a dry heave and it was over. In all only lasted about 6-7 minutes. I got the sheet I was handed when I was given my vaccine and saw this website. I looked at the chart and saw this did occur with the second dose and  saw that this was relatively common in getting the second shot of the vaccine and just wanted to report it since I?m not about to go to sleep. Checked my temperature and it is around 96 and was around 98 when I was going to bed at around 11pm

A 24-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158; Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eye allergy. Concomitant medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AMOXICILINA CLAV) taken for eye allergy from 12Apr2021. On 14Apr2021, he received the first dose of the vaccine about an hour ago and waited five minutes and went to the bathroom. He had a severe reaction while patient was in the bathroom, he started to feel dizzy, had a terrible headache and chills. He walked out of the bathroom at the store and fell out completely in front of the pharmacists. The patient also experienced weak with shilling (as reported) and started sweating. The pharmacists called 911 and the responders checked his vitals and blood pressure and all of that and everything was fine. Patient clarified he passed out completely for almost 5 minutes. Patient stayed there with everyone until, they were waiting to see how he was doing. He reported he was feeling much better now, still feel a bit dizzy, not 100% but not as bad as when it happened. It has improved and he definitely felt terrible at the time. He was monitoring himself at home to see if he notices something weird going on. He does not have a headache right now and was feeling much better. When he was having the effect, he was mentally sharp, and knew what was going on. He thought about letting himself walk outside the bathroom so he could be seen. He didn&#39;t lose track of what was going on and body reacted adversely. He remembered stuff and everything and he felt good. Patient stated the chills went away; however, would not say they went away completely, he was recovering. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office and the paramedic said it was not necessary right now because all the vitals and everything else seemed fine. There was no therapy received for the events. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the vaccine and no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of events feeling dizzy, terrible headache, chills was recovering; still feeling very sick was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

                                                On December 16th, I received my 1st dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine at 11:49am. I was off of work for the remainder of the day and driving to an appointment at a different town. Between towns, during the drive fatigue settled in and I started to get drowsy. I switched seats and fell asleep for some time in the vehicle. I had fatigue for about 3-4 weeks following the 1st dose. On December 23rd, my symptoms started to get worse. Headaches increased, muscle pain/aches, chills, fatigue and this was the first day I had a temp of 100.4. I took some Tylenol and it made it bearable for me to continue to work throughout the day. From 12/20-26/2020, I kept feeling like I had a cold or the flu. Through the Holiday, I remained in bed and didn&#39;t have energy to do anything. I still had all the symptoms and decided on December 28th to call into work and get seen for a Telehealth. Some lab work were done and test results came back. I&#39;m still working with my provider on figuring out what&#39;s going on with me.

The fatigue gradually increased throughout the day. I attempted to go to bed around 11:00pm and I was so cold my entire body was shivering to a point where my whole body was shaking. I also began noticing muscle cramps throughout my body as well, primarily located in my calves. Eventually fell asleep around 2:00am (symptoms were preventing me from falling asleep), when waking up noticed the symptoms had resolved.

A 25-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL1284, unknown lot number), intramuscular in left deltoid on 30Dec2020 at 19:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation/to prevent getting sick, to prevent the spread. Medical history and concomitant medication reported as none. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 30Dec2020 in a hospital. On 07Jan2021, he tested positive for COVID. His second dose is scheduled on 22Jan2021 and wants to know if he should get that or if there is any recommendation. The patient clarified that the COVID symptoms began on 06Jan2021.

It has been 3 days and this headache had not resolved. I have been on tylenol  Q6-8 hrs and ibuprofen in the AM.  In addition, I experienced on and off chills, fatigue, and malaise. This headache has been very concerning and i hope it will eventually subside

He states he has not had a COVID infection to his knowledge, despite working on the COVID unit at the clinic. Member admits to nausea, fever, chills, hallucination,  and malaise. Denies HA, cp, sob, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, or LE swelling.   A/P: 1. Adverse effect of other viral vaccines, initial encounter Plan/Comment(s):  - 25 yo presents with what is likely a normal adverse reaction in a patient that has been exposed or infected by Coronavirus 19 in the past. He likely contracted the virus while working 2 months on the COVID ward at Clinic, which would be considered an asymptomatic infection. He denies having symptoms of COVID. While he did have an MMR booster the day before receiving the COVID vaccine dose #1, it was my opinion that because of his age and health status at the time of the screening, he was clear to receive the first dose of the COVID vaccine. I did consider possibility of cytokine storm, having been given two vaccines in such close intervals, but again he is young, healthy, and denied having COVID infection in the past,  and he did not exhibit any adverse reactions to the MMR booster.  I anticipate his condition will be self-limiting and the SM will return to full duty in 48 hours.   Reference:   11) Have you received any vaccine in the past 14 days or plan to receive any vaccine in the next 14 days? Currently there is no data on safety or efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine administered with other vaccines, however, the agency recommends that COVID-19 vaccines be administered alone with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration with any other vaccines. Vaccines required for post-exposure prophylaxis (e.g., rabies vaccine) may be administered within the 14-day period.   ***************Additionally, providers and patients can consider other vaccines, including the influenza vaccine, within the 14-day window on a case-by-case basis with shared clinical decision-making for Health Protection and other important co-administration vaccination needs.************  - will Rx Zofran - will Rx Tylenol - will Rx Motrin - SIQ  48 hours - Patient counseled on dx, tx, and plan; pt understands and concurs

Man working brought me a bottle of water which I chugged, symptoms mostly passed a couple minutes later.  Was still dizzy for another 20 min but after that it passed.
