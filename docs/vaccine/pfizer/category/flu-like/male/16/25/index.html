His mother gently lowered him to the ground (@ 1804). Patient&#39;s mother stated he just passed out and that this was his first injection ever in his life. Patient was immediately assessed by multiple nurses. Patient did not fall or hit his head or injure any part of his body. Patient took less than 60 seconds to respond to verbal commands and comprehend what had happened. Patient&#39;s legs were immediately raised and vital signs were obtained. He was diaphoretic and pale but both were dissapating.  Patient denied difficulty breathing, pain, discomfort. Patient was moved to a reclined chair. Patient and family at side (mother and father) agreed to be monitored. At 1828, Patient complained of feeling &#34;a star&#34; on the left side of his chest. Patient was unable to describe this further. I asked if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. I instructed patient to take several deep breaths in through his nose and out through his mouth. After doing this 3 times, patient stated he did not feel anything funny in his chest anymore. At 1835, while still seated in a reclined chair, patient passed out again. He was pale and diaphoretic. A few team members saw him jerk/twitch and it was questionable if he was having a seizure. The jerking did not last but a few seconds. 911 was called @ 1826. Patient was transferred to a wheelchair and put in the ambulance @ 1841. Vitals were obtained throughout and charted. Pulse ox saturation levels were not below 96%. Immediately after the patient passed out the second time, his pulse was measured at 38 bpm and his lips displayed slight cyanosis. His pulse quickly rose to 52 bpm, within less than 10 seconds. One minute later his pulse was up to 68 bpm.

                                                seizure like symptoms; Dizziness; lethargy; fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist.  A 16-year-old male patient received first dose of intramuscular BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 02Mar2021 at 12:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 16-year-old. Lot number was EN6205. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. On 02Mar2021 at 12:00, the patient experienced Dizziness, seizure like symptoms, lethargy, fatigue. It was unknown if the patient was treated due to the events. The patient recovered from the events in Mar2021. It was unknown if the patient had COVID prior vaccination; it was unknown if the patient was tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Seizure cannot be excluded.

They said he had a fainting episode due to the vaccination and did not have a seizure. The patient had not eaten anything  the whole day and he felt that contributed. Followed up with patient&#39;s parent and he is feeling just fine now.

                                                High blood sugars for a week now.  My son is 16 year&#39;s old and was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in November.  He is thin and active, and an otherwise healthy teen and runner.  He is in his &#34;honeymoon phase&#34; of diabetes and I think the vaccine may be killing off beta cells.  He went from having blood sugar levels in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s at 12 units of Lantus to now 120&#39;s to 130&#39;s and up to 160&#39;s immediately after the shot.  His mealtime insulin is also not working at the same number of units and he&#39;s going in the 200&#39;s when he was around 160&#39;s before the shot. It has lasted now for a week instead of the 48 hours I was told about and read about.   As soon as we were leaving from getting his vaccine, he started experiencing extreme fatigue.  That night and for 2 days he had a headache.  He is still more tired than usual and having to take naps.

He was able to respond to verbal commands, and never had complete LOC.  We were able to provide oral hydration and cold compresses.  After 15 mins I was able to have him sit in a chair, where he stated he was feeling much better.  After a total of 45 mins, he was able to walk out of clinic independently

                                                Patient was nervous upon receipt of vaccine.  It was an unscheduled (expiring) dose.  Per parent, he had fallen asleep outside vaccine room and they had to wake him up to get vaccine.   I gave immunization and asked him to stay for 15 minutes afterwards.  His Mom ran to consult window to notify staff patient was passing out.  I was sanitizing vaccine room so I immediately ran to him and his Dad and I caught him as he was slumping over.  He was shaking really hard, weak, and clammy.  He was coherent b/c I asked him his name but did not have clear recollection of timing of vaccine.  He was very pale in color.  His Mom grabbed him a Gatorade and he seemed very thirsty as he was drinking.  He mentioned he felt dizzy and that both arms were hurting and the arm I gave vaccine in felt like he had sweat dripping off it.  (I felt his arm and it did not).  I grabbed an instant cold pack and placed on his neck to help cool him off.  His color returned over the 30 minutes.  I asked parents if they wanted me to call ambulance but they wanted to wait and see how he responded.  He looked at his iPhone data and his heart rate had spiked.  Unclear if right before vaccine or right after but I believe he mentioned it went up to 120 when Mom said his normal resting heart rate was 60.  He ate some gold fish and seemed to perk up and have a few funny conversations showing his personality.  I explained to him very important to let parents know if he experienced any other side effects after leaving.  He was able to stand up and walk out of RX with parents.

His hands were clammy. He said he felt like his body was numb. We had him remove his mask and got him some water. He never actually lost consciousness. Eventually we had him lay down and put his feet up. His father was contacted and came to pick him up. We spoke to his mom later and she said he was feeling much better.

A 16-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 12:00 (at 16-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The caller is calling about her 16 year old son. She just left the doctor with her son who received his first Covid 19 vaccine. She would like to report an adverse event. Her son has had a fever of 105.2F (07Apr2021). The doctor just did blood tests, a rapid test for Covid that was negative, they tested him for strep throat that was negative and he doesn&#39;t have an ear infection. He&#39;s been running a fever over 105F for the past 2 days (07Apr2021). The caller wanted to rule out that nothing else is going on. They have called the Medical Director of (name)  and he didn&#39;t know what was going on with her son. If this fever continues she&#39;ll be calling Pfizer back. She is waiting on the results of his blood tests like his mononucleosis test pending and other viral and bacterial tests (unknown result). Her son started feeling bad about 4-5 days (unspecified date) after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. The last 2 days he&#39;s had a very high fever. He has a headache and body aches (unspecified date). He had a Covid 19 test not long before he received the Covid 19 vaccine and it was negative. She thought her son might have the Covid 19 virus but he had the rapid Covid 19 rapid test (09Apr2021) and it was negative. The caller does not know what is going on with her son. She took her son to a clinic because he was sick and because his fevers are too high. She also called the state but they told her that fevers are normal with the Covid 19 vaccine but if it persists after today, 09Apr2021, she needs to seek medical attention. It was further reported that earlier in the week her son told her he thought he was going to pass out at work (unspecified date). He told her he thought he had a fever but she checked it with a forehead thermometer and it didn&#39;t show a fever. Then on Wednesday, 07Apr2021, her son woke up around 4:30AM and had a fever of 105.2F with an oral thermometer. He woke Thursday, 08Apr2021 and this morning, Friday 09Apr2021 with a fever. His mother can control the fever during the day with Ibuprofen but he&#39;s spiking these fevers in the middle of the night. She knows fevers spike at night but she can&#39;t come with any other reason why this is happening. The patient lab tests and procedures also included CBC: pending, mononucleosis: pending, and rapid strep test: Negative; all from 09Apr2021. The outcome of events fever of 105.2f, headache, and body aches was not recovered; while for other events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He said he didn?t say anything  until his eyes were black and couldn?t see then he said he didn?t feel so good.  The color drained from his body and he went limp.  Luckily a nearby paramedic caught him and he was wheeled to a recovery room to be monitored. Patient felt better after 15 Mins but it was so scary.  We didn?t expect any reactions as hes gotten all of his immunizations and never had any reactions.  I was really traumatized by this whole event.  The staff there were very nice and helpful and helped us ease thru his recovery.  I wanted to report this incident so that way you have a log of adverse side affects from getting the vaccine.  I hope the 2nd shot will be ok.... I?m very scared at this point. TBD

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after being administered with Pfizer COVID vaccine patient became lightheaded and almost fainted. Patient did not fall out of chair, but did slouch over in chair. The patient&#39;s father alerted pharmacy staff and the nurse administering vaccines today, and I went out to check on him. Patient was sitting up in chair at this time, but was very sweaty, pale and cloudy. Nurse instructed him to place his head down by his knees and provided him with water, Gatorade, and cold compresses. Once patient was feeling a little bit better we moved him into a private room with father and let him lay down at rest. When patient felt okay to leave he was advised to lay flat when he got home and eat. Father was also advised to stay with him until he was feeling 100%. Event lasted approximately 30 minutes.  A call was placed to parents around 3pm to check on him and he was doing well. (moving around and playing video games)

A 16-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 16Apr2021 13:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 16-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mental illness and autism from unspecified dates and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2, administered in right arm on Mar2021 (Lot number was unknown), at the age of 16 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no other vaccines in four weeks. Several hours after receiving the second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 16Apr2021 20:00, the individual developed a headache and took ibuprofen (ADVIL) and water. About an hour later, he was disoriented and the parent (who was a nurse practitioner) asked him questions and he was having a hard time answering. Patient&#39;s fever was over 103 in the ambulance. He was tested for everything at the hospital and all was negative. It was determined to be an adverse reaction to the vaccine and what likely happened is his temperature spiked so quickly that he had a seizure. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment for other adverse events was unknown. There was no COVID prior vaccination and patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information about lot/batch has been requested.

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  Patient is a 16 year old boy with ADHD who presented with fever and myalgias for 3 days, that progressed to sharp parasternal chest pain and some SOB. Patient received second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 4/26, and after that shot experienced fever to 102 at home and myalgias. Subsequently his symptoms of chest pain have occurred. He underwent workup revealing of elevated Troponin, and EKG with some ST segment elevation, a slightly elevated CRP at 32, and a normal ECHO. Admitted for observation and concern for infectious myocarditis vs MIS-C. Cardiac MRI was done confirming Myocarditis, Troponin I was elevated and peaked at 23, 325pg/mL. Workup unrevealing of SARS. Other testing showed Resp virus panel negative, blood pcr for EBV, CMV, Parvovirus B19, enterovirus, and adenovirus all negative, HIV antigen/antibody testing negative. Patient treated with Ketorolac with steady improvement in symptoms over several hospital days. Discharged home 5/2 with Troponin I well down and symptoms resolved. Given reports in lay press regarding other cases of COVID-19 MRNA vaccine associated myocarditis, we are reporting this as a vaccine associated adverse event.

                                                Previously healthy 16 year old young man presenting with chest pain admitted for myopericarditis.   He was in his usual state of good health until 2 days ago when he experienced fever, chills and myalgias after receiving his 2nd dose of COVID pfizer vaccine. He improved until 5/2 when he developed a crushing, non-radiating, substernal chest pain which was waxing and waning in nature without specific alleviating factors. He had shortness of breath, but no palpitation, dizziness, or changes in pain on exertion vs rest. Family activated EMS who gave 325 mg of aspirin en route to the ED.   In the ED, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was mildly diaphoretic, but otherwise, unremarkable on physical exam. STAT EKG showed ST elevations in V5 and V6 and ST depressions in V1 and V2 as well as PR depressions, which persisted on repeated EKG. Given concern for myopericarditis, they ordered labs including CBC, CMP, troponin and inflammatory markers which were only remarkable for troponin of 1.94 and CRP 3.5. Chest x-ray was normal.    Cardiology was consulted and they recommended transthoracic echo which is pending. Cards also recommended starting Ibuprofen 600 mg q8 hrs and admission to cards for further management.

Still has difficulty focusing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father). A 16-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: ER2613 and expiry: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 31Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 16-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Vaccination was taken because he was going back to school. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EN6199, Expiry: Jun2021) on 10Mar2021 at 13:30 in right arm (at the age of 16-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and experienced loss of taste and smell and joint pain, all events started in Mar2021. Medical history included mild allergy to Birch pollen (which everybody has, but nothing else/patient tested for allergies, and had no significant allergies, they thought he might be because he spilled a sugared soda behind his bookcase in his room and there was mold growing so they thought he might be allergic to mold, so they tested for allergies and he has no allergy to mold) and ongoing vitamin supplementation. Family Medical History included Sarcoidosis with mother. Concomitant medications included vitamin d3 for vitamin supplementation from 2020 (about a year ago) and ongoing; ascorbic acid, rosa canina fruit (VITAMIN C) for vitamin supplementation from an unspecified date (several years ago) and ongoing and an unspecified ongoing multivitamin from an unspecified date (several years ago) at 1 taken daily for vitamin supplementation. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm at 17:30, tiredness at 20:30, shortness of breath, headache at 22:30 and muscle pain at 22:30. On 01Apr2021, the patient experienced fever at 00:30, chills at 01:30, redness at 02:30, leg pain at 08:30, fatigue (ongoing) at 02:30, joint pain at 08:30, too sick to get out of bed and passed out and hit the floor, put a big bump on his head at 05:30 (about 15 hours after second dose, patient was at the kitchen table with his head between his knees trying to breathe, passed out, hit the floor and put a big bump on his head). On 02Apr2021, the patient experienced brain fog at 14:30, swelling at 14:30, swollen glands at 02:30, loss of taste and smell to some extent at 14:30 and too sick to get out of bed. On day 2 (02Apr2021) and was still about pushing 100 degrees Fahrenheit and on 21Apr2021 (after 21 days) sometimes over sometimes less. On the following Monday (05Apr2021), he struggled back to school after 5 days, but came home early. He has just been trashed, too trashed to train for his sport, further described as too weak to train, he hadn&#39;t trained for 3 weeks. He still has a fever. His local doctor did not have any suggestions other than he should take acetaminophen and ibuprofen alternately to get rid of the headache and fever. In 2021, the patient experienced 2-inch diameter raised circle at injection site and disappeared after 10 days and there was a time he could not barely remember his name, tried to study but just wasn&#39;t there, head on desk. Still has difficulty focusing and doing his calculus. It was reported that the time to recover from any exertion seems to be longer by a lot. On 01Apr2021, body temperature reached 103 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient tried to do a few things like a week ago just because he couldn&#39;t stand to be in the house anymore he took a bike out for about 15 minutes and was just trashed from that experience and took 3 days to recover. The events did not require emergency room visit nor physician&#39;s office neither hospitalized. The outcome was recovered from loss of consciousness, head injury on 01Apr2021; from illness on 02Apr2021; from headache on 04Apr2021; from chills on 06Apr2021; from pain in arm and fatigue on 07Apr2021; from erythema on 11Apr2021; from ageusia and anosmia on 14Apr2021; from lymphadenopathy on 16Apr2021; from arthralgia on 17Apr2021; from myalgia on 18Apr2021; from leg pain on 21Apr2021; from vaccination site swelling in 2021; then recovered with sequel from dyspnoea on 05Apr2021 and from swelling on 07Apr2021; then recovering from pyrexia, feeling abnormal; then not recovered from asthenia and unknown for the remaining events.

                                                Patient developed headache and chills the evening after receiving the vaccine on 5/5/21.  The following day his throat was sore and he had cough and chest tightness.  He took an albuterol  neb which relieved the cough and chest tightness.  I saw him in clinic on 5/7/21.  His COVID PCR was negative.  His lungs were clear.  My assessment is that most likely his symptoms were related to a respiratory virus or seasonal allergies triggering his underlying asthma.  I do not suspect that his symptoms were related to the vaccine.

                                                Patient is a previously healthy 16 year-old M presenting with acute onset chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, malaise, fever and myalgia to ED on 5/6/2021 at 20:44.  He started experiencing symptoms on 5/6/2021 morning a t06:07 AM.  He received his second dose of  Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 5/4/2021 10:: AM.  In the ED, CBC, CMP and UA was within normal limits. EKG at 20:46  and again at 21:14 showed  ST segment elevation in inferolateral leads with possible myocardial injury, ischemia or pericarditis.  Troponin 0 hour was 835 and at 2 hours 1674.  Patient was admitted to the PICU for further evaluation and management. Echo on 5/6/2021 showed normal LV systolic function with SF 31%  . Cardiac MRI on 5/7 showed contrast enhancement of inferolateral wall consistent with myo-pericarditis with small pericardial effusion.  Troponins were trended every 12 hours and plateaued in the 1800&#39;s on 5/8/2021. Patient was diagnosed with acute myo-pericarditis. Respiratory viral PCR and COVID-19 PCR on 05/06/2021 were negative. Thyroid studies were normal. ANA titer is pending. Viral serology for HbsAg was negative and HIV was non-reactive. Results for additional viral serologies for Coxsackie viruses, EBV, CMV and HHV6 are awaited. Patient was treated with  NSAIDs and Colchicine. IVIG was not given based on clinical judgement. Pediatric Cardiology was involved in patient&#39;s care and clinical decision making. Patient remained hemodynamically stable on room air throughout his PICU course. He was discharged on 5/9/2021 with Pediatric Cardiology outpatient follow up in 2-3 weeks. He will continue Ibuprofen 600 mg every hours and Famotidine 20 mg 2 times daily until his follow up.

                                                Child woke up at 3 am with severe nausea. Within minutes he complained about not being able to breathe. His lips turned blue and he was about to pass out. As I was able to keep him awake, I am not sure whether he would have had a febrile seizure (it very much looked like it) or just fainted. The fever spike was too fast, and his body couldn&#39;t handle it. His extreme nausea persisted for four hours (but he didn&#39;t vomit). He was completely debilitated. Fever spiked to 103 but stabilized at 102 for the following 24 hrs.

                                                Patient received his 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine on Tuesday 4/27/2021; he had low grade fever (100.3 deg F) on Wed 4/28/2021. On Thursday 4/29/2021, he developed &#34;heartburn&#34;, and on Friday 4/30/2021 he developed chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

                                                Patient was given first dose and was in waiting area for observation.  About ten minutes after his shot our vaccine coordinator alerted me that he was having a reaction. When I went out to the patient his eyes were open but he was staring blankly. His father was shaking him and waving his hand in front of his face and asking him if he was okay and the patient was not responding. I also tried to get the patient to respond and he did not. Since the patient was not responsive to any questions we called 911. While waiting on the paramedics to arrive the patient came around and started to answer some simple questions. He was clammy and sweating and he threw up one time. When the paramedics arrived they took over. They checked all the patients vital signs  and were with him for about 15 or 20 minutes assessing him. The patient walked out of the store on his own and was not taken by ambulance.   I called the patient around 3:10pm to check on him and I spoke with him and he said he was doing fine.

                                                Started with sore arm and headache, progressed to high fever (101). Next day had sores on mouth, which spread all over lips and started sore throat. Fever did not go away without medication. Medication would alleviate it but it continued for 6 days, reaching 102.4.  Pediatrician tested for strep and for COVID, both were negative.  Sore throat persisted after fevers subsided.  Had to finally be prescribed magic mouthwash. Doctor said sores on lips were herpes so prescribed viral medications.  My son never has a sore throat and has never had a herpes sore until after the shot.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable reporter reporting for her son, via Pfizer sponsored program.  A 16-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose at the age of 16-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.   The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  After 24 hours from vaccination, on 25Apr2021, he felt pain on the injection site. For that, the mother gave her son Tylenol to treat the symptoms. Then after 24 hours, on 26Apr2021 he felt fine. However, 2 days after, on 28Apr2021, he felt pain underneath the left side of his armpit, had a fever with a temperature of 102.8 F, and the right side of his neck was swollen. In addition to this, he was experiencing a lot of body aches, headache, and pain on his neck. They already contacted their HCP and prescribed him with antibiotics in Apr2021. He was tired and almost lethargic in Apr2021. Reporter wanted to know if her son should still receive the 2nd dose. The reporter was invited to consult her HCP. The outcome of pain on the injection site was recovering, of all other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events Neck swelling, Armpit pain, and Fever cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Second dose of Pfizer vaccine received Friday afternoon (4/2/2021). Went to bed Friday evening with &#34;normal&#34; side effects of mild fever and sore arm at injection site. Woke up Saturday morning with no sense of smell or taste. Called primary care provider who conducted a video visit and expressed concern that he may have had an asymptomatic case of COVID-19 prior to injection (no symptoms displayed at all in weeks prior). Order a COVID test for Sunday morning. Woke up Sunday morning with sense of taste and smell back. Proceeded with PCR test, which came back as &#34;negative&#34; on Sunday evening. No other symptoms observed, and other side effects noted above (sore arm, fever) resolved by Sunday morning as well. Seems to suggest loss of sense of taste and smell likely due to vaccine since there was a clear temporal relationship which resolved in approximately 24 hours.

                                                Within 1-2 minutes my son passed out and started violently shaking/convulsing. His chin was pinned to his chest, he struggled to breath and was making a sound as if he was loudly snoring but seemed to be struggling to breathe. I was unable to wake him. I&#39;m not sure how long it lasted but maybe 2 minutes or so. He woke up and asked what was going on as we had all been standing over him trying to unsuccessfully wake him.  He shared that he thought he&#39;d been asleep and had been dreaming. He also shared that his throat hurt very much. He had the shakes for about 30 minutes after and was extremely exhausted. He slept for 14 hours as soon as we arrived home.

                                                The next morning, he had a severe sore throat that felt like strep throat, severe tiredness  and then turned into a massive runny nose  and then a cough.   He was Lethargic for several days.  He hasn&#39;t been to school, so we don&#39;t know how he could have gotten massive cold like symptoms.  Its been several days and no one else has gotten sick who has been around him, so we don&#39;t think it was a cold but must have come from the shot.

Then he started to seem like he might pass out.  Then he was shaking for a few moments and his body straightened out on the chair and he seemed like he might be having a seizure.  I had someone call 9-1-1. I stayed with him until the paramedics arrived.  He kept seeming like he was nodding off, but when I spoke to him he was responsive.  By the time the paramedics arrived he said he was feeling better, but they checked him out, BP and HR and blood O2 were normal.  The paramedics offered transport to hospital but patient and his adult family member declined, and patient went home with his family member.

                                                Patient received vaccine and came and sat down next to his father in the waiting area.  Approximately 5 minutes after sitting down he fainted and fell out of chair.  His father guided his fall.  It took 2-3 minutes for patient to gain conscientiousness.  He was disoriented, pale, groggy.  911 was called and arrived approximately 20 minutes after event.  After the paramedics examined patient, he regained his bearings and color.  The family decided to go home at approximately 10am.  I spoke with mother at 7pm tonight and patient has been fine all day.

No immediate vaccine reactions. He went home, complained of pain at the vaccination site and took a nap because he stayed up late the night before.  On Thursday morning, he woke up with chills and feeling like having a fever. He took Tylenol and then took a nap. On Thursday night, he began to have chest pain but he did not tell his parents.  On Friday, he continued to have chest pain so he told his parents about it. His father told him that if chest pain got worse, they would go to an ER. On that night (Friday) at 1am, he told his parents that he was not feeling well, his chest pain had gotten worse and he wanted to be taken to an ER.

Two days later the cough went away, at the end when it left (four days after my first shot of the Pfizer biotech vaccine) every time I sneeze there is either snot and blood or just blood.  And it has not stopped two weeks later. And I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m experiencing Brain fog however I do feel a bit slow in my mind not lethargic in my physical body.

A 17-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Apr2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EW1064) as SINGLE DOSE  (at age of 17 years old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included epilepsy (interactable epilepsy) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications.  Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1 on 25Mar2021 09:00, lot number as ER8733,  in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation(at age of 17 years old). On 17Apr2021, the patient experienced increased seizure activity, fatigue/tired, confusion and memory issues. After the 2nd shot, about 4-5 hours, he experienced increased seizure activity and it has progressed to today, today he is a little bit better but it has progressed to point he is having a lot of confusion and memory issues. He has several different types of seizures but he has what are called mini seizures, the blank stare, the confusion. Nothing has stopped completely, he isn&#39;t back to his baseline as far as his seizures. He always has seizures, daily so she is calling about the increased activity and when she says his baseline she means he has not returned back to his baseline activity, but he is doing better than yesterday.  Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were horrible. Today he started to get back to his normal self. The events did not require a visit to the Emergency Room or Physician Office. Outcome of the increased seizure activity/mini seizures, confusion and memory issues were recovering. Outcome of fatigue/tired were not recovered.

                                                17-year-old male who presents with 8 days of headache.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 4/21.  He felt like he had the flu after getting the vaccine and developed right-sided neck pain and a temperature to 100.  The patient did endorse being elbowed in the neck playing basketball during this time as well, as he played in a basketball tournament in right after this.  He got his Covid vaccine in his right deltoid.  He saw his pediatrician on 4/26 and a CT scan of his neck with IV contrast was done and this showed significant diffuse right-sided deep spatial neck edema and right-sided adenopathy.  The pediatrician discussed the findings with ENT who recommended augmentin and a medrol dosepak.  The patient developed a headache several days after this and went to urgent care for evaluation.  There was concern that the augmentin and steroids had caused the headache, so the steroids were stopped and he was switched to keflex on 4/30.  He was given phenergan and toradol at Urgent Care and discharged home.  His mom notes that several days ago he had fevers of 101-104.  He has not had a fever for several days now.  His headache continued and he felt unwell at basketball practice so he returned to urgent care on 5/4.  A CT scan of his head was done which showed right sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis as well as thrombophlebitis of the right IJ. He was sent to ED for further management at that time.  In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable and well-appearing.  The CTs were overread by our radiologists here.  The patient had some labs done at the outside urgent care but PT/PTT/INR and a CRP were drawn here, which were unremarkable.  A Covid PCR is negative.  Neurosurgery, neurology, and hematology were consulted.  Neurology recommended heparin and a hypercoagulable workup and hematology agreed with this plan.  The patient was admitted to the ICU for neuro checks and monitoring during initiation of heparin.

Pharmacy staff came to his side and gave him wet, cold compresses and water.  He was feeling dizzy and clamy but never lost consciousness.  The pharmacist could see that the patient was wearing a CGM.  The patient was able to see his blood glucose levels on his receiver and they were high.  We were able to rule out hypoglycemia.  The patient threw up three times in the waste basket.  After about 20-30 minutes he started feeling better.

                                                The day after the vaccination started hives.  But it was slow so thought could be food allergic reaction. Over a period of 2 weeks it developed never went off.  Noticing the hives   getting worse and the epsode starting day after vaccination suspected it the cause and so went to primary care physician.  She diagnosed the hives related to medical side effects and only medical related item he had within the last 1 year was this vaccine.  She put him on Methylprednisolone for 6 days along with Cetirizine HCL 10mg.  The hives appeared to be suppressed for the first 3 days where the dose was higher, however, when the dosage was getting lower after day 3 it came back with high intensity.  Lips, fingers, tongue...swollen and with fever running at upto 101.6.  Again went to the doctor, she put him on Prednisone with 40 mg for 3 days, 20 mg for 3 days, 10mg for 3 days and 10mg alternate days.  It literally took more than 1 and half month still not recovered.  Hives are still on and also severe cold with mucus and cough started since (05/09/21).  Fever show up on and off even now.  We&#39;re referred to allergy specialists.  She asked to not take 2nd dose.  Increased dosage of Antihistamines, asked to continue Prednisone 10mg for 6 more day daily 10mg and if cold and cough does go in the next 2 days may put on antibiotics.

We were thinking pt was still having flu like symptoms.  On Saturday, April 24, 2021, pt was still complaining about chest pains.   He was tired and not acting normal.   We took his blood pressure twice and his heart rate was 105 bpm..  Can not exactly remember blood pressure (seemed very off).  Took pt to the hospital where they measured his heart rate at 107 bpm.

Patient sat down in the chair and rolled sleeve up. Chose L deltoid for injection site. He was talking with a friend and writer gave injection. Placed band aid. Patient was quiet and looked like he was going to get up but fell forward out of the chair. He hit his L forehead on side of wall. Writer caught patient and sat him up on the ground. Eye?s were dilated, he was diaphoretic, zoned out and not responding initially to voice, but eyes were open. Eventually got patient up to a wheelchair and taken to office area to lay down and monitor. Father was notified and sat with us after he arrived at the school. Patient drank 1 full 120cc orange juice and approximately 6oz of water. Throughout monitoring patient gradually felt better. Pupils corrected to normal, wasn?t diaphoretic anymore, and vitals improved. He stated this has happened before with lab draws and shots, but not this severe. Writer and colleagues informed him to notify people that are going to give him shots or lab draws about his history. Also informed him to notify his teachers if he feels anything out the ordinary for the rest of the day. Make sure he hydrates. Patient then sat up and walked in the room. He stated he felt fine like before getting the shot. Patient left stable and under his own power.

He received the COVID vaccine 5 days ago in the afternoon and initially had what he expected to be normal side effects from the vaccine that evening. Symptoms included body aches, runny nose and general malaise. However, over the last few days he has felt worse and developed more congestion, cough, and sweating. He did improve a little bit 2 days ago but then started to feel worse yesterday and had a worsening cough that is resulting in some chest tightness. Cough is productive sounding. Mom describes it as barking. No appreciable wheezing but he sounds hoarse. He has some SOB after coughing repeatedly. He states it simply feels like it is hard to breathe for 10-20minutes after a coughing attack but then it resolves. He developed sweating yesterday as well. He states he will just start sweating for no reason. No measured fever. No chills. Today he has dried skin and cracked lips from blowing/wiping his nose all the time. No fevers. No vomiting.

                                                Intense headaches the day after taking the shot, back pain from the waist up. 2 days later I woke up with chest pain and the lingering headache, my chest feels heavy and maybe shortness of breath. I did a bunch of research however I did not find anything about chest pain related to the second dose of Pfizer. I am not sure if it is some type of tissue or muscle pain or something more serious. When I massage my chest it does not ache like the muscle pain from my shoulder so id assume it has to do with maybe my lungs or heart.

He incidentally had some weight loss noted at the visit over the previous 6 months for which I did some lab work. The lab work was normal except for his platelet count which was 111,000. A repeat platelet count done a week later was normal at 273,000. Because of the transient decrease in platelet count and the 3 days of bad headache after the vaccine, I decided to hold off on  getting a second Covid vaccine. Additionally and possibly of no significance, his mother apparently had a history of ITP during her childhood.

                                                17-year old M with history of recurrent ear infections requiring PE tube placement who was in his usual state of health until 5/5 when he noticed a new itchy hive-like rash. He was short of breath 5/6, and developed fevers that night along with vomiting. He was seen 5/6 with negative COVID19 PCR and documented fever to 104. Fevers continued, and he was admitted the evening of 5/10 with concern for myocarditis. See below for hospital course. Additional information for Item 18: ...Screening labs were notable for mild lymphopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and elevated inflammatory markers.  Given prior COVID infection, rash, and systemic inflammation, additional studies including troponin, D-dimer, BNP, and EKG were obtained.  EKG was reassuringly normal, however the D-dimer (2.48), troponin (1.27), and BNP (469) were elevated.  Other work-up included chest x-ray which was unremarkable, and right upper quadrant ultrasound with incidental cavernous hemangioma of the liver.  He was started on milrinone (5/11-5/12) after initial TTE was concerning for severely diminished LV function. Follow-up TTE 12 hours later was normal (on milrinone), and remained so after milrinone was discontinued 5/12. Follow-up TTE after discontinuation remained normal. Cardiac MRI was completed 5/14, although read remains pending. He received IVIG on 5/11, and was started on methylpred 50 mg IV BID, Anakinra 100 mg SQ BID 5/14,  and transitioned to prednisone 30 mg PO BID with clinical improvement, down-trending troponin and systemic inflammatory labs.  Subsequent CBCs have been notable for rising leukocytosis (5/16 WBC 56.3) and thrombocytosis (5/16 plts 690) and 4&#43; spherocytes (with no known personal or prior history of spherocytosis). He will likely be discharged 5/17.   Infectious evaluation was unrevealing including cultures and viral studies. COVID spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were sent, but remain pending. Pt. initial COVID-19 infection was diagnosed October 2020, with positive saliva PCR testing.  He was symptomatic for 3-5 days.  He received his second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine 4/27 in his left arm; denies any significant reactions (arm swelling, injection site redness, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, fatigue, or fever). He has had passing contact with school classmates who have recently been diagnosed with COVID19.

                                                This is a 18 y.o. male who is generally healthy. He received a second dose of the SARS2-COV vaccine on 3/4. The following morning he felt feverish and achy with malaise. He stayed home, drank fluids and rested and felt well enough to come up to ski this weekend. During skiing he had some anterior chest pain, it resolved and he went about his day. Tonight at 2245 the pain became sharp and awakened him from sleep. He felt nauseated and clammy as well. Father brought him to the ER for evaluation. His emergency department evaluation showed ST elevations most notably in the inferior and lateral leads as well as in the lateral precordium.

Later in the day of 3/12/21, Patient began to spike a fever which eventually went to 102. He continually suffered from headaches, fatigue, body aches, and chills.  We attempted to control the symptoms with Tylenol. All symptoms continued on Saturday.  There was some minor control with Tylenol.  At approximately 9:30 am  patient had discomfort in his left underarm, when he lifted his arm, he became aware of a tennis ball size lump under his arm. Patient was suffering from severe lymphadenopathy in his left underarm and down the left side of his neck, with less severe but significant lymphadenopathy in the right underarm and down the right side of his neck.  Patient&#39;s fever continued to hover around 101 to 102 Saturday and Sunday. There were times, within an hour of taking Tylenol that it might drop to 99, but would go right back up.  He continued to experience fatigue, chills, etc... His fever finally broke on Monday morning and he is still experiencing some lymphadenopathy, but the lymph nodes are starting to reduce s of 3/17/21.

Patient seemed much better after discussion and was ready to get vaccine.  Gave injection and he was doing fine and went to sit down for 30 minutes as recommended. After giving next vaccine about 15 minutes later patient apparently tried to come across waiting room to speak to me and started to fall. Next patient was leaving room and caught patient, preventing injury and called for help.  Multiple staff responded.  Patient reported dizziness and seeing colors.  Was breathing fast but not having any swelling or trouble breathing. Was able to stand after a minute and was taken to clinic that is right next to pharmacy for evaluation. Patient was evaluated and left within the next hour doing well.  Spoke to patient in the afternoon and reports recovering well, has a headache that he thinks is stress related.  Counseled to continue to monitor and seek medical attention if any worsening of symptoms.

Noted the following day this his eyes looked yellow, more that usual, and came to the clinic on 3/1/21 for evaluation.  was feeling better but due to acute jaundice had blood work that indicated markedly elevated bilirubin and low platelets.  Further testing for hepatitis was negative.  Was sent to the ER the following day as we were unable to get blood drawn and GI consult was desired.  There he had a normal abdominal US and bilirubin had dropped and he has since been followed by GI and is currently being evaluated by Hematology for any underlying conditions that may be contributing.

                                                Pfizer &amp; Biotech vaccine was administered to the patient and after the vaccine we asked them to have a sit for 15 minutes. During that time, patient experienced headache and nausea. Patient did mention that he usually eats right after waking up but on 3/31/21 he didnt eat anything in the morning. His parents gave him water and he felt a lot better. Pharmacist called 911 because we thought that his throat was closing up but it was just nausea and his spit was coming up. After the 911 came they checked him out and he was doing okay and felt much better and did not had to go to emergency room. He was okay and then left after 30 minutes of observance. I also called the patient at around 4 pm to make sure he was okay and patient said he was fine and was felling normal like before.

                                                My healthy 18-year old son had his first dose of Pfizer, and within a few minutes he felt dizzy. His heart rate was also rapid. He didn&#39;t think much of it, but the dizziness persisted and so they had him lay down with feet up. After about 20 minutes, he began to vigorously shake (rigors I believe is what it is called.) He felt numb in both arms and also his tongue and mouth. We had 3 nurses attending to him, and after about 30 minutes they decided to send him to the ER for evaluation since the very strong shaking and other symptoms were worsening. The shaking, dizziness, numbness all subsided after about an hour. He was given a Zyrtec upon first symptoms about 15 minutes after dose. The ER doc doesn&#39;t believe it was an allergic reaction but potentially a strong vasovagal response and immune response. He felt tired after but was completely fine 2 hours later. We were discharged from the ER a few hours later after evaluation. Vitals were in normal range including blood sugar, blood pressure and oxygen. He was fully hydrated prior and had a turkey sandwich and orange prior to coming so was not low on food either. The shaking was very extreme and concerning. It has been almost 24 hours and he is feeling fine other than a sore arm.

                                                Patient started complaining of headache and chest pain soon after vaccination.  Since then he has been to the Emergency Room 6-7 times for chest pain - workup is consistently negative He has seen two Cardiologists, a Neurologist and has had further workup.  It should be said that I feel it is probably not vaccine related and is likely anxiety related - however patient insists that it is related to the vaccine - he has never felt like this before.

Question is whether he should get the second shot or not. Is 6 to potentially 8 days of side effects a concern? Also, parent has been curious as to whether son was a long hauler from covid for brain fog but son thinks it could be burnout from school. Strange that  had such a long lasting reaction compared to to others his gneral age, including those who had covid after he had it so longer ago.

                                                Overnight, my (almost 19) son did not wake me, but reported to me in the morning that he had headaches, chills, numbness, thirst, and hallucinations. He was aware that they were not real during and after he had them, but it was a nonetheless disturbing experience.  He described to me having the need to hydrate all night and he drank a lot of water. This morning he was still having a headache and numbness as well as overall malaise, but has taken advil and eaten a light breakfast. He is dressed and up and around and seems to be improving. Should the symptoms return or worsen, we plan to take him for medical care.

I didn?t fall asleep for a few hours and couldn?t get out of bed due to coldness, lethargy, and muscle soreness. Next day had a moderate headache throughout the day that Ibuprofen didn?t help with. By 10 pm Friday all symptoms other than arm soreness had disappeared.

An 18-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Apr2021 at 12:45 (Lot Number: Ew0153) at the age of 18 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included autism spectrum disorder, ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) combined, learning disabilities. The patient had no known allergies. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medication taken within two weeks of vaccination included alfetamine aspartate/alfetamine sulfate/dexamphetamine saccharate/dexamphetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for an unspecified indication. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 in left arm, on 02Apr2021, lot # EK5730. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 23Apr2021 at 21:00 the patient experienced extreme hallucinations, not feeling well, chills, aches and pains, headaches, slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, he did not get much sleep, fever. The clinical course of events was reported as follows: My son reported to me at bedtime last night, the night of his second Pfizer vaccine dose, that he was not feeling well. I told him to take some Advil and go to bed. He had a very bad night with chills and aches and pains but most distressing was his description of having had extreme hallucinations. He said that he was aware they were hallucinations and not real during and after the experience, but it was nonetheless concerning. It is also concerning that he didn&#39;t wake me for help. At any rate, he did not get much sleep and I have to assume his fever went pretty high before morning. He described to me the need to hydrate during the night. He also relayed to me this morning an experience of headaches and slight numbness in his extremities, difficulty walking, but he is now feeling much better. He is dressed, has eaten, and is playing games on the computer. I am keeping a close eye on him today and should we return to that level of concern, we will take him to urgent care.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Patient (DOB 05-01-2003) received his 1st COVID vaccine (Pfizer, lot # EW0182 use by 5/15/21 at 0855) at 1539. The patient became pale approximately 30 seconds following the administration of the vaccine, EMT assisted the patient to the chair as he was standing up when he became pale, the patient loss consciousness for approximately 2 seconds. RN arrived at the station and assisted the patient to the ground, where he was placed in a supine position with his lower extremities elevated. The patients face mask was removed, he was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The patients color slowly returned to his face. Vitals were taken at 1540: BP: 155/70 (R arm, supine position), HR 70, RR 16, oxygen saturation at 97%, and pupils were equal. The patient had a history of fainting x 1 and his last meal was at 0800 and he stated, &#34; I didn&#39;t drink that much today.&#34; Denied any chronic medical conditions, was not currently taking any medications, and denied any drug allergies. The patient was moved to the anti-gravity chair and he was given pringles and Gatorade. Vitals were retaken at 1545: BP 162/80 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 50, RR 16, oxygen saturation at 97%. Denied any dizziness, headache, chest pain, or vision changes.  Vitals were retaken at 1553: BP 158/72 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 52, RR 16, Oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient was advised to eat a full meal prior to receiving his second COVID vaccine dose and to receive his 2nd dose in the anti-gravity chair. Vitals were retaken at 1558, BP 152/78 (R arm, sitting upright), HR 57, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient was also given a bottle of water, as he did not consume many liquids during the day. The patient&#39;s color fully returned to his face and he denied any shortness of breath, dizziness, changes in vision, or difficulty swallowing. Vitals retaken at 1603, BP 150/75 ( R arm, sitting upright), HR 60, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient called his mother to pick him up, as we strongly advised him to not operate machinery/ a vehicle after fainting. The patient&#39;s vital signs were taken at 1608, BP 140/75, HR 60, RR 16, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient was advised to drink the entire bottle of water, as his blood pressure was slightly elevated and it was most likely due to being dehydrated, as he did not consume any fluid since 0800 earlier that day. The patient drank a bottle of water and his vital signs were retaken at 1614, BP 122/68 (R arm, sitting upright) and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. The patient&#39;s mother arrived on site around 1630 and spoke with RN and both EMT. RN instructed the patient about emergency precautions and to follow up with his primary care provider. RN also educated the patient about the importance of informing the healthcare provider about his history of fainting with the first vaccine, when receiving the second COVID Pfizer vaccine. Gave the patient V-safe information and reported the occurrence in VAERS. The patient had a steady and even gait when leaving the site with his mother at 1632.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

I took a warm shower thinking the house was just cold, but when I went to bed after I started shaking with chills. I didn?t sleep well that night and during the day Thursday (01/21) I felt feverish and a throbbing headache. I tried sleeping throughout the day, still having the chills come and go. I took ibuprofen before heading the bed the next night and slept great other than feeling a little hot and sweaty. I showered the next morning and felt 100% again.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

On the day prior to arrival he developed increasing shortness of breath particularly with talking and with ambulation.  He also describes chest tightness with deep inspiration, the tightness radiates to back, no radiation to left arm or jaw.  Chest tightness is non-positional, but does feel worse immediately after he lies down from ambulation and then slowly dissipates.  His last subjective fever was yesterday evening.  He has never had a reaction to the vaccine before.  He has no allergies.  No prior medical conditions he is aware of, and takes no medications.  He did not experience any of the symptoms following the first vaccine. He has h/o asymptomatic COVID infection in November 2020. Cardiology consulted for concern of pericarditis post COVID-19 vaccine. He does not have significant ST elevation or PR depression.  He also does not have evidence of significant pericardial effusion at this point.  The high sensitivity troponins are mildly elevated.  He does have viral syndrome.  Is unclear if Covid vaccination was causally related to his symptoms.  We would like to improve his medications for better chest pain control and to prevent recurrent pericarditis in the future.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The vaccine was administered to the writer at 0800 on 1/5/2021. No immediate reactions were noticed for the 30 minutes observation period immediately after. The writer&#39;s muscle that received the vaccine began to become increasingly sore throughout the day; however, that was similar to the first dose of the same vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain was described as constant (2/10) but aggravated with motion. The pain did interfere with the writer&#39;s normal range of motion (specifically raising the writer&#39;s arm above shoulder height). From 0800-2200 on 1/5/2021 no noticeable symptoms except for the injection site pain occurred.   At 2200, the writer rapidly developed chills, body aches, a headache, fatigue, and a fever of 100.8. These symptoms were left untreated and continued through the night (the symptoms did not interfere with sleep). The writer woke up at 1300 on 1/6/2021; all previous symptoms had resolved by this time except for the injection site pain. By 1400 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed pain near the right axillary lymph nodes. The pain can be described as moderate (1/10) and generally occurred only with motion. The writer was unable to palpate any swelling in the area. Around 1800 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed it felt weird to swallow. Specifically, it felt as if there was a slight internal swelling 1-inch subhyoidally and 1-2 inches laterally within the right side of his neck when he swallowed. The swelling was not palpable from the skin&#39;s surface. The writer did not seek medical attention as breathing/eating/drinking were not made more difficult but monitored this closely. The swelling in the neck resolved by 2000 on 1/6/2021. The lymph node pain in the right arm resolved over the course of a few days and was no longer present by 1/9/2021 at 1300.

Migrane persisted for the next hour before the pain noticable dissappated; completely clear by 8:00 AM. Nasal congestion arose for a brief moment at approximately 6:30 AM but did not persist for longer than ten minutes. If relevant: I attended a gym (crossfit) session at 6:15 PM on 01/08/2021 which lead to deeper breathing, elevated heart rate, and major sweating. No side effects appeared to manifest at this time.

These spasms lasted until roughly 8am and were strong enough to rattle my 300lb bed frame. The only treatment I could think of at the time was to get as warm as I could so i covered myself in 8 blankets and just waited it out. It is now noon and the chills/spasms seem to be gone.

I was giving Benadryl and water when I arrived and they took my vital signs. There was one RN monitoring me there entire time, keeping conversation with me, and checking my vitals every 15 minutes. Then around 4:15 a physician said I was okay to leave.

This 20-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number ER8731) on 14Apr2021 16:45 at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number ER8733) on 28Mar2021 12:00 in right arm. The patient had no Known allergies. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient had no COVID tested post vaccination. The patient had not received other vaccine in four weeks. On 15Apr2021 04:00, his body was involuntarily twitching and his teeth was opening and closing as if he was having a seizure. He thought it was because he was cold so he put on 3 layers of clothes and 2 bundles of blankets and turned the heat up, but his body was still shaking and he was still cold. He tried to go back to sleep to see if that would fix it, but it did not until he went to work and around 7:30 a.m., the shivering stopped, but the headaches persisted and he had to ask to go home and he received an occurrence because he did not have a doctor&#39;s note. He clocked out at 8 and he went to sleep for an hour in the car in the parking lot because he was in no condition to drive home. Treatment received for the events included Acetaminophen and rest. The outcome of teeth was opening and closing as if I was having a seizure, body was involuntarily twitching, was cold, shaking, was resolving. The outcome of shivering was resolved. The outcome of headaches was not resolved.

                                                Symptoms started during bedtime and woke me up. Began with severe full body chills and full body muscle shaking and weakness during the night of 1/5 and early morning of 1/6, around 1000 to 0200. Slight headache began during that time as well.   Upon waking at 0900 on 1/6, chills and shaking decreased to mild severity, muscles still felt moderately weak and shaky, headache had increased in severity to a severe throbbing pain that worsened upon standing and walking, and moderate visual photosensitivity began. The headache persisted until I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen 200 mg, which is when the severity decreased to moderate after a few hours and then mild by bedtime. The photosensitivity persisted through the day and did not decrease much by bedtime.   Upon waking 1/7, there was only a mild headache and mild photosensitivity that faded completely within a few hours, no medication required. No more symptoms in the afternoon.

                                                ED Visit 3/11/21 History of Present Illness 21 year old man pmhx of autism, recurrent abscesses, presents with complaint of L axilla swelling and drainage. Pt received COVID vaccine in L arm on 3/1. Pt did well until 3/5 when he started to complain of pain in the L armpit. Mother examined the area and did not see anything concerning. The pain continued through the weekend, no fevers. Pt felt warm on Monday, no temperature taken. Mother then noted a few &#34;bump&#34; near the L armpit. The bumps continued to swell and be painful on Tuesday, went to pediatrician and was prescribed Keflex. Pt has been taking Keflex but continues to spike fevers, Tmax 102F on Wednesday. Pt had fevers yesterday and today of &#34;about 100.&#34; Pt took a nap today, and woke up with the area draining. Mother states that the drainage was smelly pus. Called PCP who recommended evaluation. ED course: Patient observed in the emergency department of antipyretics and did not have any further fever.  I will switch his treatment to clindamycin and provide topical bacitracin and provide strict criteria to come back if pt became febrile instructions provided to mom.   Patient safe for discharge to home. Discharged in improved condition. Written instructions reviewed with family.  3/18/2021 Discharge Summary History of Present Illness 21yo man with h/o autism and multiple soft tissue infections including cellulitis and pilonidal cyst who presented to the ED 3/13/2021 after axillary drainage and fever.  He had been treated outpatient with keflex, but continued to have fevers at home. Re-evaluated at ED and placed on clindamycin. Cultures from outpatient showing skin flora. Mother has been doing several dressings of drainage at home and ongoing fevers up to 102 so was brought to the ED for evaluation. No cough, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, recent travel, known sick contacts.  Summary of hospitalization: He re-presented to ED on 3/13/2021 and was started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. A CT scan with contrast done to determine extension of abscess, which was fortunately limited to the subcutaneous plane (no infiltration near bone or into muscle fascia). In the ED, patient&#39;s creatinine was 1.5. Patient received IVF and his creatinine downtrended to 0.75 on 3/18/21.   The surgical course was uneventful. Successful debridement of the left axillary abscess was performed on 03/4/21. Wound cultures grew Actinomyces Europaeus and S. Epidermidis and Infectious Disease was consulted. Their antibiotic recommendations to discontinue the cefepime/flagyl and start vanc/CTX were followed. Sensitivity analyses showed S. Epidermidis was sensitive to linezolid, tetracyclin, tigecyclin, bactruim and vancomycin. The Actinomyces Europaeus sensitivities have not yet resulted at time of discharge. Per ID recommendations, the vanc and CTX were discontinued and oral doxycycline was started, which should be continued for 6 months. It could be considered to switch to PO amoxicillin after 2 weeks and finish the 6 month course with amoxicillin. This will be discussed during outpatient follow-up. Per ID recommendations, the following labs should be checked 2 weeks after discharge (on 3/29/21) and could be spaced out to every 4 weeks thereafter if normal: CBC with differential, CRP, ESR, BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT.  The patient is scheduled to see (ID) on 5/5/21. Dermatology was consulted per ID recs for evaluation of spots on the chest and back. Per dermatology these spots are keloid, not suspicious for hidradenitis suppurative, there is no need for biopsy. For pilonidal cyst spot dermatology recommends rec hibicleans cream. Immunology was consulted for recurring abscesses and recommended the following tests, which were ordered, in addition to outpatient followup: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, specific Ab titers: for strep pneumo IgG (23 serotypes) and tetanus IgG, lymphocyte subsets, T cell memory panel, B cell memory panel, neutrophil DHR, CH50.  A wound VAC was placed on the left axillary wound bed on 03/15/21 and exchanged on 3/17/21.  Patient tolerated the wound vac changes well with 5mg of oxycodone taken 1 hour prior to the vac change. On 03/18/21 patient was discharged with a home wound vac and VNA.  At the time of discharged patient was afebrile, his pain was well controlled, his oxygen saturations were &gt;94% on room air, he was tolerating a regular diet and voiding/stooling without issues.

                                                I started feeling achy around 9:00 pm and felt like I was going to get more ill. I took some Tylenol in hopes it would help but it got worse throughout the night. During the night, I couldn?t hardly sleep due to feeling really hot and achy. I felt like I had a fever but did not have a thermometer to check it. When I woke up this morning, I noticed I had a knot on my clavicle which I believe it to be a swollen supraclavicular lymph node. I was unable to go to my internship today due to feeling ill but I am feeling better now after sleep and medication.

A 22-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot: EK5730) intramuscularly in left arm on 21Dec2020 (15:00-16:00) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received first dose of vaccine 21Dec2020 and SARS-Cov-2 positive 06Jan2021 13:00. The patient got COVID vaccine 21Dec2020, and was scheduled to get second dose on 11Jan2021. He had a sniffle the other day on 05Jan2021 night time and tested positive for COVID on 06Jan2021, so reporter wanted to know if he should still get second dose. His symptoms are stable. He is quarantining. He is on his way to do a PCR now. Reporter read somewhere people could have false positive in nasal. He is losing some taste from 07Jan2021 (01:00 - 02:00). Most things he can taste. Some he cannot. It is not completely gone but reduced by 30-40%. He did a mouthwash with a sting and is not feeling that sting anymore. He said last night, same thing. He did a mouth wash and did not really taste much. It is not as prevalent as it was before. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test: positive on 06Jan2021, positive COVID test 06Jan2021, 13:00, Nasal swab COVID. Event outcome of sniffles was recovering, while for other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The efficacy of a drug varies from one patient to another and can be affected by different factors; however, a contributory role of the suspect drug BNT162B2 to the reported event ___ cannot be ruled out. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                At around 10 pm. I started feeling really cold. By 10:30 I had really bad chills. I tried to lay down and warm up but by chills were extreme by the time I got in bed. They were so bad that I couldn&#39;t even hold my phone or drink water without extra effort. Then as I tried to sleep I started to feel really hot. I eventually went to sleep but woke up about two hours later feeling like I had a fever. I was hot and sweaty. During the night I woke up every two hours feeling this way, hot, and tired. Then at 6 am I woke up still feeling bad, but better. Now I had a headache that wasn&#39;t there before. I drank a lot of water and took advil. After a cold shower I started to feel a lot better.

                                                The patient was given the vaccine at 1:50pm. He was fine immediately afterward. He was sent outside the clinical room to wait his 15 minutes. When the pharmacist went to release him, he was pale, dizzy, and clammy. He stated that he did not feel good. The pharmacist fanned him to cool  him down. She also gave him a wet rag to wipe his forehead. He was given two teaspoonful of Benadryl 12.5mg/ 5ml. The patient stated that he was feeling dizzy and thought he was going to faint. The pharmacy called 911. The patient removed his jacket and mask as he was hot. The EMT arrived and walked him outside* I am not sure what happened after that

                                                Around 10pm, I was suddenly very tired and could not stop yawning. I typically am up until 12-1 most nights so this was out of the ordinary. While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

A 22-years-old male patient (Son) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. My son is having a tough time with the vaccine. Everyday he has a couple of side effects. He started with body ache and tiredness on unspecified date Apr2021. He had a pounding headache. His headache was moderate today. However, the headache symptoms are getting worst. Generally, the symptoms last a day his have been getting worst for 7 days. He has been taking Tylenol and Advil. But the Advil doesn&#39;t even seem to hep anymore.&#34; headache is a common side effect reported with the vaccine. If the symptoms persists or get worst please consult your HCP. Please note blood clot has not been associated with the vaccine. Patient is been experiencing what I considered to be pretty severe, I guess reaction in term of aches and headache. This morning he woke up with the pounding headache, he kid described it as pounding and I just I guess I want to ask because everywhere I read, it says mild headaches are common and aches and I understand that but I guess understanding why this, this is considered somewhat as severe reaction or is there anything he can do to alleviate the symptom and should he, I guess my question is actually I guess my question also is should he not possibly get the second dose if he is experiencing such bad headaches with the first dose. When paraphrased the concern, reporter stated, Yes, basically we are thinking if can do to alleviate it and then he could not get the second dose, if you have any advice, I guess and just let you know he went to his health center in the college he went to get a COVID test and a flu test just to make sure he doesn&#39;t have actual Covid or flu and those report I got yesterday and so they told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. When probed for event start date, reporter stated, I would say a day after, I would say 09Apr2021, I guess it&#39;s phantom (not clarified) with symptom, the first day he was just tired, as far as the headache that started on the 09Apr2021. He (son) also passed out after the vaccine, which I also did that I didn&#39;t have Pfizer I (reporter) had Moderna and I had that same reaction, so I think that sometimes happens to some people but that&#39;s it happens also. When probed for vaccination anatomical site, reporter stated, Outside of the body I guess, I don&#39;t know that for sure. Patient still having the problem (event), and out event outcome, reporter stated, Yes, I think persisting, I think it varies. Patient has been taking Advil (Ibuprofen) and Tylenol (treatment). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included influenza virus test: negative on 12Apr2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 12Apr2021. They told him that it&#39;s most likely still vaccine reaction. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of body ache (pain), tiredness (fatigue), pounding headache/headache symptoms are getting worst (headache). The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  QR Comment: Call handler not filed split case. Might have been split case.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I had injection site pain about 4 or 5 hours after my injection. Around 9:15 at night I felt slightly warm and could tell that I was becoming febrile, but I wasn&#39;t completely there yet. Around 12:45AM on January 9th, I had massive chills and uncontrollable shivering and muscle aches. I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen at 6:00AM when my chills came back. At 10:45AM I was feeling febrile again, and took 600 mg of ibuprofen followed by an hour and a half nap. I had slight malaise afterwards but did not feel febrile. By 5PM, I was feeling almost completely normal and was fever free. On the morning of 1/10, I am completely recovered.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The day after the injection, in the afternoon (so about 36 hours after the injection of the second dose), I started to develop slight chills and fatigue, but no fever. This was accompanied by a mass that developed under my right armpit, about 4-5 cm in diameter and bulging out to the point that I felt it touching my upper arm before I even saw it in a mirror. It was not red, and it was malleable with a small, hard nodule in the center. I used an ice compression and some ibuprofen over a few days, and it has receded about 95% of the way, almost back to normal.

A 23-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number and expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 20Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (3 weeks ago, thinks it was 05Jan2021) for COVID-19 immunization. The reporter stated that her son worked in a doctor&#39;s office and got the second COVID 19 vaccine on 20Jan2021.

I just need some sugar like juice.&#34; He denied difficulty breathing or chest pain. He was not nauseous nor did he vomit. I transported him to a private holding room via wheelchair and gave him a 12 oz can of Coca-Cola. He took sips and immediately reported feeling better. The initial vital signs I took were as follows: Temp 98.6 F, HR 67, BP 84/48 mmHg, RR 24/min, and SpO2 97%.  After recheck in 15 min BP improved to 106/62 mmHg, his became more pink and no more diaphoresis. I observed him for 30 minutes total and he was stable to go home. He drove himself home.

                                                First day: severe chills (extreme body shaking), and body temperature alternating between overheating and moderate/severe chills every several hours. Body fatigue, temperature varying from low 99 F up to 101.3 F. These symptoms subsided after about 2 days. Also developing during this time was an asthma attack, characterized by wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Patient has had life-long history of asthma, moderate, well-maintained with albuterol inhaler (life-long) and Qvar redihaler (beginning in early-mid 2020). However, after the common symptoms subsided, the asthma attack prolonged for over a week (2nd injection on 22 Apr 2021, and present as of reporting (03 May 2021). Albuterol inhaler would ease the wheezing, but no effect on mitigating the coughing / difficulty breathing. Qvar redihaler had no effect. Asthma attack would alternate in waves (approximately every hour up to 4-6 hour cycles), of breathing mostly clearly (some difficulty persisting), and severe attacks when extremely difficult to breathe.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history relevant to AEs. The patient stated he is a pretty healthy guy. All day after getting the vaccine he was fine. He got the shot at like 1 came home took a nap, ate some dinner, and was playing XBOX with the boys when this happened. At around 10:30 pm on 29Apr2021 he went to rub, his stomach just above his belly button and it hurt. He said that he read on line that that area is called the pancreas or liver, it has a lot of names for that area when looking online. He stated it&#39;s the left upper abdomen area he felt pain when he pressed on it. It radiated really fast across his abdomen while he was on the phone with mother. The more he pressed the more the pain got sharper, and it radiated right across the abdomen, mainly above belly button not too much in lower abdomen, not much in upper abdomen. It was very sensitive. He didn&#39;t have to press hard to trigger the pain. It was almost like the area was inflamed. It happened really fast and that it was his upper stomach not so much the lower part of his abdomen. He felt dizziness and nauseous and like a silly boy he tried to run to the bathroom. He stated that he fell and fainted. His butt was still a little sore from falling. He said when he woke up, he was sweating like he had been out side all day. He did not recall sweating any time he fainted in the past. The side effects were gone after about ten minutes. He was really light headed and had the crazy sharp pain in abdomen for about ten minutes and then it was gone. He had never had that kind of pain. He was laying on the floor for a couple minutes. He went to get his phone, and then sat back down and was sweating. He still had pain at that time but it only lasted about 10 minutes at most. He was still a little bit sore in some joints which was not unexpected. He confirmed that he had a little bit of sweating, and he fainted a little bit. Since the episode he hasn&#39;t felt any symptoms like that before, he has not had any pain like gastritis but he has had some random gastrointestinal things before. It&#39;s also reported nausea on 29Apr2021. No required to emergency room and physician office. He was on the verge of going to the ER while the pain was there. He was going to go until it stopped and to get checked out. No relevant test. The outcome of the events sore joints, dizziness and butt sore was unknown; for other events was resolved on 29Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

Went to urgent care evening of 2nd day, received 50mg diphenhydramine that suppressed itching enough to sleep. Woke up itching and red at 6am of 3rd day, took 25mg diphenhydramine. Took 40mg prednisone at 8am. Went to urgent care at 10am for worsening hives, spreading and covering torso and onto face. Received dexamethasone injection into glute and prednisone prescription was upped to 50mg daily for the next week.  Took OTC Zyrtec and Pepcid once following the second urgent care visit. Hives responded well after 2hrs post visit, assuming due to prednisone and dexamethasone. Day 4 (1/12/20) woke up with widespread hives that became further inflamed until an hour after prednisone taken with breakfast. Also woke up with slight sore throat and wheezing, both of which subsided. Currently scheduled to see an allergist on 1/13/20. No known allergies and no other known introduction of allergens in the past week.

                                                I got my second pfizer vaccine 0n 1/27/21 at 10 am.  I had no reactions at all after the injection was given.  I waited for 30 minutes and was perfectly fine.  Around 5 pm I started to feel symptoms.  I got the worst aches in my entire body i&#39;ve ever felt before, along with chills.  I felt extremely hot, I took my temperature and had a fever of 102.3.  I felt dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseas .  My head was throbbing.  I ended up taking 1000mg of tylenol to help reduce the fever, which seemed to really help.  I fell asleep and woke up the next morning drenched in sweat.  My fever was gone, but I still had a horrible headache and threw up from the nausea I was having.  It felt like I had a horrible hangover.

                                                Woke up approximately 14 hours after receiving dose #2 with body fatigue. My large joints (e.g., hips, knees, elbows, shoulders) started to develops aches/discomfort. A hot shower helped relieve the initial discomfort, and I took 1g of APAP ~45 minutes after waking up. I then reported to work, which is an ambulatory care clinic that is working a drive-up clinic. As such, I had to work outside in ~20F weather. I had 4 layers on my upper body and 2 layers on lower body with wool socks. The cold did not bother me for the first two hours as I was able to return to a warm area between patients; however, as work became busy, I spent more time outside. The aches/discomfort in my joints progressively worsened as well as the general bodily fatigue. I took another 500mg of APAP, but it did not help much more. Eventually, the cold and body fatigue made breathing uncomfortable, and my breathing became slightly labored. Returning to the warm environment helped the symptoms not get worse, but focusing on tasks became slightly difficult. I returned home at approximately 1630, took another 1g of APAP, and proceeded to sleep from ~1730 until 0530 the next morning. I woke up feeling much better.

                                                On Friday morning 2/26/21, we had a 24 yo male patient who had an anaphylactic reaction after his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He was instructed to wait on the chair, but had stood up at some point but was still in the pharmacy waiting area. A team member noticed he had fainted and called for help. The pharmacist on duty and immunizing tech came immediately to help him to a chair. At that point, he was conscious and talking. Then within a few seconds he started convulsing on the chair and lost consciousness. His eyes were open and head tilted back. A team member immediately called 911 and pharmacist administered 0.3mg Epipen to the thigh. We removed his face mask to check his breathing and also to allow him to breathe more easily. We also adjusted his head more forward and he started coughing. After about 15 seconds, he regained consciousness and could answer questions. EMT arrived soon after and took over. Patient does not have allergies or any history of anaphylaxis/ severe reaction from vaccinations. He did express some fear of needles and did not eat breakfast yet.

I was then moved to the observation area where my chest got tight, I had difficulty breathing and my temperature fluctuated which made me shake. When hives began to show on my face, neck and ears the on-site medical staff gave me a shot of epinephrine and Benadryl and put me on oxygen, during this time an ambulance was called by the staff. When I got to the hospital my heart rate and blood pressure was high, I was given oral steroids to help my anaphylaxis. For days after being released from the hospital I continued to have deep muscle pain and weakness in my left arm as well as a very strong headache

Around 6am I measured my axillary temperature to be 100.9 F and took 650 Tylenol once which broke the fever. I was unable to go in to work that day. Now, two days after the vaccine, my other symptoms have resolved aside from a painful, and visibly noticable, lymph adenopathy in my left arm pit the same side as the vaccine.

I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

                                                Starting at 12:30am on Sunday, I started experiencing severe chills and headaches.  I normally sleep through the night with no issues whatsoever (I&#39;m a healthy 6&#39;1&#34; 170lb 24-year-old guy with no co-morbidities) but had a restless night where my fever eventually rose to 101 degrees Fahrenheit.  This continued throughout the next 48 hours with my fever fluctuating between 99.5 and 101.  I woke up 5-6 times both nights completely drenched in sweat.

He advised within &lt;15 minutes following the vaccine he sensed the left side of his neck was swelling.  He notified Immunization staff who brought him to the ER via w/c. He stated the ERMD did not perceive/palpate any swelling or nodules, and treated him with IV Benadryl with resolution of s/s.  He did not require any other doses of benadryl.    He received his 2nd Pfizer covid vaccine on 3/30/2021 lot#ER8734 to right deltoid.  He stated within 15 min again, he had the sensation of throat stiffness (as if muscles really tight/tensed) and this made it difficult to breath and caused his chest to hurt. He was taken to the ER again and given Benadryl again with resolution of symptoms. He was released later without any reoccurrence of symptoms. He states he went to work on 3/31 where he began to feel bad/achy-feverish.  Today he had a fever (not taken), total body aches but mostly to his left hand.  He reports feeling fatigue and unable to do normal AM routine of working out.  He could only stretch today.  He denies any trauma, recent illness, difficulty breathing, swallowing, eating, ha, n/v/d, or other symptoms.

A 24-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: solution for injection, lot number: SH1555218 and expiration date was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 21Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing 22Q (diagnosed with this condition when he was about 4 years old). Immunodeficiency from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included rituximab (RITUXAN) taken for immunodeficiency, start and stop date were not reported. Patient states he received the 1st dose on 21Mar2021 about 9:00am or a little before that time and had a very bad side effect and was in the hospital for a couple of days. His weight was 162 or 163 pounds. Patient was immunocompromised and has issues regarding that lately and received Rituximab which is like a chemo; states after he had the Pfizer Vaccine on 21Mar2021, his arm that the vaccine was administered into got a little sore relatively soon after the shot and the main thing he was reporting that his platelets completely crashed which was the reason for the hospitalization (from 24Mar2021 to 26Mar2021). Patient states for the Rituximab he gets due to having some issues being immunocompromised, it was his 4th treatment with the Rituximab and states he has no lot numbers, dosages, expiry dates or NDC numbers to provide and states he was on the Rituximab for his immunocompromised status. His arm soreness was in the same arm that he had the Pfizer vaccine administered into and would say the following day after getting the Pfizer vaccine, he felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms that resolved completely like 2 days later and these symptoms went away. Patient was immunocompromised and has fairly serious health issues since he was age 4-5 and was able to get the vaccine with his HCP. Rituxan was the only medication he can think of to include in this report. Patient did not require a visit to the emergency room or the HCP office but was actually just getting the last dose of his treatment with Rituxan and then they drew his labs and the labs stated his platelet count had completely crashed the last time they checked his lab work. His platelet count was 3000 on 26Mar2021 and the platelets went up relatively quickly after that. Patient did not have treatment other than just the steroid of the very high dose Dexamethasone. Patient would like Pfizer&#39;s opinion and was not entirely sure he can get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and was asking what was recommended; patient aware that Pfizer was unable to offer medical advice or treatment recommendations and was referred to his HCP. Patient still on steroids very high dose Dexamethasone and got IVIG in the hospital; states he has no lot numbers, expiry dates, dosages or NDC numbers for the Dexamethasone or IVIG to provide. He has his patient card for the Pfizer Vaccine and states for the lot number, he thinks it was SH1555218 but does not locate other information including other numbers that could be the lot or the expiry date or the NDC number; states the patient card information was not handwritten and he can&#39;t tell what the lot number was and states this information was embedded like a bar code on his patient card. The outcome for the events platelets completely crashed, arm got a little sore was unknown and for events felt a little lousy and had very mild flu-like symptoms was recovered on 24Mar2021.

Compelled by an act of stupidity to eat a muffin at 10:30pm went to bed around midnight. Woke up around 1am feeling queasy and began projectile vomiting. Evacuated all of that and then had a dry heave and it was over. In all only lasted about 6-7 minutes. I got the sheet I was handed when I was given my vaccine and saw this website. I looked at the chart and saw this did occur with the second dose and  saw that this was relatively common in getting the second shot of the vaccine and just wanted to report it since I?m not about to go to sleep. Checked my temperature and it is around 96 and was around 98 when I was going to bed at around 11pm

                                                DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 1. Chest x-ray that was normal. 2. CT angiography of the chest showing no abnormalities. 3. Echocardiogram showing no significant abnormalities.  HOSPITAL COURSE: A 24-year-old male, primary care patient, received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination 3 days prior to admission.  Following this, he had a fever, chills, body aches, and then developed severe chest pain.  The pain was worse lying flat, better when sitting up and leaning forward and worse with a deep breath.  He had gone to an urgent Care and was recommended going to the emergency room.  The patient&#39;s troponins were elevated and his EKG was fairly classic for pericarditis.  He was felt to have probably viral myopericarditis and was admitted for observation.  He was placed on aspirin and colchicine.  He seems stable from Cardiology to be discharged on this regimen as well as symptomatic treatment.  It was not known whether the COVID vaccine was implicated with this or not.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: CONDITION:  Stable and improved.  MEDICATIONS: 1. Colchicine 0.6 mg b.i.d. 2. Aspirin 650 mg t.i.d. 3. Oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg every 4 hours p.r.n. for pain. 4. Zofran 4 mg sublingual q.8 hours p.r.n. for nausea.  DIET: Regular.  ACTIVITY: As tolerated.  FOLLOWUP: With Cardiology on May 3rd.  If worsened pain, shortness of breath, or high fever, return for evaluation sooner.  In which case, steroids may be administered.

A 24-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 ((PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EW0158; Expiration Date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 14Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eye allergy. Concomitant medication included amoxicillin sodium, clavulanate potassium (AMOXICILINA CLAV) taken for eye allergy from 12Apr2021. On 14Apr2021, he received the first dose of the vaccine about an hour ago and waited five minutes and went to the bathroom. He had a severe reaction while patient was in the bathroom, he started to feel dizzy, had a terrible headache and chills. He walked out of the bathroom at the store and fell out completely in front of the pharmacists. The patient also experienced weak with shilling (as reported) and started sweating. The pharmacists called 911 and the responders checked his vitals and blood pressure and all of that and everything was fine. Patient clarified he passed out completely for almost 5 minutes. Patient stayed there with everyone until, they were waiting to see how he was doing. He reported he was feeling much better now, still feel a bit dizzy, not 100% but not as bad as when it happened. It has improved and he definitely felt terrible at the time. He was monitoring himself at home to see if he notices something weird going on. He does not have a headache right now and was feeling much better. When he was having the effect, he was mentally sharp, and knew what was going on. He thought about letting himself walk outside the bathroom so he could be seen. He didn&#39;t lose track of what was going on and body reacted adversely. He remembered stuff and everything and he felt good. Patient stated the chills went away; however, would not say they went away completely, he was recovering. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office and the paramedic said it was not necessary right now because all the vitals and everything else seemed fine. There was no therapy received for the events. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the vaccine and no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of events feeling dizzy, terrible headache, chills was recovering; still feeling very sick was unknown; outcome of the rest of events was not recovered.

                                                On December 16th, I received my 1st dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine at 11:49am. I was off of work for the remainder of the day and driving to an appointment at a different town. Between towns, during the drive fatigue settled in and I started to get drowsy. I switched seats and fell asleep for some time in the vehicle. I had fatigue for about 3-4 weeks following the 1st dose. On December 23rd, my symptoms started to get worse. Headaches increased, muscle pain/aches, chills, fatigue and this was the first day I had a temp of 100.4. I took some Tylenol and it made it bearable for me to continue to work throughout the day. From 12/20-26/2020, I kept feeling like I had a cold or the flu. Through the Holiday, I remained in bed and didn&#39;t have energy to do anything. I still had all the symptoms and decided on December 28th to call into work and get seen for a Telehealth. Some lab work were done and test results came back. I&#39;m still working with my provider on figuring out what&#39;s going on with me.

The fatigue gradually increased throughout the day. I attempted to go to bed around 11:00pm and I was so cold my entire body was shivering to a point where my whole body was shaking. I also began noticing muscle cramps throughout my body as well, primarily located in my calves. Eventually fell asleep around 2:00am (symptoms were preventing me from falling asleep), when waking up noticed the symptoms had resolved.

Made it about ~20 feet before getting severely lightheaded where I had to sit on the floor for 15&#43;minutes. My roommate reported I was white as a ghost. I was on the cusp of fainting for roughly 15minutes.

                                                Subjective: 25 yrs old presents with fever, chills, and malaise x 24 hours after receiving a first dose of COVID vaccine yesterday and an MMR booster on the day before. He states he has not had a COVID infection to his knowledge, despite working on the COVID unit at the clinic. Member admits to nausea, fever, chills, hallucination,  and malaise. Denies HA, cp, sob, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, or LE swelling.   A/P: 1. Adverse effect of other viral vaccines, initial encounter Plan/Comment(s):  - 25 yo presents with what is likely a normal adverse reaction in a patient that has been exposed or infected by Coronavirus 19 in the past. He likely contracted the virus while working 2 months on the COVID ward at Clinic, which would be considered an asymptomatic infection. He denies having symptoms of COVID. While he did have an MMR booster the day before receiving the COVID vaccine dose #1, it was my opinion that because of his age and health status at the time of the screening, he was clear to receive the first dose of the COVID vaccine. I did consider possibility of cytokine storm, having been given two vaccines in such close intervals, but again he is young, healthy, and denied having COVID infection in the past,  and he did not exhibit any adverse reactions to the MMR booster.  I anticipate his condition will be self-limiting and the SM will return to full duty in 48 hours.   Reference:   11) Have you received any vaccine in the past 14 days or plan to receive any vaccine in the next 14 days? Currently there is no data on safety or efficacy of a COVID-19 vaccine administered with other vaccines, however, the agency recommends that COVID-19 vaccines be administered alone with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration with any other vaccines. Vaccines required for post-exposure prophylaxis (e.g., rabies vaccine) may be administered within the 14-day period.   ***************Additionally, providers and patients can consider other vaccines, including the influenza vaccine, within the 14-day window on a case-by-case basis with shared clinical decision-making for Health Protection and other important co-administration vaccination needs.************  - will Rx Zofran - will Rx Tylenol - will Rx Motrin - SIQ  48 hours - Patient counseled on dx, tx, and plan; pt understands and concurs

Man working brought me a bottle of water which I chugged, symptoms mostly passed a couple minutes later.  Was still dizzy for another 20 min but after that it passed.

Symptoms included headache, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, feeling feverish, and itching on torso, arms, and legs . Symptoms seemed to improve over the next week or two before worsening again on 3/27/21 around 10:00 am. On the day of 3/27 /21 I experienced headaches, fatigue, brain fog, memory issues, muscle aches, diarrhea, and vision problems. Currently on 3/30/21 symptoms have improved but I am still experiencing dull headaches and brain fog, as well as itching on torso, arms and legs and some vision problems.   I have not seen a provider  for these issues but have an appointment scheduled for 3/31/21. Treatment includes ibuprofen as needed.

                                                I administered the vaccine to Jake and he sat down. About two minutes later, he slumped in his chair. My manager rushed to catch him from falling and I assisted in steadying him. He was breathing erratically, excessively diaphoretic, and his muscles were twitching frequently. His eyes were dilated and he became unresponsive. Fearing a seizure, we lowered him to the floor and turned him on his side. He became responsive and coherent again approximately one minute later and was speaking to us normally. Paramedics arrived several minutes later and took over care. He was taken to the hospital due to abnormal vital signs.

The following day I had a 103 F fever, body aches, chills, migraine, sore muscles, couldn&#39;t walk, excessive thirst. Those effects lasted all day and I felt better on Friday. Saturday night chest pain started along with sore arm getting worse. I took ibuprofen and melatonin to sleep. Woke up Sunday morning and pain came back and gradually got worse until I went into the ER around 9 am. They gave me Morphine to put the chest pain at bay. Then transferred me by ambulance to a different hospital with a cariology department. They treated me as if it was Myocarditis and also got an x-ray of my chest. The next morning I had an MRI and that is what confirmed it to be Myocarditis. I was then discharged with lots of medications to keep the inflammation down.
